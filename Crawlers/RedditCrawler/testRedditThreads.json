My daily symptoms over this time are: urinary pain, pain in my bladder when urine accumulates, randomly occurring genital pain, shallow breathing, sexual activity is painful (only tried once and quickly realized it doesn\u2019t feel good) and the crippling depression and suicidal thoughts that come along with all that. On top of the symptoms I have to do about 4 hours of physio/meditation each day to try and reverse everything that\u2019s wrong with my muscles/nerves/nervous system and some of the physio is very painful/unpleasant. I also feel that I will be alone forever because of the nature of my medical problems and my current situation. I live at home still, am unemployed (I hate going for job interviews cause my bladder pain spikes and I can\u2019t focus on the interview itself), technically still a virgin cause I feel nothing but pain down there. Basically I feel like a complete loser and I\u2019m very upset about how many years of my young adult life has been ruined by these problems. My only friends are my band mates who do nothing but (unintentionally) create a depressing environment for me to be a part of so I don\u2019t enjoy being around them. I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore, I can\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel despite how much time I have to invest into doing my medical routine and people have been telling me things will get better for 8 years and it doesn\u2019t happen.

It was a fulfilling life until that point.\n\nNow, it's all blurry. I am in this big university amd while I did very well on my first couple quarters, I noticed a decline in everything. I realized I had no friends, I dropped a lot of physical activities that I used to do, did the same thing for social event that I used to go to. Eventually, I start not attending classes and not leaving the aparment at all. It started off as pure laziness to attend classes that were boring and ones that have lecture notes posted online too. Then, it spiralled down and I eventually never went back to school other than to submit homework and take exams. By this time I had dropped my grades and had a fail at one class.\n\nI kept thinking that it was just my laziness that brought me to this point.

And I consciously chose to not do them and at the end of everyday I question myself: \"Why did I not do them?\" Next day comes, same thing all over again. I can spend the entire day just sleeping for 10+ hours, waking up to eat, use the bathroom, watch some videos, and then go back to sleep.\n\nIt has been like this for almost half a year now. I tried the \"suck it up and just attend the lectures\" method and it didn't work. I can barely stay there for 1 hour.

I met my now best friend and his family in 2017. I met another of my good friends in late 2018. It is now the end of 2019 and what has happened? Well. I have discovered sushi, met another wonderful friend, found new music and new motivation for life. \n\n2020 has to be the year I make or break it. I want to permanently escape this endless sea of loneliness and despair. I've been given a lifejacket and it's my job to break the surface. \n\nI just want you to know, if you are contemplating, remember this. Had I called it quits in 2016, I never wouldve experienced ANY of this. You know the one thing in common with everything I've said so far? It came out of nowhere. \n\nI met my best friend after his house caught fire. I worked with my other good friend for a total of 3 hours for only 1 shift.
