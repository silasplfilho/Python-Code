I hope you get better and your relationship with your family improves as well. if she is making you feeling like this maybe you can try to better communicate how you feel to her so she understands better how she is making you feel on top of all that you are going through.

Happy birthday! You sound so similar to me that it's crazy! \n\nI'm a 26F loser here, and spent my 26th birthday inpatient. The best thing that happened to me in 2019 was me going to the hospital and getting help. For multiple reasons...\nIt completely changed my family life for the better. In high school, after a traumatic event that happened to my mom in our house, I asked my parents if I could go to therapy because it left me with worsening anxiety and depression, and my dad told me that I'm a perfectly normal teenager and if I needed therapy then every last teenager needs therapy, even though I had just seen my mom attempt and nearly succeed (brother did CPR) in ending her life weeks prior. He finally said that I can go, but also told me that if I dont tell him what happens during my therapy sessions then he isn't paying for it. ($50 a session) \nBut anyways, finally, back in August I almost shot myself and was hospitalized for 36 days and was in intensive therapy for 4 months straight. While inpatient, the very first day, my dad changed his thinking. He started being super supportive of my mental health and has since been amazing towards me. I think the reality set in for him after he realized that he almost lost his youngest daughter. \n\nHave you been inpatient before? It's truly amazing. It puts life outside on a pause, and you can deal with your struggles with professionals. You'll meet some AMAZING people, both staff and patients. I still talk to a few fellow patients I met there, and even hung out with a few on the outside a couple times! It will feel amazing being cared about by your therapists and nurses and techs there. It will feel great being able to take the weight of suicide off your shoulders, because it's impossible in the hospital. You'll feel more like yourself in there and grow greatly. When you're in there, you can also opt for family sessions with your social worker, where your dad could be told by a professional that your mental illness is 100% real and valid. I know it sucks right now with your dad, but I'm really excited for you to go to the hospital because it really is lifechanging. It took 2 back to back admissions (from August to October, 36 days in total between 2 admissions and partial hospitalization program) for me to finally feel like my life is turning around. Nothing much in my life changed except for my thinking, and that's what has saved my life. And most days, I'm even glad I'm alive and I NEVER thought I'd be able to say that! \n\nGood luck in there :) I know it doesnt seem like it now but you're starting 2020 off on the right foot.

Open communication is in my mind the best and most honest way to talk about your feelings and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish you the best of luck, and I hope all goes well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eksegv/you_know_what_fucking_hurts/fddhx6a/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fddhx6a", "created": 1578341795.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1578312995.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_eksegv", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fddwh35", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "psilomide", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_eksegv", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_1j6k6ozd", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "body": "This is why I no longer have any friends🙂", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I no longer have any friends🙂&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eksegv/you_know_what_fucking_hurts/fddwh35/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fddwh35", "created": 1578354470.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1578325670.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_eksegv", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fdemwd8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "mehmehmine", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_eksegv", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_fpmmf", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "body": "That sucks friend.

Your friend is very lucky to have someone vouching for her and trying to get her the help she needs.\n\nYour situation reminds me a lot of certain situations I have been in myself. I've been in both your position and your friend's position. Neither are easy, especially since you're both very young. I was around your age when I experienced both of these situations (I'm 19 now), so I'll try and give you the kind of advice I'd give my younger self about this.\n\nFirst and foremost, if your friend is exhibiting signs that she intends to commit suicide, or is in any kind of immediate danger, you **MUST** ring emergency services immediately. You cannot handle something like this on your own, no matter how much you want to be there for your friend, nor should you be expected to.\n\nYour friend has been showing many signs that her mental health has been in decline for some time now (crying more frequently, eye bags getting darker, less energy, self-harming, etc). Problems sleeping and becoming easily stressed also signify mental health concerns, or perhaps a mental disorder. Well done for identifying these signs and being able to realise that there is something else going on with your friend. A lot of people, especially those who are younger, are often not able to pick up on when something isn't quite right. Even by just seeing these signs, you've helped your friend a lot.\n\nMentioning that she is suicidal to you is a cry for help, and this should **ALWAYS** be taken seriously. Never dismiss this.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n&gt; What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)\n\nI mentioned this above, but I think it's worth repeating this: this is *not* your responsibility. You've done a really great job at supporting your friend and encouraging her to seek help, however you cannot handle this on your own. Assuming this as your responsibility would be incredibly damaging to both of you. Your friend needs professional help from medical experts. It sounds like she is suffering with a mental disorder (maybe depression, maybe something else, only a doctor can determine that). \n\nFurthermore, helping a person who is suicidal can be exhausting, and may stir up some scary feelings for you too. Do not hesitate to seek help from an adult to deal with your own feelings about this, this situation is hard on you too.\n\nYou mentioned that the adults in your life are untrustworthy. How so? Untrustworthy as in unreliable, or untrustworthy meaning they'll report things about your friend? Because if it's the latter, this is actually good thing. Your friend may be upset at first, but telling an adult who can take action and help your friend is paramount here. \n\nMany adults in positions of authority, such as teachers, doctors and mental health practitioners (psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists or school counsellors) are **mandated reporters**. This means that if they are made aware of a serious situation like this one, they are required by law to take action. Telling a teacher at your school that you are concerned your friend is planning to commit suicide means that they will have to act on this and help her. Schools often have protocols and procedures to handle situations such as this one, so they will hopefully be prepared to help your friend. \n\nThe best thing you can do for your friend is to schedule a meeting with a teacher or school counsellor. It may help to take some notes beforehand, to help you remember everything you want to say. Make sure you tell them about the warning signs and new behaviours you've noticed in your friend (including the self-harm), and that she has expressed her intention to commit suicide soon. If she is in immediate danger, contact emergency services, don't wait.\n\n&gt;What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?\nSince we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?\n\nUnfortunately, there is very little you can say to change her perspective. It sounds like your friend has been struggling for a long time, and is dealing with some serious things that require medical attention. When a person is suicidal, they are often not rational and cannot be reasoned with. They genuinely see suicide as the only way out. There's nothing you can say or do to prevent this from happening, she needs professional help.\n\nTo help prevent your friend from committing suicide, you must help her to get the help she needs. Again, because I can never say this enough, **if you believe your friend is in immediate danger, call emergency services**. If your friend expresses that she is suicidal, or if you feel that she may be suicidal, ensure she is not left alone until help arrives, even if she says she has changed her mind, or that she's feeling better.\n\nIt's important to take care of yourself during all of this. And, in the event that your friend does harm herself or attempt/commit suicide, *it is NOT your fault*. You have been going above and beyond for your friend, but there is only so much you can do.\n\nIf you want any more advice on how to deal with this, don't hesitate to ask.

Have you asked any potential friend if they want to hang out? Go get something to eat? Or throw rocks at cats? Or spit on people? no?  Especially that last one, getting your butts kicked together is a real bonding experience.  As far as you know, Im kidding, but seriously, youre putting in the effort, but are you taking the initiative or waiting for someone else to decide?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the way you feel isnt even remotely unique to you, does it sound farfetched that a couple people who may be delighted to be your friend arent simply because they feel the exact same way you do?  I know it may sound intimidating, but try to make plans with people.  Once you start making friends, it can snowball, and you can with effort, and yes, some luck, find yourself with a large circle of friends.  And those relationship wants that you have, those will take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, youre never alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekqsl7/im_19_i_barely_have_friends_and_ive_never_dated/fddvg3n/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fddvg3n", "created": 1578353758.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1578324958.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ekqsl7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fddvm46", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "author": "PlumBunnyPeaches", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ekqsl7", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5cideg5x", "report_reasons": null, "approved_by": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "body": "You don't need people to support you.

You want to get better. You want help. You’re talking here to get advice.  Those aren’t mistakes - that’s someone trying to improve. You deserve it. You owe forgiveness to yourself because despite every thing, here you are. Still kicking. Still fighting. It’s okay to mess up. We fall on our asses, but nothing says you have to stay there. You have worth. You are strong enough. You are forgiven. You are human. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live with many of the same fears as you, and sometimes, they come back to me. Even lying in bed next to a wonderful person, a ring on my finger, I worry he’s going to leave me. Forget me. That I’m going to mess up. But those thoughts, they won’t ruin my life. He has proven me wrong every. single. time. I realize, it’s only me who worries this way, and it sucks, but it’s okay. It’s okay because I can grow and learn and get better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "depression", "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekpdtn/im_tired_of_making_mistakes/fdd57ey/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fdd57ey", "created": 1578324113.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1578295313.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}]

The happy and confident persona you put on might be a facade masking other characteristics, but that persona is nevertheless a part of you. It is a representation of you, albeit a representation you consider fake since you are burdened by depression during others parts of your day. But, it's important to recognize *your sadness does not define you*. It does not always need to be remembered.\n\nI don't know how you've defined half-built relationships. Therefore, I can't judge the truthfulness of your definition. Nevertheless, seeking better relationships is always a good thing. Be proud of yourself for that. It takes guts to demand better.\n\nYour final paragraph is indicative of a larger issue. Where is your kindness? Imagine for a moment your son or daughter or mother or father approaches you. They say \"I'm an overweight wannabe creative. I'm an awkward weirdo. This is who I am.\" What would your response be?
