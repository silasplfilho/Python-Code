I quit alcohol (tbh I just drink like a normal people now) , I got a good job and I tried to have a normal relastionship.I was convinced that this thing that was happening - whatever it was ..it stopped .Until 6 months ago.\n\nI started to have nightmares or sleepless nights again .I couldn't be able to talk to people or have a normal conversation and that is still happening .It's not like I was a social junkie or anything before  but I know that's not normal .I got out of all of my social media I stopped answering calls ,hell I even pretended I didn't even notice the people saying \"Hi\" to me on the street .A few times that I try to talk I just can't ..I won't focus, I won't care even If the person that I'm having a conversation is a friend and I actually care about him/her , I won't listen.I won't go out to hang out , I don't like places with a lot of people like clubs or bars .99% of the time I smile or laugh is forced everyone that knows me could tell and they do , they just don't care \n\nSo anyway my job is going pretty well I even got a promotion last month .I just feel empty .You know , I start to cry randomly even in public places I can't hold it , sometimes I have these situations when I wan't to cry but I can't breath (at least they last for only a few minutes) .I don't like to do anything anymore , the only things I do like is memes and maybe coding a bit in which I slowly starting to lose my  excitement in doing so.I like to sit in parks only during night and stare at my ceiling honestly .Friends and family - I don't know seriously ..Either they notice this and they are not giving a f***, or they don't notice this at all - I honestly have no idea and to be honest I don't care much.I just feel extremely lonely all this time but at the same time I don't wanna be around people at all.\n\nLast thing I want to let you know before you say it :\nYes I already tried a psychologist ,it didn't work for me .I mean I left halfway my visit there .I could see from the things she was telling I was wasting my time there .I know that's a bald statement but seriously she was saying just the same things I looked up online or read in books .\n\nSo what do you guys think?Is something happening here? Should I give psychologist another try?\nI honestly don't know .Anyway thank you for taking the time in reading this and I'm sorry if the post is shitty written .English is not my native language so ..You know",

My mom killed herself last year, I became so depressed I didn't even leave my room for 2 months except to go to the liquor store and then go to work directly across the street. I stopped my gym routine which I'd worked to even make a routine. I lost all the weight I'd gained. I had one friend who was there for me in this time but didn't want to overwhelm him, I lost all my other friends because of this depression. The girl I was seeing at the time ended things with me by posting a picture of herself, with someone she described as \"just a friend\", on a date on Valentines just before my mom's passing. The last person I was seeing in the summer ended up hacking my phone and smart devices and broadcasting all my daily activities in my apartment somehow. Then slept with a former best friend who talks shit about me. I feel like the worst person on the planet because I can't think of any reason I deserved this severe of punishment for anything I've done.\n\nI just needed to vent even though I've posted here before about this. I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to die because it feels like giving up but I honestly haven't felt anything sincerely good for such a long time. I'm starting to think I'm supposed to have died already. I like myself until I'm around people. Being myself is exhausting. I'm tired of having to prove I'm not a piece of shit and still not being believed or loved when I am being honest and myself. I am tired of hearing bad thjngs about myself from inside and out because of this stupid hack and the content that's tailored and fed to me repeatedly.\n\nIf you hack people via reddit, you're a piece of shit and an asshole. \nMaybe this is just giving me the courage I need to end this miserable loser existence.

         "selftext": "So I want to start by apologizing for being chaotic at the moment, but I've been meaning to write this down for a long time. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and PTSD from being raped twice in my life and abused sexually, physically and mentally by the majority of the people I've been with. \nLast year, I was living with people I was really close with, I genuinely felt safe and happy for the first time in years. Long story short, we fell out and the girl that was living there made sure to create the most hostile environment she could, so I couldn't really go out of my room. \nMoving on to right now, I have no one but my amazing boyfriend, or should I say 'had'. We had a fight recently for a VERY small issue that just turned into something huge, because of miscommunication through text. Here I should mention that I'm away from him for five weeks while I'm back to see my family in my home country. Some very hurtful things were said that I don't think I could get over. \nA week ago I found a lump on the side of my jaw, which I mentioned in passing to my mother, who insisted I got it checked out. So I did and they're pretty sure it's a tumor (my dad's side all die from cancer and my aunt was diagnosed with lymphoma a few weeks ago) but I need to wait for the biopsy to come out. \nMy ex knew I was visiting the doctor today, I told him about my doctor's visit and the fact I'll need to have surgery (either way they'll have to remove it), but he completely ignored it and just said 'how convenient'. At this point, I think he was just saying things that he knew would hurt me. That included things like 'no one will put up with you for more than a couple of months' (he tried playing it off that he meant no one else but him),  that I don't make him happy, that I only give a fuck about myself, that my promises mean nothing to him, etc. The only thing I've wanted was to make the people I love happy, I know I can't do much, but I honestly try.. Then while I was messaging my friend (his housemate, whom he had feelings for in the past) and I defended our relationship to her, she said that 'I wouldn't know a healthy relationship if it kicked me in the face'.  So I decided to end things between us, as I wouldn't want to be a toxic, horrible person that makes the people that love them feel like I felt when I was in abusive relationships. He just took that as me not wanting to fight for us, but I just can't unread what he told me these past few days\nNow I feel so, so low, I've been so good in managing my suicidal thoughts but it's been so hard lately, everything has just come crashing down around me, I just feel so helpless. I don't want to go back to where I was, I've started self-harming again, which I haven't done for a long time. I've blocked out my phone notifications, as when I read what he says to me, I just feel more and more worthless and like I'm a burden to everyone around me. \nI know my family would be shattered if I actually killed myself, but I feel like I have nothing and no one, I just want to stop hurting. I don't want to be this horrible, toxic person he says I am, I thought I wasn't. Now I just want everything to end.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I want to start by apologizing for being chaotic at the moment, but I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write this down for a long time. I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and PTSD from being raped twice in my life and abused sexually, physically and mentally by the majority of the people I&amp;#39;ve been with. \nLast year, I was living with people I was really close with, I genuinely felt safe and happy for the first time in years. Long story short, we fell out and the girl that was living there made sure to create the most hostile environment she could, so I couldn&amp;#39;t really go out of my room. \nMoving on to right now, I have no one but my amazing boyfriend, or should I say &amp;#39;had&amp;#39;. We had a fight recently for a VERY small issue that just turned into something huge, because of miscommunication through text. Here I should mention that I&amp;#39;m away from him for five weeks while I&amp;#39;m back to see my family in my home country. Some very hurtful things were said that I don&amp;#39;t think I could get over. \nA week ago I found a lump on the side of my jaw, which I mentioned in passing to my mother, who insisted I got it checked out. So I did and they&amp;#39;re pretty sure it&amp;#39;s a tumor (my dad&amp;#39;s side all die from cancer and my aunt was diagnosed with lymphoma a few weeks ago) but I need to wait for the biopsy to come out. \nMy ex knew I was visiting the doctor today, I told him about my doctor&amp;#39;s visit and the fact I&amp;#39;ll need to have surgery (either way they&amp;#39;ll have to remove it), but he completely ignored it and just said &amp;#39;how convenient&amp;#39;. At this point, I think he was just saying things that he knew would hurt me. That included things like &amp;#39;no one will put up with you for more than a couple of months&amp;#39; (he tried playing it off that he meant no one else but him),  that I don&amp;#39;t make him happy, that I only give a fuck about myself, that my promises mean nothing to him, etc. The only thing I&amp;#39;ve wanted was to make the people I love happy, I know I can&amp;#39;t do much, but I honestly try.. Then while I was messaging my friend (his housemate, whom he had feelings for in the past) and I defended our relationship to her, she said that &amp;#39;I wouldn&amp;#39;t know a healthy relationship if it kicked me in the face&amp;#39;.  So I decided to end things between us, as I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be a toxic, horrible person that makes the people that love them feel like I felt when I was in abusive relationships. He just took that as me not wanting to fight for us, but I just can&amp;#39;t unread what he told me these past few days\nNow I feel so, so low, I&amp;#39;ve been so good in managing my suicidal thoughts but it&amp;#39;s been so hard lately, everything has just come crashing down around me, I just feel so helpless. I don&amp;#39;t want to go back to where I was, I&amp;#39;ve started self-harming again, which I haven&amp;#39;t done for a long time. I&amp;#39;ve blocked out my phone notifications, as when I read what he says to me, I just feel more and more worthless and like I&amp;#39;m a burden to everyone around me. \nI know my family would be shattered if I actually killed myself, but I feel like I have nothing and no one, I just want to stop hurting. I don&amp;#39;t want to be this horrible, toxic person he says I am, I thought I wasn&amp;#39;t. Now I just want everything to end. At the same time, my ex&amp;#39;s housemate killed himself when he was in Uni and I don&amp;#39;t want him to go through that, or go through the guilt of thinking he could&amp;#39;ve done something to prevent it.

But whenever I start to work on improving myself or plan to do something about my life I just end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed to the point where I just have to play videogames or consume some sort of media to distract myself and before I know it a month has passed and I&amp;#39;m back at square 1. I try to learn the piano, start a business or something similar, start to work out or even just push myself to get a better job but I always end up either stressing out or talking myself out of it.

And the full force of the reality of it hit me mid-video and I threw my phone across the room. I don\u2019t want to have kids. I\u2019ve said it 100 times and it hasn\u2019t ever hurt this much to say. \n\nI\u2019m turning 20 in a few weeks and I\u2019m in college. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend right now and I am in absolutely no position to have a kid anyway. But I know I want one in the future. And I know i\u2019ve been telling myself I don\u2019t want any for a myriad of reasons. But it hasn\u2019t worked. I want to be a father. I want to be the best father I can be. \n\nBut god even if I get the chance, I cannot willingly bring an infant into this world. I cannot look my flesh &amp; blood in the eyes and give them that kind of responsibility. The world we know is going to end. I have no doubt about that. I don\u2019t think we will wiped out, but the lives we have had the privilege to lead will not be available for our kids. \n\nWe grew up not understanding frugality. We spent as much as we could allow ourselves to spend. And that isn\u2019t just money. The people who should have been more aware of the impending consequences, our parents and grandparents, aren\u2019t going to survive to see the worst of it. We basked in the environment that we were told we could live in. And we won\u2019t be able to do that for our children.\n\nI can\u2019t wake up everyday wondering how I\u2019m going to get water for my kid to drink. Or food for my kid to eat. I can\u2019t wake up everyday wondering if my child\u2019s weakened immune system will finally succumb to the bacterial/viral beatings that climate change will unleash onto us. I don\u2019t know how we are going to power our world. How many times will I have to tell my child they can\u2019t sleep with a night-light? \n\nThis world will be rigged for the rich, and I have no plans to become a rich man. While the rich will continue to hire their own personal fire fighters (like they did in California this summer), and continue to live extravagantly on the few finite resources we have left, the rest of us will suffer from it. My generation is already doomed. We are the ones that have to try to change the world to stave off something worse. We have to willingly reduce our own quality of life, to prevent the complete destruction of it. \n\nWe were not taught this, and I have no faith that we will learn it soon enough to prevent what\u2019s coming.\n\nSo I will not bring a child into this world. Because It\u2019s already a fucking crime that I brought into this world anyway. The family values that our ancestors have cherished for so long are gone.\n\nMy parents won\u2019t be grandparents, and neither will I. Because if I do it, I\u2019m being JUST as willfully ignorant as their generation was.\n\nTo the future kid whom I hope I never see, I love you and I\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t get to experience the beautiful childhood I was given.",

I chopped my hair off (I made sure there was enough to donate to a wig making charity) and I did it because people kept complimenting it. I feel like I, as a whole, am completely lacking any reason to seem or appear pleasant or appealing. I feel like my appearance should match the shitty person that it represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading. Any sort of experience or insight would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all managing as well as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "I would like to know where the fuck I stand in the big, goal deprived game that life is. Is that too much to ask for. Who the fuck am I, what the fuck are my core values? Man, they used to tell me that teenage years are a tough period full of self doubt and development. Fuck it man, I felt none of that. The twenties is were it's at. I'm just there sitting in a corner trying to figure my life out and being plagued with a REALLY FUCKING PERSISTENT existential crisis, hanging on the the hopes instilled by a few internet strangers that said it gets better in your thirties.\n\nI always feel like I'm failing somewhere, in everything I do. As I am writing to you right now, I feel I failed at thinking through things on my own ; As I feel I failed at thinking through things on my own, I fear I will be a drag by opening up to others, including you, because I'm always plagued with one issue or another that just cannot be solved by talking it out with friends, and maybe just cannot be solved at all (unless it's just a part of the existential crisis that is supposed to get better in your thirties, what the fuck do I know?). I always think ''You're a fucking adult, act like it, solve shit on your own like you're supposed to'' , then nothing works, then I start relying on other people despite telling myself I wouldn't, then I drag them down trying to convince myself I'm doing a good thing.\n\nI fucking hate being myself and I don't know how to get better, I keep holding on but I always wonder WHY, because nothing ever really makes sense. Nothing ever really gets to me.  I don't even know why I'm telling you all of this.  I act like a little broken machine, so randomly.  One hour thinking this one thing and then the other thinking the complete opposite, I bet I will regret all of this very very soon and you know what, the best/worst part is that I will actually believe I am better than that. The mood swings are getting pretty crazy.\n\nI'm trying to keep it together but I can just FEEL my mind unravel and fall out of reach. And if I do not even have my mind by my side, then I have nothing.\n\nEvery word I say and write feels like a play, nothing feels real enough, nothing feels close enough to me, that ''me'' I'm not even sure I really know anymore, and by not knowing who I am, I can't connect to anyone either.  It feels like everybody is miles, MILES away. Everything is so distant, I feel like a stranger in my own skin.\n\nAnd this might be the ONE time I am actually able to put words on it while talking to anyone, even by myself usually it's so hard even though I KNOW that's how it is, it's one thing to know it and one thing to be able to think about it, even if those things are always there and deeply affecting and breaking me every second that goes by.\n\nI'm tired, hanging on, trying to find a hint of stability in my mental world I feel is only strangling ''me'' or whoever these random and contradictiory shreds of counsciousness are fucking trying to be... But still, so very tired, and wondering if that one part of me that is somehow STILL trying to hold everything together and get better isn't just a byproduct of survival instinct. Survival instinct can be a real bitch I think. Is that just this one very primitive part of me speaking whenever I try to tell myself that things will get better, that I will find a way to thrive?\n\nMayble I'll find a way to ''recycle'' myself and despite being different than I used to be, I'll be able to feel at home in my own mind. But I always feel like the cogs are disaligned. It's so hard to explain because I have a hard time even getting a real grasp of it.\n\nIt's like EVERYTHING in my head... Is ever so slightly out of place. Everything is somewhat functional, but nothing... Is... ''How it should be''. I just.... KNOW it, I feel it, nothing is how it should be even though I can get by with everything. And over time, it gets so hard to bear.\n\nYou wonder why I always get back to thinking you will eventually cut me out of your life, I had such a hard time trying to explain it to you, but it's so clear now. I'm toxic as fuck.\n\nI'm a mess, I have nothing good to offer, and I have a hard time believing there is any progress in sight. I am not the kind of person who will push you further in life. I am not the kind of person that can support you in any way. I can only bring you down. Some people feel down and then feel better with a bit of pep talk from their friends. I'm not that kind of person, and you know it. I am an endless funnel, I am a black hole that will keep absorbing all the energy I can to no avail. If I had any real, honest advice to give, to ANYONE, it would be to run, run, run, run as far as they can before they let me get a grip.\n\nIf I am feeling or acting like I am feeling good I feel like one of the biggest liars on earth.\n\nIf I am NOT acting like I am feeling good, I feel like I am a pointless drag.\n\nThere is no good option.\n\nI used to think I had it bad, maybe I did, maybe.\n\nBut I can only dream of that mental state I used to have now, I think. I wish I could go back to being unwell while at least not feeling like something is terribly, terribly wrong with my whole being all the time.\n\nI think I really crossed a line, and I feel so lonely. Nothing gets to me. And it's like my mind is slowly dying.\n\nI'm sitting there trying to do therapy homework while everything in my head is just going blank whenever I try to think things trough.\n\nMy mind is telling me that I can do better than that and it's like halfway inbetween beating me down, BITCH YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT, WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING BETTER THAN THAT, and trying to support me and genuinely saying that if I just try enough (JUST TRY ENOUGH), that if I just keep believing (YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT), then maybe I will achieve something (BUT WHAT GOOD WILL IT BRING FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU, HEH!?)\n\nIt really is a mental warfare, and it's sucking the life out of me. There is no consistency.\n\nI am no good. I am one of the weaks, I feel like I am already part of the dead. Maybe in a few hours I'll feel different. But right now. And this is probably the most brutally honest I have ever been. I just feel like I'm dying. I feel like... I went back from quite a lot of things in life. Of course there is always someone to have it worse, and I know that there is an INCREDIBLE amount of people who actually have had it worse than me. My life has actually been pretty fine, I am aware of that. But in my head it's still hell. As I said... Maybe it's just because I am one of the weaks.\n\nJust in case you got a bit worked up from reading all of this... I'm doing fine, as in, I'm not ACTUALLY going to fucking die, not today at least, and altough I can't guarantee anything for the future I have no plan. I'm in therapy. I know the suicide hotline's number for if I ever want to use it. My boyfriend is aware I'm having suicidal ideations. I have tools. Like... Doing three short walks a week, developping my cooking skills, and talking of the results to my therapist haha. And doing the homework. Most of me think it's utter bullshit right now but who knows, maybe it's just because I am off my fucking rocker and that's just it. It's just the beginning, maybe if I keep doing these things and whatever is to come through therapy I will get better. I have to give myself a chance and believe. OR maybe that's just the survival instinct speaking, trying to keep this old bitch alive. So many possibilities, and no clarity. Anyways. I guess the only thing I wanted to do tonight is fight this incredibly painful distance I feel from everyone, be it imaginary or not. I though, maybe it's because I never say enough. I shouldn't ever say too much because I will drag them down, but if I don't tell I will always feel alone. So there it is. Just don't freak out.\n\nThank you, good night, talk to you later, and sorry even though I always ALWAYS hate to say sorry.\n\nYeah, okay, I thing I'm really done for tonight. After having written like, the whole fucking script for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to know where the fuck I stand in the big, goal deprived game that life is. Is that too much to ask for. Who the fuck am I, what the fuck are my core values? Man, they used to tell me that teenage years are a tough period full of self doubt and development. Fuck it man, I felt none of that. The twenties is were it&amp;#39;s at. I&amp;#39;m just there sitting in a corner trying to figure my life out and being plagued with a REALLY FUCKING PERSISTENT existential crisis, hanging on the the hopes instilled by a few internet strangers that said it gets better in your thirties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always feel like I&amp;#39;m failing somewhere, in everything I do. As I am writing to you right now, I feel I failed at thinking through things on my own ; As I feel I failed at thinking through things on my own, I fear I will be a drag by opening up to others, including you, because I&amp;#39;m always plagued with one issue or another that just cannot be solved by talking it out with friends, and maybe just cannot be solved at all (unless it&amp;#39;s just a part of the existential crisis that is supposed to get better in your thirties, what the fuck do I know?). I always think &amp;#39;&amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re a fucking adult, act like it, solve shit on your own like you&amp;#39;re supposed to&amp;#39;&amp;#39; , then nothing works, then I start relying on other people despite telling myself I wouldn&amp;#39;t, then I drag them down trying to convince myself I&amp;#39;m doing a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate being myself and I don&amp;#39;t know how to get better, I keep holding on but I always wonder WHY, because nothing ever really makes sense. Nothing ever really gets to me.  I don&amp;#39;t even know why I&amp;#39;m telling you all of this.  I act like a little broken machine, so randomly.  One hour thinking this one thing and then the other thinking the complete opposite, I bet I will regret all of this very very soon and you know what, the best/worst part is that I will actually believe I am better than that. The mood swings are getting pretty crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to keep it together but I can just FEEL my mind unravel and fall out of reach. And if I do not even have my mind by my side, then I have nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every word I say and write feels like a play, nothing feels real enough, nothing feels close enough to me, that &amp;#39;&amp;#39;me&amp;#39;&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;m not even sure I really know anymore, and by not knowing who I am, I can&amp;#39;t connect to anyone either.  It feels like everybody is miles, MILES away. Everything is so distant, I feel like a stranger in my own skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this might be the ONE time I am actually able to put words on it while talking to anyone, even by myself usually it&amp;#39;s so hard even though I KNOW that&amp;#39;s how it is, it&amp;#39;s one thing to know it and one thing to be able to think about it, even if those things are always there and deeply affecting and breaking me every second that goes by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired, hanging on, trying to find a hint of stability in my mental world I feel is only strangling &amp;#39;&amp;#39;me&amp;#39;&amp;#39; or whoever these random and contradictiory shreds of counsciousness are fucking trying to be... But still, so very tired, and wondering if that one part of me that is somehow STILL trying to hold everything together and get better isn&amp;#39;t just a byproduct of survival instinct. Survival instinct can be a real bitch I think. Is that just this one very primitive part of me speaking whenever I try to tell myself that things will get better, that I will find a way to thrive?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mayble I&amp;#39;ll find a way to &amp;#39;&amp;#39;recycle&amp;#39;&amp;#39; myself and despite being different than I used to be, I&amp;#39;ll be able to feel at home in my own mind. But I always feel like the cogs are disaligned. It&amp;#39;s so hard to explain because I have a hard time even getting a real grasp of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like EVERYTHING in my head... Is ever so slightly out of place. Everything is somewhat functional, but nothing... Is... &amp;#39;&amp;#39;How it should be&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. I just.... KNOW it, I feel it, nothing is how it should be even though I can get by with everything. And over time, it gets so hard to bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You wonder why I always get back to thinking you will eventually cut me out of your life, I had such a hard time trying to explain it to you, but it&amp;#39;s so clear now.

She\u2019s fallen into the deepest and darkest depressive episode I\u2019ve seen from her yet and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being there for her in the right capacity. \n\nWhen I\u2019m depressed, I know all the things I should be doing to feel better I just can\u2019t bring myself to do any of them. I have minimal energy and I can\u2019t make any decisions for myself regarding positive change. HOWEVER if a friend or loved one reaches out and makes the decisions for me or pushes me to just go on a walk with them or do some simple positive activity with them, I can be convinced to do it and the more I do, the better I start to feel over time. I don\u2019t have many walls up and if someone offers to listen, I have no issue clearing my head space. \n\nShe\u2019s very different. She has impenetrable walls up. We live around the corner from each other so I\u2019m always offering to come over and talk or go for a run together or stay in and watch a movie together and she always turns it down. The only thing that can get her out of the house is an activity involving alcohol but I think that\u2019s a huge factor messing with her brain chemistry. The only times she\u2019s truly opened up to me is when she\u2019s drunk. She\u2019s struggling financially and working two jobs. Any solution I try to give her she turns down or says what\u2019s the point. She truly sees no joy or point in living so she has the mindset of why even try? Sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how little she is willing to help herself or accept help from me and then I feel guilty for getting frustrated!! \n\nI am in no way trying to compare how we deal with our depression or say my way is better than hers I\u2019m just simply at a loss. I\u2019m wondering if anyone on here can relate to her type of depression and how you\u2019d want me to handle it. Am I being too overbearing? Should I step back a little? How do I get her to want to stop drinking and try some positive life changes without sounding condescending? How do I get her the motivation to want to be happy again? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post. I love my cousin so much and she is a hilarious awesome fun light of my life and I want her to live a life she deserves.",

She\u2019s fallen into the deepest and darkest depressive episode I\u2019ve seen from her yet and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being there for her in the right capacity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I\u2019m depressed, I know all the things I should be doing to feel better I just can\u2019t bring myself to do any of them. I have minimal energy and I can\u2019t make any decisions for myself regarding positive change. HOWEVER if a friend or loved one reaches out and makes the decisions for me or pushes me to just go on a walk with them or do some simple positive activity with them, I can be convinced to do it and the more I do, the better I start to feel over time. I don\u2019t have many walls up and if someone offers to listen, I have no issue clearing my head space. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s very different. She has impenetrable walls up. We live around the corner from each other so I\u2019m always offering to come over and talk or go for a run together or stay in and watch a movie together and she always turns it down. The only thing that can get her out of the house is an activity involving alcohol but I think that\u2019s a huge factor messing with her brain chemistry. The only times she\u2019s truly opened up to me is when she\u2019s drunk. She\u2019s struggling financially and working two jobs. Any solution I try to give her she turns down or says what\u2019s the point. She truly sees no joy or point in living so she has the mindset of why even try? Sometimes it\u2019s frustrating how little she is willing to help herself or accept help from me and then I feel guilty for getting frustrated!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in no way trying to compare how we deal with our depression or say my way is better than hers I\u2019m just simply at a loss. I\u2019m wondering if anyone on here can relate to her type of depression and how you\u2019d want me to handle it. Am I being too overbearing? Should I step back a little? How do I get her to want to stop drinking and try some positive life changes without sounding condescending? How do I get her the motivation to want to be happy again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sorry for the long post. I love my cousin so much and she is a hilarious awesome fun light of my life and I want her to live a life she deserves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Just to sit there absent mindedly until the day was over. I never put any effort into my school work, or homework. I would throw papers in my backpack and leave them there for the rest of the year.. half of the time I wouldn't even bring a backpack with me anymore because I got sick of lugging it around. \nWhen I was younger I always tried to fit in with the other kids but they were just so uninterested in being friends with me.. I could never understand why and I just assumed that I was a nobody, a loser. \nI wasn't always shy... At my old school my friends loved me, I felt accepted there. My confidence went down the drain when I moved to that small town, I felt like I had things going for me, and those people snuffed that young, ambitious me.. this was in the 5th grade. \n\nI would always try to sign up for soccer and my mom would always come up with an excuse as to why I couldn't.. basketball, soccer, any kind of after school activity was a no go. My parents would buy me anything I wanted, I had a big interest in electronics, computers and video games. Growing up, I always felt like my friends wanted to hangout with me because of my huge video game collection. Further cementing the fact that I'm a loser with nothing to offer. I could go ride bikes with my friends, but the few \"decent\" friends I had stopped liking me. We would go ride bikes or go fishing and they would hound me and beg me the entire time to go back to my place and play video games. After I said no enough times, they would just get frustrated and go home. I was always doing stuff alone.. my mom was such a basket case she wouldn't let me spend the night at people's houses or be out after a certain time.. her obsessive paranoia bullshit definitely rubbed off on me. And I hate how I see my mother in me more than anyone else. \n\nSo I started just being on the computer all the time, chatting with my internet friends, being on web forums. And I slowly just lost the interest to go out and do anything.. I was perfectly content to just sit home and do nothing. The internet was my escape from my boring life, where I was just invalidated constantly. I started to come out of my shell when I was 17 or 18. I'm a 28 year old guy now.

It\u2019s stuck with me for six years now and it\u2019s even more difficult to deal with when there isn\u2019t a situation to blame it on.  \n\nDepression has a way of bleeding into every single part of your life. It doesn\u2019t only eat away at you and your own self confidence and happiness, but it has a way of destroying the relationships you once had. The relationships you didn\u2019t have to put effort into slowly fall apart. Your friends that haven\u2019t experienced depression don\u2019t understand and perceive your lack of socializing as not being interested in the relationship. Your family members say things like \u201csometimes you have to decide you\u2019re going to be happy.\u201d Don\u2019t you think I would be happy if it were as easy as just deciding that was what I wanted? \n\nDepression even damages the relationships with those who understand. My husband experiences his own depression, but his understanding only goes so far. My continued sadness and anger over how I feel inevitably breaks him down bit by bit. My intention is never to bring anyone else down with me but, during almost every dark time, I manage to knock him down too. \n\nWhen I\u2019m in a period of depression, each day is a struggle from the time I wake up from the time I finally fall asleep. I stay in bed until the last possible second because I don\u2019t want to face the day. I push down my feelings, so I can do my job to the best of my ability and be what my patients need and deserve. But by the time I get home, everything is sucked out of me. I\u2019m exhausted from hiding my own feelings and struggles and taking on my patients\u2019 needs. I want to just fall into my husband\u2019s arms and sob, but he needs me too. A marriage isn\u2019t one sided and there\u2019s only so much support my husband can give before he needs some in return. \n\nIt\u2019s a lonely, lonely experience.

I thought I was doing well because I had a perfect score on every assignment so far but now I don't know what's going to happen. I feel lost and numb. I dread getting a bad grade but, more than that, I feel absolutely ASHAMED of what I've done. I know this might sound trivial but this is the only thing that matters to me; in the past four years, I've given up on social life, parties, holidays and what not because I wanted to do well and go to grad school. And now it's all going to crash and burn. I feel so ashamed that I would be submitting this abomination of a project. As a female in a highly computational major, I always wondered if I suffered from imposter syndrome; but the truth is that I'm an imposter with no calibre for the field that I'm in. I don't know what to do, everything I've worked for is going to crumble.  Just yesterday the P.I. that I was working with offered to advise me on grad school and even told me he'd be my reference and honestly my heart sank because this probably won't happen. I'm 23 and I am nowhere; not smart, no great personality or charm, no traveling the world, getting a decent paycheck, and not even a SO (not that you need one but it pinches to be single when all your friends are in serious relationships). I know it is trivial and pathetic to obsess over grades and school but this is all I have; in fact, at this point, this is all I am. I don't what I'm going to do but just the thought of turning in that ghastly project tonight and being revealed as this imposter makes me feel so ashamed that I can't even look myself in the eyes. I think my aspirations are out of touch with my realities but it's too late to do anything. I've ruined it for myself, and I don't know what I'm going to do after this.",

Someone please save me because I dont want to peel, away from everyone that i love, im trying to find hope but I cant find your white dove, drowning in my own thoughts and depression, life has me messed up and I cant seem to learn my lesson.\n\nI'm not sad I'm just broken, tired of the lies and cant find what was stolen, once was happy and felt so golden then I was torn apart and now I'm feeling so hopeless. Life has me the gutters and now I'm so disappointed i thought itd be better but i was too early spoken.

I still have yet to pay my rent and I will likely be evicted. I haven\u2019t paid the rent because I haven\u2019t worked in over a month due to depression. So yesterday was the final day of my extension and I didn\u2019t pay it, I was talking to my girlfriend and I was spiraling into an episode because of all the stress about losing my place. I\u2019ve been suicidal for like almost 4 years and I\u2019ve attempted a couple of times, anyway I kept spiraling until I got to the point where I was telling my girlfriend goodbye, I was writing my roommate a note and I had already had the noose around my neck for an hour at that point just to get ready. I knew how I was gonna do it and where I was gonna do it. I was absolutely going to do it, I was ready this time. I told my girlfriend goodbye and suddenly someone rings the fuck out of my doorbell and I open my bedroom door to LED lights shining down my hallway and I\u2019m like fuck. I knew it was the police so I answer the door. What a fucking mistake. The police say they\u2019re here for a welfare check and I\u2019m like okay, who called? Won\u2019t tell me. They ask if everything\u2019s alright and I\u2019m not having any of it, I was super shitty to them at first. There were 3 fucking cop cars and an ambulance (and a second ambulance showed up later for some reason?) and all my neighbors could see, the whole ordeal was insane, I had no idea this could happen. I was detained at my own house. Anyway they accuse me of making threats on my life which I denied to get them to leave and supposedly my girlfriend sent them screenshots of my texts as proof, after about 2 hours and a bunch of crazy bull shit I was arrested and taken to the hospital where they took my things and locked them up and I was detained for 14 hours where I was forced to follow medical procedures, which I didn\u2019t even consent to when I came in the hospital but apparently that doesn\u2019t matter??\nMy girlfriend and I are broken up now as the whole ordeal was traumatic and I hate myself for what I\u2019ve done to her, no one should ever have to go through what I put her through and that is my biggest regret from the whole experience. Anyway, I wanted to post this just to get it out, even if no one reads it. But if you read this and you got to the end, thanks for taking the time. I still want to kill myself. I still have no way to pay my rent. Life will always be terrible. Peace",

         "selftext": "My life is in the midst of coming to a conclusion. My mother and I recently caught my father having a mistress, and he has left us for her with nothing. My father never sent me to college. I worked a year singing in bars and it was alright at first, but I didn't realize that that life had led me to my severe anxiety. For the past few months, I've stopped working so I could try to battle this and become a functioning human being again. My issue isn't taken as seriously in Malaysia.\n\nIt is now up to me to handle all the bills (rent+internet+water/electric+carinstallment=USD500) and I'm left with no clue how to proceed. I have no qualifications, my anxiety will get the better of me if I go back to singing in bars, and I'll have to give up on my dreams of making music and streaming. The only option I have is to pump in ALL of my hours being a waiter, just to barely make the bills every month. I know what most people will say (as I've heard so many times before): \"You just have to suck it up.\" \"Not everyone achieves their dreams.\"\n\nBut right now, even though I will have to do it, it fucking hurts so bad. To make the decision to let everything go. To make the decision to let the very essence of who I am go. When I played the songs I wrote in front of a crowd of strangers. Them coming up to me to tell me they really like these songs that came from my brain and my heart. When I stream and people become \"regular viewers\" and tell me I'm their favorite streamer. There were some of the only times in my entire life, that I felt like my existence wasn't a mistake.\n\nI just wasn't given enough time... I know some of it is on me. If I had gotten my driver's license earlier, I could've been able to drive Grab (Asian Uber) by now. If I had just stood my ground, my music would've been taking flight by now. If I hadn't abandoned streaming to spend all my days working in bars because my father convinced me to \"support the family\", I would've been able to be somebody by now. I regret all of it so, so much. I wish I could take it all back and do it right...\n\nI'm scared that eventually, I'm going to decide to take my own life. I know it's the easy out but... All I wanted was a normal family, a supportive father who believes in his son and is proud of his efforts and achievements. I looked up to him.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life is in the midst of coming to a conclusion. My mother and I recently caught my father having a mistress, and he has left us for her with nothing. My father never sent me to college. I worked a year singing in bars and it was alright at first, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize that that life had led me to my severe anxiety. For the past few months, I&amp;#39;ve stopped working so I could try to battle this and become a functioning human being again. My issue isn&amp;#39;t taken as seriously in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is now up to me to handle all the bills (rent+internet+water/electric+carinstallment=USD500) and I&amp;#39;m left with no clue how to proceed. I have no qualifications, my anxiety will get the better of me if I go back to singing in bars, and I&amp;#39;ll have to give up on my dreams of making music and streaming. The only option I have is to pump in ALL of my hours being a waiter, just to barely make the bills every month. I know what most people will say (as I&amp;#39;ve heard so many times before): &amp;quot;You just have to suck it up.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Not everyone achieves their dreams.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But right now, even though I will have to do it, it fucking hurts so bad. To make the decision to let everything go. To make the decision to let the very essence of who I am go. When I played the songs I wrote in front of a crowd of strangers. Them coming up to me to tell me they really like these songs that came from my brain and my heart. When I stream and people become &amp;quot;regular viewers&amp;quot; and tell me I&amp;#39;m their favorite streamer. There were some of the only times in my entire life, that I felt like my existence wasn&amp;#39;t a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just wasn&amp;#39;t given enough time... I know some of it is on me. If I had gotten my driver&amp;#39;s license earlier, I could&amp;#39;ve been able to drive Grab (Asian Uber) by now. If I had just stood my ground, my music would&amp;#39;ve been taking flight by now. If I hadn&amp;#39;t abandoned streaming to spend all my days working in bars because my father convinced me to &amp;quot;support the family&amp;quot;, I would&amp;#39;ve been able to be somebody by now. I regret all of it so, so much. I wish I could take it all back and do it right...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared that eventually, I&amp;#39;m going to decide to take my own life. I know it&amp;#39;s the easy out but... All I wanted was a normal family, a supportive father who believes in his son and is proud of his efforts and achievements. I looked up to him. I always envisioned myself on stage accepting awards, or on Graham Norton or something, with my father looking on proudly in the audience. I never would&amp;#39;ve dreamed that he didn&amp;#39;t even give a single shit. I never would&amp;#39;ve dreamed that all USD43000 of his pension was not spent sending me to college, getting me a car or even getting me a driver&amp;#39;s license, instead, if was spent on drinking in bars and secretly providing for his mistress and HER son.

It would mean the world to me be able to support my mother and myself but not have to give up on my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "okay, this might be boring and very long post but i hope i can find some answers. So, before everything if you're reading this thank you.\n\nabout 1,5 years ago my bestfriend became my bf and our friendship has almost 10 years. Everything started perfect, and in the first time in my life i felt what love is. In that time he also had some depression but he never went a doc or sth. And I had bipolar, adhd and depression which were almost that time diagnosed. I was cutting myself, hurting etc. But, after him everything changed the feelings were so strong, because we also bestfriends which made it perfect. Ofcourse, nothing is a fairytale...\n\nHis drinking problems started first and drug use, he started not working, staying at home all day and night drinking and fighting with me. I tried everything to help him but nothing works he was just living everything by hisself. We had to moved a cheaper house and i was trying to saving money for the rent and started almost eating nothing, while i was losing weight and getting really depressed he was still drinking all day long, spending time on his phone and screaming to me.. In that time just because i was sitting, he was coming and screaming like \"you are useless, fuck off etc\" mostly, these times i cut myself like next day when i wake up he was sitting on the bed like crying and saying \"i saw blood everywhere i know i did sth really bad, I'm really sorry, please don't go\" i also tried to jump from our balcony but he stopped me. \n\nwhen all these shitty things were happening, and after my surgery, i got pregnant.... and he was like you can keep it maybe it can help us to work harder or get things together. And i believed because i was really happy to carrying his baby inside me. but somehow i saw that nothing will change and i got abortion..... ofcourse he was not there with me and i had to through all those awfull things by myself. \n\nThen, one day my father came and saw me like that, unhappy, very skinny, unhealthy and thanks to him i grabbed my some stuff and left the house that night. I was already alone in the house and couldn't eat or even sleep. After i left i went to my mom's and stay alone just tried to heal. After 2 months somehow we got back together his life were changed, he was living with strangers, house was like open shelter. But, i was really missed him and stay with him couple days, he seems changed. He introduced me to his cousins and he was really loving me. Then, i heard some mystery calls and i got suspicious, i asked but he didn't care. \n\nthen, i helped him to moved his family home again and spend couple nights in his family house, he was speaking with me but he had a distance, he was going out when i'm staying with his family and came home drunk in 4 am. couple days later when i was sitting his home and he was in the living room, he texted me \"i don't want to speak or live sth for now\" i asked if someone has in his life but he said no, and i left. I gave him time did not call, write or anything because i thought he was struggling many problems in his life, he always felted me like that, drinking problems, family issues, debts etc.\n\nSo, we decided to stay as friends because i care about him and wanted to stay beside him for help everything he through.  Everything was normal, he was randomly texting me, we were playing games, chatting and couple days ago i said \"hey, let's meet so we can play games and spend some friend time together like old days\"\n\nAnd he said like nothing \"i can't because i am in a relationship with someone else, ofcourse we can stay friends but nothing will be same as you wanted....\" i asked him who is she and when these all started because he was having sex and spending time with me all those times. He did not even answer, i thought she is someone i know and everything started when we were together. Also he see hisself right because i left him??? he was nearly hitting me and hurting me i had to run away for a bit for both of us. My goal was heaing and giving time to us, i never thought to end this. He was the first love of my life and i dreamed to live, marry and die with only him. \n\nbefore this text, i was almost healed, my anxiety were gone, i was feeling so much better. Now, i lost my all hope, i don't want to speak, walk, doing something, even speaking with someone everything is so hard for me. I did not deserve what he is done, and i just can't believe he forgot me and started to have sex with someone else, spending time with her. I thought he was havinf bad time but it turns out that he was with someone else of all those times. Before everything we were friends, even for that he did not show some respect to me or don't bother to make an explanation or maybe even: \"i'm sorry\"\n\nSo, I can not sleep now, all i do is crying, my heart and my whole body hurts me. I know maybe one day everything will pass but now i just can't handle. I'm trying to do things for not thinking but nothing works. I always trying to find ways to die, but i have a family and pets who will be destroy by this and because of that i'm just trying and trying..... Taking pills to sleep and taking ritalin to just wake up, even those are not working. Suicide seems the only option for me and i'm sure even this not provide him to think what he has done. Death seems really peacefull, because now i'm not just hurting my self, i also effect my family and friends. I feel useless, i have no job rn, living with my family, i'm just a burden to them.",

Now, i lost my all hope, i don&amp;#39;t want to speak, walk, doing something, even speaking with someone everything is so hard for me. I did not deserve what he is done, and i just can&amp;#39;t believe he forgot me and started to have sex with someone else, spending time with her. I thought he was havinf bad time but it turns out that he was with someone else of all those times. Before everything we were friends, even for that he did not show some respect to me or don&amp;#39;t bother to make an explanation or maybe even: &amp;quot;i&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I can not sleep now, all i do is crying, my heart and my whole body hurts me. I know maybe one day everything will pass but now i just can&amp;#39;t handle. I&amp;#39;m trying to do things for not thinking but nothing works. I always trying to find ways to die, but i have a family and pets who will be destroy by this and because of that i&amp;#39;m just trying and trying..... Taking pills to sleep and taking ritalin to just wake up, even those are not working. Suicide seems the only option for me and i&amp;#39;m sure even this not provide him to think what he has done. Death seems really peacefull, because now i&amp;#39;m not just hurting my self, i also effect my family and friends. I feel useless, i have no job rn, living with my family, i&amp;#39;m just a burden to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It wasn't like I was ok before that...but that was like MAJOR major. Also had intense paranoia. Like nobody cared and everyone was out to get me smh. Wanted to die yet was afraid of death. Hell of a time... literal hell. I remember people around me noticing something was wrong...my parents, teachers but nobody did anything constructive. Anyway I got better for a while...hit puberty, got busy with school and stuff. Wasn't very happy...but it was fine. At 15 I changed schools and it hit again. My grades fell and I felt so intensely lonely. I'm also very socially awkward on top of that. Got better again graduated school.\n\nCollege started fine but within a few months it was back with vengeance. Lasted over a year. Got really bad... started self harming for the first time. I came out 1.5 yrs in college and since then it got a bit better. A lot better. Started living a healthier life, made friends and I was truly happy for a while there. It was also then I realised for the first time what it was like to feel \"normal\". Realised I was indeed depressed all this time. Anyway I really thought, stupidly perhaps, that the teenage angst was behind me.\n\nBut for the past two months I can feel it coming back in waves. This time I'm much better aware of my feelings than I was 9 years back. But at the same time I feel so helpless knowing I'm doomed to be miserable no matter what I do. \n\nAll my life I have been the weird kid. When I'm okay I feel secure enough to handle those comments with a sense of humour. But when I'm feeling weird myself and beating up myself for feeling the way I do, hearing someone else say it really hurts. \n\nI wish I could open up to my friends (from whom most of these comments are from) but I know that won't help. Their attitude is like you need a reason to be sad....like family, financial problems etc. I feel if I had a reason for feeling so dark and down it wouldn't be a damn illness. Sadness is a completely normal emotion to feel when things are shit. It's when you can't help going down that spiral for something so apparently petty, when you know that you're spiraling into a dark, unhealthy place but can't stop it, that it becomes a illness.\n\nAnyway I just needed to share it with someone. If anyone read it, thank you for your patience.",

I've been taking medication for quite a while but things just seem to get worse and I feel like I'm a burden to my friends. This year was one of the worst years of my life and the thing is nothing special really happened. I often feel like I'm not doing anything with my life, like I'm wasting it thinking about things that don't matter or just not living enough. Saying to myself I can't really do stuff. I'm in my second year of college and often I feel like  it was one of the worst decisions of my life. Because I don't feel like I'm learning anything, the system is entirely corrupted by the capitalist ideology of learning under pressure, having grades that will ultimately define you without any regard for the other aspects of your existence. It's the only thing that matters: grades, a good job and a couple of money to make the system move on. I feel like my relationship with people in many aspects has been declining in consequence of my stress with college. I've been noticing that my anxiety is getting worse when talking to older or new people. I'm not reading my books, or watching my series or films because college life just seems to consume me completely. And it's not as if I was studying a lot because most of the time I'm just sleeping 10hours a day to not do anything or just listen to music and cry instead of being productive as I should. I feel my life is terrible but it's not exactly bad: it's just empty and meaningless. There are days in which something good happens and I meet a couple of people from college and I feel completed, not alone, identified even, but most of the time loneliness just hits me so strongly. And when that happens I just don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel the friends I made when I moved in (my real only friends) are just so not similar with me in terms of taste and interests that I just feel like that they're not my people to the point of feeling judged by them even. I don't know. I really don't fucking know. Other thing that has been haunting me for a long time is the fact that I'm always falling in love. Always. I think I'm always doing that because I feel like I've never experienced true reciprocity so I just end up loving someone to feel something. Maybe I just have too much love tied up and really need to release it. Maybe I'm expecting something that won't come. Maybe I have so many traumatic experiences with rejection that  whenever I fall in love I just hide away in order not to feel hurt again. So I just love silently and painfully knowing that nothing will ever happen because I can't speak, I can't move. I've spent all my life being the secondary character of my own movie and I don't know best. The only time I felt special was when I wasn't loving and was using another person to feel that. So I'm just useless. All I wanted to do was to stop my life for a couple of weeks and just process things, realize what I have to do because I'm so fucking lost rn.",

         "selftext": "This\u2019ll be a very long and personal story, but I\u2019m at a loss, very afraid and considerably embarrassed about my circumstances. This is my first Reddit post too. \n\nAbout six years ago I went to college. For a lot of reasons I decided to travel across the country, to what I thought was one of the best writing schools in the U.S. I was always a promising student in high school. A busy body. I would compete in academic competitions and won state and national awards. I won \u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d as a Senior. I left my home state in the South and went to the North East on scholarship. I was supposed to be somebody. \n\nThen, my sophomore year, I realized college wasn\u2019t what I thought it could\u2019ve been and my school really wasn\u2019t for me, but I hadn\u2019t done well my first year academically and felt trapped. I could\u2019ve transferred but it would\u2019ve been a failure to myself. I came off a breakup with a boy who felt like, for a long time, my forever love, and that and the school environment really kickstarted the worst years of the depression.  I had no self worth and started smoking pot regularly. I was assaulted my freshman year and began to feel incredibly alone in the NE winters. My friends were largely fake friends, I didn\u2019t find my people until late in the game. The school population was largely rich kids I didn\u2019t know how to fit in with. Everything was wrong, but I couldn\u2019t get myself to value myself enough or be vulnerable enough to say \u201chey, I chose wrong, this isn\u2019t for me, let\u2019s try something different.\u201d \n\nMy mom, a single mom, didn\u2019t finish college and didn\u2019t know how to help me from so far away, so I pushed her, and all my family, because I was so embarrassed I was failing the high expectations I put on myself. My home life, a broken home, where I was never happy and the kid who was good in school but never fit in, had a lot behind why I chose to go to school so far away. I became a recluse. \n\nI joined organizations I would have been the head of in high school, but I dropped all of them. I switched majors twice because I couldn\u2019t find my fit. I entered pyschosis and detached from reality (which is a whole set of other stories). I felt so much pressure to succeed and couldn\u2019t deliver; this was supposed to be my shot and I instead left with a pure hatred of my university, depression, PTSD and debilitating anxiety. (The anxiety got so bad I couldn\u2019t even choose socks one morning. I burst into tears as my brain frenzied, and laid on my bed instead of going to class, because I couldn\u2019t PICK SOCKS.) I had a broken heart, little family connections, a lingering feeling I was killing myself, then, my father figure died. \n\nI entered into therapy to deal with childhood trauma and that was largely how I spent my last two years of college. I went on and off meds. I\u2019ve tried to tell myself this is good. This was work I needed to do and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done it if the circumstances had been different, but I\u2019m home now and it\u2019s been over a year and I\u2019m back in food service and feel like a failure. I wonder about what people say about me (the girl who maybe to them naively thought she was going to be somebody).

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This\u2019ll be a very long and personal story, but I\u2019m at a loss, very afraid and considerably embarrassed about my circumstances. This is my first Reddit post too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About six years ago I went to college. For a lot of reasons I decided to travel across the country, to what I thought was one of the best writing schools in the U.S. I was always a promising student in high school. A busy body. I would compete in academic competitions and won state and national awards. I won \u201cMost Likely to Succeed\u201d as a Senior. I left my home state in the South and went to the North East on scholarship. I was supposed to be somebody. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, my sophomore year, I realized college wasn\u2019t what I thought it could\u2019ve been and my school really wasn\u2019t for me, but I hadn\u2019t done well my first year academically and felt trapped. I could\u2019ve transferred but it would\u2019ve been a failure to myself. I came off a breakup with a boy who felt like, for a long time, my forever love, and that and the school environment really kickstarted the worst years of the depression.  I had no self worth and started smoking pot regularly. I was assaulted my freshman year and began to feel incredibly alone in the NE winters. My friends were largely fake friends, I didn\u2019t find my people until late in the game. The school population was largely rich kids I didn\u2019t know how to fit in with. Everything was wrong, but I couldn\u2019t get myself to value myself enough or be vulnerable enough to say \u201chey, I chose wrong, this isn\u2019t for me, let\u2019s try something different.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom, a single mom, didn\u2019t finish college and didn\u2019t know how to help me from so far away, so I pushed her, and all my family, because I was so embarrassed I was failing the high expectations I put on myself. My home life, a broken home, where I was never happy and the kid who was good in school but never fit in, had a lot behind why I chose to go to school so far away. I became a recluse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I joined organizations I would have been the head of in high school, but I dropped all of them. I switched majors twice because I couldn\u2019t find my fit. I entered pyschosis and detached from reality (which is a whole set of other stories). I felt so much pressure to succeed and couldn\u2019t deliver; this was supposed to be my shot and I instead left with a pure hatred of my university, depression, PTSD and debilitating anxiety. (The anxiety got so bad I couldn\u2019t even choose socks one morning. I burst into tears as my brain frenzied, and laid on my bed instead of going to class, because I couldn\u2019t PICK SOCKS.) I had a broken heart, little family connections, a lingering feeling I was killing myself, then, my father figure died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered into therapy to deal with childhood trauma and that was largely how I spent my last two years of college. I went on and off meds. I\u2019ve tried to tell myself this is good. This was work I needed to do and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done it if the circumstances had been different, but I\u2019m home now and it\u2019s been over a year and I\u2019m back in food service and feel like a failure. I wonder about what people say about me (the girl who maybe to them naively thought she was going to be somebody). I have my depression, anxiety and PTSD largely under control, and I feel possibly the most secure in myself I ever have, but I just feel so lost. I should\u2019ve been someone, and I wasn\u2019t. I missed my shot. That\u2019s how I feel. Now I\u2019m too broke for therapy and after so many years out of the game (I\u2019m a writer who stopped writing because of all the bs) I don\u2019t know how to get back in. I\u2019m young, so maybe I\u2019m naively hopeful, but I\u2019m just so sad.

         "selftext": "I can't shake off this horrible feeling that my depression will never truly go away. Sure, I have some days that are better than others, but it's always there in the back of my mind, sending me thoughts that it would be better off for everyone else that I would be dead. It follows me ever so closely, like a shadow draining my will to live with every passing day. For me personally, a reason I struggle a lot is down to social anxiety. I worry and fear about near enough everything, especially if it involves going outside. Even today going out to vote in the UK election made me nervous which is simply absurd really, but I forced myself to do it because I would have felt guilty had I not done. I am 28 years old.\n\nI've always been more of the introverted type growing up, even at school, I only had a real close group of friends and rarely ventured out of that particular social circle. Shutting myself inside playing video games for many years and making excuses not to go out has most likely messed me up psychologically as well. They have always acted as an escapism tool for me but I don't really enjoy them like I used to when I was younger, it seems I'm now much more self-aware when I play them and I know deep down I'm using them to run away from my problems and responsibilities. I don't do drugs, smoke, or drink much so gaming is my crutch. Most people in this world have a crutch of sorts to keep them going or to get away from something they would rather not face up to.\n\nThe sad truth is I feel the most comfortable when I'm around our cat and my parents more than anyone else. If our cat died (and I know he won't live forever), it would break me 100% with how poor my mental health is now. When you have depression, even brushing your teeth feels like a massive task (but please do, it's important) and I wish I had the same drive and motivation normal people do. I have no idea where they get it from. Finding interest in anything is difficult. There's so much I could have achieved this year but I feel like I've wasted it all yet again. The only positive I can find is that it can hopefully only get better because having no job or friends means I'm pretty much at rock bottom already (and yes, I am a virgin obviously). I'm thankful I have such loving parents that care about me, my dad in particular spoils me and is protective, but maybe he could tone it down at times. I should have been more independant at a younger age.\n\nLastly, I've always wondered if I might have aspergers or not. I am quite shy, but that could just be social anxiety. I can sometimes struggle with eye contact but that again could simply be a lack of confidence and shyness. I have socialised well in the past, ever since my depression started up, it's affected my mind and thought processes in a bad way so I believe that could be the main cause why I don't put myself out there anymore. It's not like every introvert on the planet is autistic after all, but I have to admit that possibly being on the spectrum has crossed my mind a couple of times. Maybe I'm scared to get myself checked out if I am being honest. Hope everyone is doing ok.\n\n#",

         "selftext": "Hey Redditers, I've been lurking here for quite a while but now I feel it is time to let something out to whom it might be worth reading.\n\nI would like to apologize for errors in my English, I live in the Netherlands so English is my second language.\n\nI come from a family suffering from depression, the side of my father all struggle with this illness in some way or another. My sister struggles with it, I struggle with it. Compared to my family I dodged the bullet, my depression can take me by surprise for certain periods, but it is not as 'bad' or 'present' as with the rest of my family.\n\nAround the time I was 16 my father told me he couldn't handle it anymore and wanted to commit suicide. I told him the same hurtfull words that I have heard multiple times: 'Just sleep on it or do something nice, it will go away'. Luckily my father is still around to this day.\n\nAround ten years later I found out that the way i was feeling, the way my own head was punishing me for everything i did, say or think wasn't 'normal'. I always thought this was the way everyone was feeling and was often surprised by the fact how people could just continue with their lives day after day like nothing held them back. I was told by my therapist i suffered from depression, just like the rest of my family, and that this wasn't something everybody around me lived with. It was a relief knowing that not everyone around me felt this way. But is was hard to accept that i felt this way... why me?\n\nYears passed, and i started to recognise my depression more and i was able to fight against it. I started to recognise the shadow lurking by my side telling me i couldn't do stuff, was worthless, unlikeable. There are days I can tell my shadow to sodd off, there are days he overshadows me. But all this time I am fighting, and I continue to fight knowing this is possible.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, i was told my father has cancer. Today i will be driving him to the hospital, tomorrow he will have his bladder and prostate removed, hoping that will stop the cancer spreading.\n\nThis made my shadow stronger, but knowning i can fight it still gives me the energy to overcome him.\n\nThree weeks ago, i was told my uncle (suffering from depression his whole life) has taken his own life, he wrote a letter and took all his anti depressants at once. He was 62 years old. This hit me real hard, and you can image, my father being the older brother, is devastated.\n\nThese are the days my shadow is stronger than ever, the fight becomes more troubling and more intense. My fight with my shadow was something i thought that was possible. But seeing my uncle, losing the fight after 62 years. Is it truly possible? After 62 years of fighting, thinking: no more.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, coming from a family living with depression I am quite used to it. But this is the first one of us to succumb under the pressure and it makes me scared for the future. I am 32, am i able to continue this fight for more than 30 years?\n\nThank you for reading, typing this has made me feel a bit better. If someone has experience with coping with something like this please let me know. Or if you're just curious about things, ask me anything.\n\nThanks.",

I didn't want to do therapy because I didn't think it would help and I have social anxiety, new people scare me, even if they are meant to help, I would feel like the therapist would think I was a fraud or something. \n\nLast year I found out I could do therapy online via messaging so I figured I would give it a go and I did it for 6 months. I was doing CBT and it just didn't work. I agreed with pretty much all of what the therapist said, vicious circles and negative thoughts etc but despite that I cant help the way my brain works and it just didn't make a difference to how I felt. I also hated that they would basically give me homework \"keep a diary of these thoughts for our next session/read this/fill out this flow chart\", I can't motivate myself to do the things that I want to do, so motivating myself to do homework that I feel is pointless was not going to happen. \n\nI stopped the therapy after 8 months and haven't done anything about it since. Is it worth me going back to my Doctor and asking about anti-depressants again? I just want to be able to motivate myself to actually do things I want to move forward in my life instead of just being stuck, will anti-depressants help with this?",

I also hated that they would basically give me homework &amp;quot;keep a diary of these thoughts for our next session/read this/fill out this flow chart&amp;quot;, I can&amp;#39;t motivate myself to do the things that I want to do, so motivating myself to do homework that I feel is pointless was not going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped the therapy after 8 months and haven&amp;#39;t done anything about it since. Is it worth me going back to my Doctor and asking about anti-depressants again? I just want to be able to motivate myself to actually do things I want to move forward in my life instead of just being stuck, will anti-depressants help with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The bills exceed what I can reasonably make. On top of that, I&amp;#39;m not even feeling much better from the treatment I&amp;#39;ve gotten. I&amp;#39;m plagued with suicidal thoughts, touch starved and alone, my few friends pretty much just ignore me if I ask for help. I didn&amp;#39;t get out of bed once today, just slept and cried. I figure if my situation hasn&amp;#39;t improved by the time I&amp;#39;m almost out of money a few months from now, I&amp;#39;m just gonna off myself. I don&amp;#39;t know how yet, but I&amp;#39;ll find a way. My life is in shambles. I can&amp;#39;t keep doing this. I have nobody I can turn to and I&amp;#39;m really scared. I don&amp;#39;t want to die, but it&amp;#39;s getting increasingly clear that that&amp;#39;s the only way I&amp;#39;m gonna be able to escape this hell. I&amp;#39;m miserable. I don&amp;#39;t see any way I&amp;#39;m ever going to get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "I don't want to think I've been depressed, but  I think I have been. It's something I really only came to terms with over the summer, though. __I am well aware that this sub-reddit, or anywhere on the internet for that matter, is not a place to be diagnosed,__ but I just don't understand why I have been the way I've been. I want to know how to stop it.\n \n \n\nIt's been two to three years of this shit:\n \n\u2022 In my first year of university especially, I stopped talking to most of my friends or actively avoided them either because I was so scared of dragging them down with me or because I didn't feel like I was worthy of even talking to them. The latter of which made it hard for me to also make friends. It hurts that I want to be there for the people I care about, but I'm just not capable of giving the best I can right now.\n\n\u2022 My grades dropped before I even went to university. I was a straight-A student up until grade 11, but gradually in the span of like five months during my senior year, I went from averaging 80s-90s to 50s-60s. Needless to say, university has been an absolute shit show, hah.\n\n\u2022 I hate how disgusting this is as well but god, I procrastinated all the shit in my life that it affected my personal hygiene too... the worst was going like almost a whole week without showering, and that's just because, at the time, I had no reason to leave the house. I would've showered if I did. Hell, I distinctly remember justifying it as something along the lines of: \"I don't deserve fresh water.\" Like it's only months later with shining clarity that I remember I'm human too and that clean water is a basic human right, isn't it? Not only for drinking...\n\n\u2022 I don't know if this is related either, but I don't feel pain in my stomach when I'm hungry anymore, it just crops up as a really bad tension headache that won't go away until I've sufficiently eaten?\n\n\u2022 But, you know, mentally? It's so hard for me to stay focused on anything too. When it gets bad: the harder I tried to focus on what someone was saying, the faster their words would go in one ear and out the other. I used to be amazing with names and birthdays, but now it takes me like three times of meeting the same person for it to stick. I imagine this is what being ninety might be like if I don't practice sudoku faithfully.\n \n \nAnyway, funny thing is that I was mostly motivated by being tired OF being tired of pulling the same shit and stressing over the same shit.\n \n \nSo you know what, for the past few months, I've tried. I've already tried getting more sleep-- hell, my grades have been affected because I prioritized sleep. I always try to drink enough water because my brain feels like it'll eject itself through my eye sockets if I don't. When the weather was better, I tried walking/running/biking outside when I could-- though not routinely. Very important as well: I made sure that I never went more than two or three days without showering. Long since deleted this one social media app that really stole my time too. I've even made some new friends, one who I really did click with; I also got in contact with people I lost touch with. I submitted most of my assignments on time, instead of handing it in at 11:59 PM seven days after it was due or just not handing in anything at all; but it's mostly because I'm on Academic Probation. I took up a new hobby which is really just trying to learn one whole song on the piano.\n \n \nThere have been times where I lapsed in several of those, of course... but just especially in the past few weeks because of end-of-term burnout and exams.\n \n \nI'm still proud of myself and yet, I still don't feel any different. What will it fucking take for me to be able to *truly* be there for the people I care about? How much longer will it be until I feel like I have my shit together? I still have a hard time focusing on anything unless it's urgent or even overdue. It's still hard for me to listen to what someone says because I zone out without realizing. I can't bring myself to care about things I should, and that makes me feel overwhelming guilt instead. Also a typical thing, but you know what, it's been devastating that even the music or any media I used to love cannot make me feel much anymore.\n \n\nYeah, I don't know, I read the rules. I feel like I need both support and some advice, I guess????? Should I have gone on the motivation/getting_over_it sub-reddits? Motivation doesn't really last me much and not for long either, and half of what I need could come from this sub instead of getting_over_it (should I cross-post then?).\n \n \n\nHow can I be more patient with myself? How can I be less frustrated with myself? How can I better discipline myself? Should I even go and see a psychiatrist? It isn't even that bad anymore? Is this just teenage angst?\n \n \n\nIdk who's going to take the time to skim, let alone read, but thank you for your time. I'm sorry it's long, but I just needed to get all of this out.",

Long story short, I went to elementary school without being able to speak in my native tongue. Fellow peers disliked the fact that I couldn't understand a word they said and they bullied me and ostracized me for always being that one weird kid and also for always being sad because I had no one to play with. Every day I would lock myself in my room and cry myself to sleep, asking myself if I will ever be happy. And I think at that moment that was when the panic attacks came the first time around. I always thought that crying until you were gasping for air until you feel close to death was somewhat normal , until I read that people rarely cry while hyperventilating (my family has a history of having asthma so I thought it was related to it).\n\nI guess I somewhat survived those panic attacks and depressive episodes by working myself to the bone. I never had time to think for myself. My dad hates it when I cry, and my mom thinks I can get over it by trying to better myself, so she set expectations on me, like graduate high school as one of the best, getting into a prestigious college, have at least a 3.5 GPA. So I tried fulfilling her expectations. I had no time to properly process my feelings, and when I needed to do so (like when someone close to me died, or I failed to get into my dream high school, finding out my passion) I just don't. I let everything pass me by. I never told any of my friends about what was going on in my life. I didn't go through that puberty phase of finding out who I am, what I want to be, because for me at that time it was useless. I was pretty sure that by what my mother said, it didn't matter if I had dreams or not. How many people manage to make their dreams come true anyway ? As long as I graduate college top of the class, job offers would come rolling in, i would work a 9 to 5 job, save up enough money to get married and have a family of my own and I didn't need to think more on my life.\n\nUntil lately, on my last year of college, I always felt extremely tired. Whenever something stressful came up like exams I feel like vomiting and wishing that time would just stop, and panic attacks would come back more frequently and it gets harder every time to hold it back. I felt nauseous all the time, like I was feeling something but I couldn't identify what the feeling was. I didn't know if it was sadness, anger, regret, happiness, or anything really. That was when I went to my psychologist and got diagnosed. I was burnt out with my college, my hobbies, I was tired of fulfilling my moms expectations which seems like it was never ending. I even tried ending my life at one point. So I decided this semester I should take a break. With almost nothing to do and nothing to motivate me, I honestly don't know why I should keep on living at this point.\n\nI just waste away my time on the computer, sometimes I feel sad for no reason, and I try my best to ignore my excessive need to sleep. I've been trying to get into hobbies like singing and playing violin, started working out even. But part of me wonders, what is it that I'm trying to do ? Why am I trying so hard to stay alive when there isn't much to look forward to in my everyday life ? Do I get to be happy again ? Who am I doing this for ? What will all of this amount of effort amount to ? I feel bored and tired everyday and it gets harder to wake up, I just feel like If I had a reason to keep on living, it would be easier to try and heal myself from depression.",

One friend from those days asked me to be one of his groomsmen to which I said yes. Of course, while I liked him, that means I'll see other people from my past that I moved on from. They are from a fraternity and while I wasn't the best member, I also didn't fit into it much. As I write this, I kind of already have my answer to what I needed and wanted to vent. The Bachelor party and other events that will be planned. I don't want to attend what I don't feel comfortable being a part of when I never connected with many of the guys there.\n    I get that once you ruin your own reputation by things you did or that happen to you, well, at some point you have to own up to that and face the ugly truth. You are and were a part of that, quite as much as others may have been, too. That also means the version others create of you may still be stuck in the past, as well, and they will make fun of you for it or even look down upon you for it even if the years went on without them near or by your side. In any case, for years I let my past have power over me, affect how I isolate myself or don't trust others easily and it sucks. These past few months I finally acknowledged I needed help and got the courage to explore different resources in part because of this past of which I share responsibility without a doubt.\n     I guess I just dont know why I said yes to being this friends groomsmen when I didnt get along too well with my fraternity from younger days. I respected him. I also don't want this part of my past to have power over me as I'm trying to just move the fuck on and focus on a better future that sometimes still gets clouded with doubt and lowers the confidence I've been trying to build in myself. It's a work in progress. Has it been better yes. But like tonight, some bad memories bring back the emotion, pain, and what have you as though it almost never left. In any case, I'm just trying to be a better person coping with part of my mental health of depression stemming from some trauma. It just sucks when it's not something you can open up easily about and even if you were to, not that I want them to care, just to try and understand and let by gones be by gones. The past shouldn't define you if it is something you are trying to grow from.\n\nSorry if it's all vague. I just wanted to vent after waking up randomly thinking about it.",

I hate myself for the products i buy, despite knowing of their reprehensible origins. I hate myself for not trying to improve anymore, instead avoiding life alltogether. I hate myself because i always did and i dont know any different. \n\nIve been diagnosed and treated for depression, anxiety disorder and ADHD but not a single pill or thought experiment a therapist would have me try had any significant impact on my wellbeing in any way.\n\nIm tired of being nothing but hate.

         "selftext": "So a friend of mine, an online friend who I have met irl last summer from a different country to me, almost committed suicide last night. I was in a voice call with him earlier that evening and he said he was frustrated with a friend he goes to school with because he wouldn\u2019t tell him what was going on with him. I told him he didn\u2019t have control over that and that he can only do so much to help. And then I went for a shower, so I didn\u2019t hear from him in a while. Until I got this message from him where he called himself a coward.\n\nHe kept apologizing and honestly I\u2019ve never really seen himself like this before. I was so scared for him, he told me he was on the roof. I called him. Luckily he picked up. He sounded really upset. He called himself a coward because he didn\u2019t have the courage to jump. I spent a good two hours that night talking him down, making sure he knew how much I value him as my friend and how much his other online friends love him too (we\u2019re all in a tight little community). \n\nIt got to the point where he realized he wasn\u2019t sure why he was upset anymore, because all of his friendships and relationships (apart from this one guy) are all going well for him.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a friend of mine, an online friend who I have met irl last summer from a different country to me, almost committed suicide last night. I was in a voice call with him earlier that evening and he said he was frustrated with a friend he goes to school with because he wouldn\u2019t tell him what was going on with him. I told him he didn\u2019t have control over that and that he can only do so much to help. And then I went for a shower, so I didn\u2019t hear from him in a while. Until I got this message from him where he called himself a coward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept apologizing and honestly I\u2019ve never really seen himself like this before. I was so scared for him, he told me he was on the roof. I called him. Luckily he picked up. He sounded really upset. He called himself a coward because he didn\u2019t have the courage to jump. I spent a good two hours that night talking him down, making sure he knew how much I value him as my friend and how much his other online friends love him too (we\u2019re all in a tight little community). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where he realized he wasn\u2019t sure why he was upset anymore, because all of his friendships and relationships (apart from this one guy) are all going well for him. I knew he was depressed but I never thought he would get to the attempted stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continuously apologized for worrying me and any of our friends, and he admitted that there were some friends he made sure not to tell because he knew that they were quite unstable too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that between me and the thought of his girlfriend, we were both probably the reason why he\u2019s still alive.

         "selftext": "My therapist said this to me during our first session. She was right. My god, was she right. \n\nI've spent my entire adult life in a cycle of running from my depression. From my trauma. From my past. Because it is easier to start a new job every 6 months, to find a new distraction, than to face history. At almost 30 years old, I've decided that I'm done running from it. Now I have two decades worth of trauma and suppressed emotions to unpack and sift through, and I've never felt so weak. \n\nI can't count a day in the last month that I haven't cried, and most of the time I don't even know why I'm fucking crying. Before this, I can't remember the last time I did cry. I go to my therapy sessions religiously even though I know the devastation they are going to release on my life for the rest of the week. It's a good week if I make it to work 4 out of 5 days. Fuck, it's a good week if I can confidently say I've showered in the last 7 days. \n\nI had a panic attack Sunday. The aftermath meant I didn't go to work Monday or Tuesday. The only reason I went today is because I couldn't handle anymore disappoint in myself. I had to make that voice shut up, at least for a few hours. My therapy session wasn't bad, per se. But it's the fucking aftermath. It's the laying in bed 20 minutes before my husband is supposed to be on shift, bawling like a child to him about... what? What am I even crying about? About how much easier it was to just avoid this. About how frustrated I am that I'm so sensitive now, that everything makes me cry.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My therapist said this to me during our first session. She was right. My god, was she right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent my entire adult life in a cycle of running from my depression. From my trauma. From my past. Because it is easier to start a new job every 6 months, to find a new distraction, than to face history. At almost 30 years old, I&amp;#39;ve decided that I&amp;#39;m done running from it. Now I have two decades worth of trauma and suppressed emotions to unpack and sift through, and I&amp;#39;ve never felt so weak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t count a day in the last month that I haven&amp;#39;t cried, and most of the time I don&amp;#39;t even know why I&amp;#39;m fucking crying. Before this, I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time I did cry. I go to my therapy sessions religiously even though I know the devastation they are going to release on my life for the rest of the week. It&amp;#39;s a good week if I make it to work 4 out of 5 days. Fuck, it&amp;#39;s a good week if I can confidently say I&amp;#39;ve showered in the last 7 days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a panic attack Sunday. The aftermath meant I didn&amp;#39;t go to work Monday or Tuesday. The only reason I went today is because I couldn&amp;#39;t handle anymore disappoint in myself. I had to make that voice shut up, at least for a few hours. My therapy session wasn&amp;#39;t bad, per se. But it&amp;#39;s the fucking aftermath. It&amp;#39;s the laying in bed 20 minutes before my husband is supposed to be on shift, bawling like a child to him about... what? What am I even crying about? About how much easier it was to just avoid this. About how frustrated I am that I&amp;#39;m so sensitive now, that everything makes me cry. About how heavy the weight is when I don&amp;#39;t know why I can&amp;#39;t get up, I just can&amp;#39;t and I hate myself even more for not being able to.

The white dots are my moments of reprieve, solace, joy and contentment. But they\u2019re all juxtaposed against an all-enveloping wall of black paint; the depression. Always there. Always looming behind those moments of safety, waiting for the slightest crack in the facade to unleash its assault on my psyche once again. \n\nI think of the wealthy people, the famous people, those beloved by millions, who have committed suicide.

I have nothing compared to them, how can anyone expect me to survive this? \n\nI don\u2019t see a future where I\u2019m happy. I don\u2019t see a future, period.

So why is there such a violent struggle inside me between happiness and misery? And why is misery winning? \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.

I won\u2019t ever get better even with the medicine. I\u2019m sorry, mom and dad. I hope you never have to read these words. \n\nAll my life I wanted to be someone worth remembering; a name people would share for generations.

I know why I'm depressed and it makes me so angry. I am afraid of the future and I don't feel capable. It is so tiring every day to think that death is the only solution.

The last few months have been great, I have been motivated, waking up early every morning, eating, reading and things were great. Nov 25th two of my friends died in a tragic car accident and I\u2019ve been very heart broken and been dealing with the grief. On Dec 1st my god father died and that\u2019s been a hard pill to swallow but I\u2019ve been carrying on. \n\nToday my aunt Betty (dad\u2019s sister) sent me a message via Facebook saying:  \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to inform you but Aunty Ruth died last night in her sleep. Please call your father and tell him the sad news.\u201d (My father does not have a cell phone or computer, but a landline)\n\nI was so surprised I didn\u2019t know what to do, I loved my aunt Ruth with all my heart, and I knew my father would be heartbroken so with shaking hands I called him and told him the sad news that his sister passed away. We cried and talked about life and death, and had a very long heart to heart. He asked for more information so I hung up and called aunt Betty for the details. \n\nAs she was explaining things to me some things didn\u2019t seem to be adding up right. Betty was saying stuff like: \u201cI know she was tired of the nursing home anyways, at least she\u2019s with her husband now.\u201d Which weren\u2019t making sense. Ruthie never had a husband, and as far as I knew she wasn\u2019t in a nursing home. \nSo finally I asked her when she was put in a home and when did she get married??\n\nThen the line got silent and I heard: \u201cOh my god. You think I\u2019m talking about YOUR aunt Ruthie!\u201d\n\nApparently, unbeknown to me, my dad had an aunty named Ruth (as well as a sister named Ruth) that I had no idea about. And that\u2019s who passed away. So I had to call back my dad and explain quickly the entire mixup. He was relieved to say the least, but I damn near gave my poor daddy a heart attack and now I\u2019m trying to process everything that just happened. \n\nFor some reason this had been the cherry on top of the cake and I feel so low and down.

         "selftext": "Well I am another year older in my 30s and if kid me saw where I am in life then he would probably be even more depressed then I was.  I have a well paying job, nice things, yet I am not happy.  It is really not a happy birthday.  It hasnt been for years.\n\nIf it wasn't for my parents and my brother I would be totally alone.  I have essentially no friends since they have all moved on, started families, and made new \"parent\" friends.  I haven't had a girlfriend in over a year and that relationship lasted 2 months.  I have yet to have a relationship last more than half a year.  Everyone just leaves me.  Lets not even go down the online dating conversation as I have been doing that since my 20s and had maybe dates with 6 different girls.  Thats after redoing pictures, my profile, thinking of writing thoughtful messages, etc.   The amount of time I have spent for that little reward is asinine.\n\nEven though I am only in my mid 30s, I am bitter as hell.  I hate people my own age and see them as users and having no empathy for me.  I hate women as the whole no relationship issue makes me feel unloved and broken.

YOU CAN NOT force people to like you or want to spend time with you.\n2. People say to keep at it and give generic advice take the easy way out and dont really care to help you.\n3. Online dating is a total ego killer and makes people super bitter.\n4. There are a lot of people out there like me and I hate when people used that as an excuse why I shouldn't feel bad.\n5. I am getting too old and bitter to continue to play games with people when it comes to relationships.\n6. I will most likely be alone forever.\n\nWell, sorry for the rant.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I am another year older in my 30s and if kid me saw where I am in life then he would probably be even more depressed then I was.  I have a well paying job, nice things, yet I am not happy.  It is really not a happy birthday.  It hasnt been for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&amp;#39;t for my parents and my brother I would be totally alone.  I have essentially no friends since they have all moved on, started families, and made new &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; friends.  I haven&amp;#39;t had a girlfriend in over a year and that relationship lasted 2 months.  I have yet to have a relationship last more than half a year.  Everyone just leaves me.  Lets not even go down the online dating conversation as I have been doing that since my 20s and had maybe dates with 6 different girls.  Thats after redoing pictures, my profile, thinking of writing thoughtful messages, etc.   The amount of time I have spent for that little reward is asinine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I am only in my mid 30s, I am bitter as hell.  I hate people my own age and see them as users and having no empathy for me.  I hate women as the whole no relationship issue makes me feel unloved and broken.

I decided to move away from Bettas just because I don't like having lonely fish and got some mollies. The mollies ended up being kind of aggressive towards one another: one died and I separated the remaining two. One of those two died and the one I had left is always hangry. It's rather sweet how she comes up to the glass by the food cup and wiggles, or starts gulping to indicate that she wants more food. She unexpectedly had babies recently and caring for them has been stressful (I've also killed some of those too and I already feel terrible about it). So basically I am terrible at caring for fish and somehow managed to get ten more without lifting a finger.  Interacting with my fish does make me feel a little better sometimes, but it's not the same as having a cat or dog ask you for scritches, suddenly pop up on your lap, or play with a toy. \n\nI also have a dog sometimes, but I share her with my mom. My mom likes to put me down and criticise the way I care for her or accuse me of making her sick when's she's healthy. Obviously I love my dog, we've had her since I was a kid and I grew up calling her my sister. She's very affectionate and always loves pets, but she also has bad separation anxiety and it can be hard to accommodate her and guests. People don't understand that you *have* to greet her (meaning; extensive scritches and pets) before she stops trying to get your attention.

She always tells me that it's not true and that she loves me but I don't know if it's true. I always think that she is with me because she knows that if she would leave me I will kill myself for sure and she doesn't want that. She always tells me that whenever I feel suicidal I can hit her up and talk and usually I do but whenever I leave that message that I'm falling apart (again) and I will try to kill myself that night she just leaves me on seen and that's it. I don't know if it's on purpose or not but it hurts me. But at the same time I can't hate her. I wouldn't want to listen to all my shits on a daily basis and I would ignore myself too. Hell, I wanna leave myself. And maybe I will. I don't want this relationship to be one sided like all my previous relationships. All I've ever done is that I love everyone by my heart and they are my first choice but all I've ever recived is ignorance and no one needs me and I'm always the last choice to talk to, to call.

My depression, my 3 suicide attempts, my anxiety, my social anxiety, my insecurity. We get along pretty well but I feel like I&amp;#39;m scaring her away. She always tells me that it&amp;#39;s not true and that she loves me but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s true. I always think that she is with me because she knows that if she would leave me I will kill myself for sure and she doesn&amp;#39;t want that. She always tells me that whenever I feel suicidal I can hit her up and talk and usually I do but whenever I leave that message that I&amp;#39;m falling apart (again) and I will try to kill myself that night she just leaves me on seen and that&amp;#39;s it. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s on purpose or not but it hurts me. But at the same time I can&amp;#39;t hate her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to listen to all my shits on a daily basis and I would ignore myself too. Hell, I wanna leave myself. And maybe I will. I don&amp;#39;t want this relationship to be one sided like all my previous relationships. All I&amp;#39;ve ever done is that I love everyone by my heart and they are my first choice but all I&amp;#39;ve ever recived is ignorance and no one needs me and I&amp;#39;m always the last choice to talk to, to call. I don&amp;#39;t want my life anymore. I just wanna leave forever&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Or is it us consumers that thoughtlessly buy things or demand everything be cheaper, even if it kills people. Or the fact that we continue on day by day with climate change right in our faces. Or is it that supermarkets ban plastic bags and restaurants use paper straws so everyone thinks \"ooh I'm doing my part\". Or even the fact that now the supermarkets have got rid of plastic bags, everyone buying up paper bags (larger carbon footprint than plastic bags) or the fabric ones made by who? Probably fucking children. Everyone is always fucking stepping over everyone to get their own way. Everyone's just out to fuck over who they can, as long as they get ahead. Equality is so hilariously far away, whether you're looking at gender equality, pay equality and wealth distribution, racial equality or any sort of way that one person is getting a better bargain than another. And everyone says to me \"oh but that's just life\". Nah FUCK THAT. That's just life because we allow it to fucking be life. Why aren't people more worried about shit.

From the capitalist pigs who drive children into cobalt mines in the Congo to sweatshops in Bangladesh. Or is it us consumers that thoughtlessly buy things or demand everything be cheaper, even if it kills people. Or the fact that we continue on day by day with climate change right in our faces. Or is it that supermarkets ban plastic bags and restaurants use paper straws so everyone thinks &amp;quot;ooh I&amp;#39;m doing my part&amp;quot;. Or even the fact that now the supermarkets have got rid of plastic bags, everyone buying up paper bags (larger carbon footprint than plastic bags) or the fabric ones made by who? Probably fucking children. Everyone is always fucking stepping over everyone to get their own way. Everyone&amp;#39;s just out to fuck over who they can, as long as they get ahead. Equality is so hilariously far away, whether you&amp;#39;re looking at gender equality, pay equality and wealth distribution, racial equality or any sort of way that one person is getting a better bargain than another. And everyone says to me &amp;quot;oh but that&amp;#39;s just life&amp;quot;. Nah FUCK THAT. That&amp;#39;s just life because we allow it to fucking be life.

The idea was so normal in my head that I just said it like any other answer, unaware of what the fuck was wrong. I didn't even really say it, it just happened. Of course, she asks what I mean, and I play it off. I'm fucking good at the whole \"faking\" thing. \n\nTrying to find the reason why I should care, why I'm worthy of existing, and why I should even want to get better is hard. I still don't get it. I don't understand why people care about me, I don't understand why I should care about me. I don't understand the point in living when everything that makes it worth living is gone.

He doesn't do anything unless I specifically ask him first. He won't say \"I love you\" unless I say it first and most of the time he doesn't even say it back.

Met a woman in tinder and had a good first date, had my depression tell me she'd reject me and my head tell me to ask anyway.\n\nI did ask for a second date and she did say no. She was concerned because I am only seperated not divorced, but she has no problem being friends. I won't lie I am a little disapointed but I may have too much of a crush on her. A beautiful woman that I know is out of my league willing to talk to me gives me hope. \n\nIt's funny that as much as I wish she would have said yes I am actually fine with her no. I'm still going to talk with her to get to know her. I figure I have no downside here. I make a new friend or I make a new friend that could build into a relationship. \n\nI beat the lies that my depression told me. She is ok with me as a person, as a friend and I should be ok with myself.\n\nIs it wrong that I feel good that someone I have a crush on is ok with just knowing me?

There's something about me that repels men away. Just the thought of a man being interested in me feels like a fantasy. I'm turning 21 soon, and I've never been on a date, had my first kiss, or had an actual relationship. My entire love life is just me fantasizing what it's like to actually have a man care about me. I always get excited when I have these thoughts, and then reality hits - this is something I'm most likely never going to experience. \n\nI hate it when people tell me to try harder. I do try and it always results in me getting rejected and humiliated. I literally have a list of every single guy who has rejected me. My standards are to the floor. My own sister cried when she saw the guys I've been asking out because she felt bad that I even considered asking them out.\n\nI've been seeing a psychiatrist for over a year. I have been doing well mentally, that's why I attempted to date. However, each rejection broke me. Slowly, I started to remember that I truly am ugly. The medications only gave me a false idea of myself. I'm actually fucking ugly, and only I was unable to see it.\n\nIt's so embarrassing now. My mother is already discussing me having a wedding and kids. My parents think that I've dated around and I'm just waiting for the right person to come along, but that's not the reality. I'm too embarrassed to tell them that no man has ever been interested in me. At this point, my mother is telling me to lower my standards even more so that I could find someone.\n\nI literally lie to them about going on dates. A \"date\" is just me going to a restaurant alone do have a few drinks.\n\nWhen I was in eight grade, one of my classmates told me that I'm never going to have a boyfriend. I was mad when they said this, but now that I'm adult, I can't help and reflect on the fact that this is becoming true.\n\nSometimes I just want scream at my parents for having me. It's as if they never considered the possibility of their daughter being ugly and alone. Life just feels like a curse.\n\nI'm just going to buy a 12-pack and drink myself to sleep tonight.",

I always get excited when I have these thoughts, and then reality hits - this is something I&amp;#39;m most likely never going to experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate it when people tell me to try harder. I do try and it always results in me getting rejected and humiliated. I literally have a list of every single guy who has rejected me. My standards are to the floor. My own sister cried when she saw the guys I&amp;#39;ve been asking out because she felt bad that I even considered asking them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a psychiatrist for over a year. I have been doing well mentally, that&amp;#39;s why I attempted to date. However, each rejection broke me. Slowly, I started to remember that I truly am ugly. The medications only gave me a false idea of myself. I&amp;#39;m actually fucking ugly, and only I was unable to see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so embarrassing now. My mother is already discussing me having a wedding and kids. My parents think that I&amp;#39;ve dated around and I&amp;#39;m just waiting for the right person to come along, but that&amp;#39;s not the reality. I&amp;#39;m too embarrassed to tell them that no man has ever been interested in me. At this point, my mother is telling me to lower my standards even more so that I could find someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally lie to them about going on dates. A &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; is just me going to a restaurant alone do have a few drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was in eight grade, one of my classmates told me that I&amp;#39;m never going to have a boyfriend. I was mad when they said this, but now that I&amp;#39;m adult, I can&amp;#39;t help and reflect on the fact that this is becoming true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just want scream at my parents for having me. It&amp;#39;s as if they never considered the possibility of their daughter being ugly and alone. Life just feels like a curse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just going to buy a 12-pack and drink myself to sleep tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I moved out of home at 17 into a big flat with 6 other girls. I was still a virgin at this point. Anyway, one of the first weeks there one of my flat mates had 2 boys around and me, the boys and 3 of my flat mates were sitting in the lounge playing drinking games. One of the guys kept feeding me drinks and I was young and naive so I thought he was being nice. When everyone decided head to bed I couldn\u2019t even walk straight I was so intoxicated, this guy followed me to my room locked the door behind him and wouldn\u2019t leave. He kept putting his hands all over me and asking for sex saying I\u2019d been asking for it. I told him I wasn\u2019t and kept saying no and that I didn\u2019t want to have sex. The last thing I remember is him in my bed and me sitting on the edge of it still saying no. I don\u2019t remember really having sex with him but We did have sex. I do remember afterwards though I ran out of the house down the street in just a dressing gown with blood running down my legs. I collapsed on the side of the road screaming and crying hysterically. Thinking about it is quite traumatic for me but I don\u2019t want to be over reacting if it\u2019s actually not that bad. \n\n2. A few months later I was at a club with my friends. One of them was 23 seeing a 48 year old man. The 48 year old had brought heaps of drinks and covered a table in them saying help yourself. I had one and the next thing I remember is gripping onto a table trying to stay standing and trying to stay awake. I remember my friend asking if I was okay and then I don\u2019t remember anything. The last time anyone saw me was at 10pm. I woke up in my bed the next morning naked. My flatmates said I showed up at home at 3am screaming and crying hysterically with no clothes on at all. I was just holding my shoes and nothing else according to them. I don\u2019t remember any of this and there is 5 hours of my life where nobody knows where i was or what I was doing. I also lived an hour and 1/2 walk from the club so if I did just walk home it shouldn\u2019t have taken that long and it doesn\u2019t explain the missing clothes. My flatmates didn\u2019t believe me the next day when I said I thought I had been drugged and just laughed it off as me getting to drunk so I didn\u2019t go to the hospital to get tested for drugs or get a rape kit. So I haven\u2019t told anyone else about it because no one has believed me.\n\nI just want so opinions I guess or advice or anything. I haven\u2019t told anyone aside from my old flat mates 4 years ago when it happened and it honestly felt good to write it out. I hope someone has some input.",

         "selftext": "I struggled with high functioning depression from the ages of 23-28. Things got progressively worse, peaking at 26-27. At 27, I finally admitted that this was a serious issue and I needed to do something about it. It took me 2 years of hard work to finally declare myself depression free, and I\u2019ve been so for over a year now. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky, I still have my periods of depression, but it always feels manageable. It no longer feels like a hopeless fight. I now have the tools to pull myself out. \n\n\n\nThe meat of this post is in the \u201cThings That Helped\u201d section. I included a background section because I thought it may help some relate, but you can skip if you\u2019d like. \n\n\n\nI know everyone is different, and that some of these things may be harder for you based on circumstances, but please don\u2019t let that be an excuse to give up.  \n\n\n\nThis post is not meant to be scientific. This is just anecdotally what I felt contributed to me being able to pull myself out of and  manage depression and anxiety. My hope is that someone can learn from my experiences or even just be motivated to give it another shot. I\u2019ll try to answer all of the comments I can. Wish you all the best. \n\n\n**Background**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**High School:** I was in honors and an athlete. I wasn't super popular, but I had plenty of friends and was pretty well liked. However, I always knew that I didn't experience emotions like others seemed to. My mother got breast cancer when I was 14. When my parents broke the news, I faked crying because I knew that's what I should do, not what I was actually feeling. \"I love my mom, why don't you feel these emotions, what the fuck is wrong with you, are you a monster?\" went through my head. Later in high school we were reading the 'Tao of Pooh' aloud and the class unanimously agreed that I had to read the part of Eeyore (I of course repeatedly fucked it up because I couldn't deal with the anxiety of reading out loud for the class, despite being great at it in elementary school). All that said I definitely wasn\u2019t depressed.\n\n\n\n**College:** Not really much to note here... After an awkward and lonely freshman year, I opened up and met friends. I drank a lot to get over anxieties and insecurities, but it was all socially. I did have my first panic attack, but overall life was pretty good and I was definitely at my happiest. \n\n\n\n**23-24:** I have a good job, health, friends, women are interested in me, everything a guy could ask for... However, I just don't FEEL anything. I don\u2019t want to do anything. Things just aren't fun anymore. I can't remember the last time I was excited about anything or anyone. I was constantly telling myself \"I just need a change\" or \"once I accomplish X things will be better\". At this point I openly admitted I had anxiety, but thought that depression was something only people whose lives were in the shitter could have. \n\n\n\n**25-26:** My life from an objective standpoint has only gotten better. I've gotten a better job in a better city, more accomplishments, more friends, etc. However, I feel even less. Anxiety/panic attacks are becoming common. It seems as if every accomplishment gives me a very brief fleeting feeling of 'things are going to be different/better' only fall back even further down, because now you're running out of things that you were counting on saving you. At this point, deep down I know that I\u2019m depressed, but I don't research it or talk about it, because I was afraid that confirming it would only drive me deeper. \"Your life is so good, you're not actually depressed, you're just pretending to be depressed for self-pity you little bitch\" would go through my head.\n\n\n\n**27-28:** I fell even deeper, finally admitted depression, and started working towards improving myself.\n\n\n\n**Current (29):** I no longer consider myself depressed. I don't think I'm 100% of the way there, but I'm greatly improved. I seem to be able to pull myself out before I get too deep.\n\n\n\n**Things That Helped**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Physical Health -** Honestly, I ate relatively well and was in good shape throughout this whole time, so it's certainly not even close to the cure-all everyone annoyingly seems to think, however, I did seem to feel even worse when I wasn\u2019t exercising and eating halfway decent.\n\n\n\n**Sleep -** Going from 5.5-6 hours of sleep to 7+ hours certainly helped a bit. \n\n\n\n**Supplements -** I had always taken a multivitamin. I tried 20 or so supplements/vitamines but didn't see much improvement. Magnesium probably helped improve my sleep a non-negligible amount, and ashwaghanda definitely helps me during times of extreme anxiety (takes me from say a 9/10 to 7/10).\n\n\n\n**Books/videos -** I'm a very logical minded person, so a lot of depression related content seemed to either not really understand or were filled with a bunch of woo woo bullshit. The one thing that sticks out as truly helping me was the \"Untethered Soul\". I listened to it on audible, because reading was tough for me at the time. There probably was some woo woo bullshit in there, but it certainly helped reframe some things in my mind. I highly recommend it. It was the first thing that made me feel like I\u2019ve made any progress at all.  \n\n\n\n**Taking breaks -** Once I fully admitted depression, I panicked and went full bore trying to 'fix myself'. It consumed my life. I was listening to audiobooks, watching talks, reading about it, researching supplements, reading this subreddit, etc. I began to define myself solely by it. It got EXHAUSTING, I was burnt out. This led me to not even care that I was depressed. \u201cI\u2019m doing all this work and getting nowhere, fuck this, I\u2019m hopeless\u201d. This subreddit was comforting at first because it helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t alone and helped articulate feelings that I was having. However, it can obviously be a very depressing place, and contributed to me getting caught in negative thought loops. Removing r/depression and r/toomeril4meirl or whatever it is from my subs was the right move.\n\n\n\n**Talking about it \u2013** This is hard. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never told anyone sober. I told my sister, and 3 very good friends. Of the 4 people I told, only 1 of which was any good at talking to me about it. My sister and 2 of my friends are great people, but they just didn\u2019t get it. They just kind of awkwardly responded \u201cOof yeah, that sucks, but your life is good, so you\u2019re really fine, right?\u201d The one who was good about it was a feely type of person, who would also open up about their feelings (they weren\u2019t depressed, but everyone is fighting something). I'm generally a very closed person, but I think the back and forth really allowed me to open up more than I would with anyone normally. I\u2019ve never been to therapy but could see how this would fill this role. However, I just don\u2019t know if I could truly open up to one the way I did with the friend.\n\n\n\n**Got a Dog \u2013** Dogs are great. I think the aspect providing for another life that loves you was really nice. He helped me get out on days I wanted to do nothing, talk to people (even if they only care about the pup), gave me couple brief moments of happiness throughout the day when he did something goofy, and someone to cuddle with when I was going though times of high anxiety. \n\n\n\n**Less Alcohol** \u2013 Drinking was sort of a catch 22 for me. I\u2019d drink because of depression/anxiety which would just drive me deeper. I really only drank about 2 days a week, but when I drank, I would drink A LOT. I still drink, probably a little too much, but I drink MUCH less than previously. My goal was to drink 2/3rds as often and when I do drink, to drink 2/3rds as much. This honestly wasn\u2019t very hard, and it equates to more than HALFING your total consumption. I definitely saw improvements after doing so.\n\n\n\n**Psilocybin** \u2013 I had read about psilocybin helping with depression and was curious to try it. So  about a year and a half ago, I did psilocybin with a friend. We set up a campsite and took about 1.5-2g each. Once I began to feel it, I got the urge to go wander off alone. So I went off alone and climbed rocks. I would see a cool rock, and make it my mission to get on top of it. Once on top, I would introspect for a bit and move on to the next rock. For the first time in years I felt genuine excitement, genuine appreciation, even a touch of self-love. It wasn\u2019t like I made some holy grail epiphany, I didn\u2019t uncover anything new, but everything I worked towards up until that point just made sense. Ever have a friend in an obviously bad relationship? You see it, everyone sees it, you tell them about it, they probably even logically know it, but for some reason there\u2019s this block in their mind they can\u2019t get passed. My depressed mind was stuck in the rut of someone in a bad relationship, but psilocybin allowed me to remove the block and see it from the perspective of everyone else. Just when I thought I cracked the code,  I relapsed into depression a little over a week later. However, this time it felt manageable. It no longer felt like a hopeless fight. I felt like I had the tools to pull myself out, and I did. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been ever since. I have stints of depression, but I can now pull myself out.\n\n\nI should note that I don\u2019t believe psilocybin alone would have helped the way it did. It was the final piece that helped tie everything else together and break the thoughts loops I was stuck in, but the real work was done prior to the experience. \n\n\nAll that said, obviously I\u2019m no expert, do your own research.",

Removing &lt;a href=\"/r/depression\"&gt;r/depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/toomeril4meirl\"&gt;r/toomeril4meirl&lt;/a&gt; or whatever it is from my subs was the right move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about it \u2013&lt;/strong&gt; This is hard. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never told anyone sober. I told my sister, and 3 very good friends. Of the 4 people I told, only 1 of which was any good at talking to me about it. My sister and 2 of my friends are great people, but they just didn\u2019t get it. They just kind of awkwardly responded \u201cOof yeah, that sucks, but your life is good, so you\u2019re really fine, right?\u201d The one who was good about it was a feely type of person, who would also open up about their feelings (they weren\u2019t depressed, but everyone is fighting something). I&amp;#39;m generally a very closed person, but I think the back and forth really allowed me to open up more than I would with anyone normally. I\u2019ve never been to therapy but could see how this would fill this role. However, I just don\u2019t know if I could truly open up to one the way I did with the friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got a Dog \u2013&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs are great. I think the aspect providing for another life that loves you was really nice. He helped me get out on days I wanted to do nothing, talk to people (even if they only care about the pup), gave me couple brief moments of happiness throughout the day when he did something goofy, and someone to cuddle with when I was going though times of high anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 Drinking was sort of a catch 22 for me. I\u2019d drink because of depression/anxiety which would just drive me deeper. I really only drank about 2 days a week, but when I drank, I would drink A LOT. I still drink, probably a little too much, but I drink MUCH less than previously. My goal was to drink 2/3rds as often and when I do drink, to drink 2/3rds as much. This honestly wasn\u2019t very hard, and it equates to more than HALFING your total consumption. I definitely saw improvements after doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/strong&gt; \u2013 I had read about psilocybin helping with depression and was curious to try it. So  about a year and a half ago, I did psilocybin with a friend. We set up a campsite and took about 1.5-2g each. Once I began to feel it, I got the urge to go wander off alone. So I went off alone and climbed rocks. I would see a cool rock, and make it my mission to get on top of it. Once on top, I would introspect for a bit and move on to the next rock. For the first time in years I felt genuine excitement, genuine appreciation, even a touch of self-love. It wasn\u2019t like I made some holy grail epiphany, I didn\u2019t uncover anything new, but everything I worked towards up until that point just made sense. Ever have a friend in an obviously bad relationship? You see it, everyone sees it, you tell them about it, they probably even logically know it, but for some reason there\u2019s this block in their mind they can\u2019t get passed. My depressed mind was stuck in the rut of someone in a bad relationship, but psilocybin allowed me to remove the block and see it from the perspective of everyone else. Just when I thought I cracked the code,  I relapsed into depression a little over a week later. However, this time it felt manageable. It no longer felt like a hopeless fight. I felt like I had the tools to pull myself out, and I did. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been ever since. I have stints of depression, but I can now pull myself out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should note that I don\u2019t believe psilocybin alone would have helped the way it did. It was the final piece that helped tie everything else together and break the thoughts loops I was stuck in, but the real work was done prior to the experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, obviously I\u2019m no expert, do your own research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "I\u2019ve had depression for a long time now. I feel like it\u2019s starting to sort of look up, kind of. Not in the sense that things are getting better, but in the sense that I\u2019ve gotten more hope that they CAN, and so I\u2019m slightly more motivated to not give up. I could go into more detail about this, but I won\u2019t because I\u2019m not trying to describe my depression. My problem, or at least one of my biggest problems, is more specific.\n\nSee, around a year ago, I started to have feelings for this girl at my high school. It started as a small thing, but as time went on my feelings only got stronger for her. But here\u2019s the weird part. I don\u2019t even know this girl. I mean, we never talk, and have no connections. But the thing is, it\u2019s more based on the way she acts than anything else, like as in behavior (and also slightly appearance, maybe). The terrible part is, I\u2019m not only severely depressed, I\u2019m also shy. This means that I\u2019m constantly wanting to talk to her but never work up the courage, and on those occasions that I do, I hardly have anything to say (usually I will make up an excuse to talk to her like asking her about something music-related for our music class). Now, I don\u2019t know anything about her or her personality, and I have no idea why I want to be with her, to be completely honest. Based on all logic, I know she\u2019s not interested in me, since she never talks directly to me the same way I try to with her (while very rarely), but I have this sort of gut feeling that there\u2019s something between us. Now, this gut feeling kills me, because all logic points to it being wrong, and it also prevents me from moving on in my life because I\u2019m hung up over her. I don\u2019t know what being in love really is, but I\u2019ve never had feelings so strong for anyone else (maybe just a particularly strong crush? I don\u2019t know anymore honestly). \n\nThe fact that I see her every day and am powerless to speak up is honestly just a crushing, terrible feeling, and it makes my depression so much harder to deal with. Can someone please tell me why this is happening to me? Is this love? It\u2019s honestly gotten to a point that I feel it\u2019s way too unhealthy for me to be love. My theory is that this stems from a bigger problem in my life: I\u2019m alone. My mother is distant, non-understanding and cynical most of the time, also being erratic and difficult to deal with. My father left my family when I was very young. There is no other family I have, except in faraway places that they cannot help me (and they\u2019re not helpful when they visit, either). My friends, of which I only have two or three, never have enough time to be there for me when I need them, and then in the end: neither my friends nor my family understand why I\u2019m sad in the first place, so they always fail to cheer me up. My theory is that the reason I\u2019m so hung up over this girl is because I\u2019m desperate for someone to care about me, to get me, and to be with me. Honestly if it hadn\u2019t been for this girl, I would have most likely ended it all by now. It feels like this is the only shot I have at someone caring about me. But honestly I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I can\u2019t keep going on being alone and unloved. It saps away at my very life force and drains me of my will to live.\n\nCan someone please talk to me and help me out? Someone who truly gets my pain and knows what I\u2019m talking about. Is this love? Or is it just in my head? What is going on in my life? I don\u2019t know why I need a relationship so badly, but I absolutely, 100% know that I need it. The tiniest hope that this one relationship could work out is the only thing that has kept me going in life. If that hope goes away, I don\u2019t think I would keep going. I did my best to explain all the important details, but it\u2019s difficult to put these concepts into words, so if you have any questions just ask.\n\nOr you can just scroll down past this post and not do anything, I won\u2019t mind. If you read this far, and didn\u2019t skip through any of it, thank you so much. It means a lot that you cared enough to read the whole thing.\n\nAnyway, have a good day and I hope your world is bright and warm.",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve had depression for a long time now. I feel like it\u2019s starting to sort of look up, kind of. Not in the sense that things are getting better, but in the sense that I\u2019ve gotten more hope that they CAN, and so I\u2019m slightly more motivated to not give up. I could go into more detail about this, but I won\u2019t because I\u2019m not trying to describe my depression. My problem, or at least one of my biggest problems, is more specific.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, around a year ago, I started to have feelings for this girl at my high school. It started as a small thing, but as time went on my feelings only got stronger for her. But here\u2019s the weird part. I don\u2019t even know this girl. I mean, we never talk, and have no connections. But the thing is, it\u2019s more based on the way she acts than anything else, like as in behavior (and also slightly appearance, maybe). The terrible part is, I\u2019m not only severely depressed, I\u2019m also shy. This means that I\u2019m constantly wanting to talk to her but never work up the courage, and on those occasions that I do, I hardly have anything to say (usually I will make up an excuse to talk to her like asking her about something music-related for our music class). Now, I don\u2019t know anything about her or her personality, and I have no idea why I want to be with her, to be completely honest. Based on all logic, I know she\u2019s not interested in me, since she never talks directly to me the same way I try to with her (while very rarely), but I have this sort of gut feeling that there\u2019s something between us. Now, this gut feeling kills me, because all logic points to it being wrong, and it also prevents me from moving on in my life because I\u2019m hung up over her. I don\u2019t know what being in love really is, but I\u2019ve never had feelings so strong for anyone else (maybe just a particularly strong crush? I don\u2019t know anymore honestly). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that I see her every day and am powerless to speak up is honestly just a crushing, terrible feeling, and it makes my depression so much harder to deal with.

Losing all my grandparents the final one passed in 2016\n\nIn between this time I was ok with my life. I found a friend that was a true friend again but sadly I found out she committed suicide in 2016 but I didn\u2019t find out until 2018 when a friend got a text from her sister saying they never had services but felt we should know. \n\n3. I met a guy who was so lovely we instantly clicked it was one of those hallmark movies where the girl gets her happily ever after but that happiness faded and we done within 7 months this year. \n\n\nI have a lot of good things in my life but I\u2019m often left wondering what is next in store for me.   I almost feel like I never grew up even though I have my own job and home. I\u2019m 30 and my friends either have kids or significant others they are with. \n\nMy cousin who I didn\u2019t grow up with but we met as adults and clicked instantly. We both went through a break up 7 months ago. My cousin just announced she\u2019s getting married to her longtime friend she met at a church. I can already see and feel the changes. Less texting, chatting among us. I understand people meet others and do change but damn it hurts. The only thing I get texts about now is save the date for our wedding and she wants me not only there but in the wedding as well. \n\nIs it bad of me to wonder when it will be my turn? I\u2019m not jealous of my cousin truly happy for her.  I feel like I\u2019m a great person and a catch for someone. I just am left to wonder is it me? Will I get married someday or even have kids/family that I always envisioned?",

Title is self-explanatory, but I\u2019ve been struggling for quite some time now, finally pulled the trigger to go talk with my doctor for the first time about this and he diagnosed me with depression with anxiety (to no surprise). I\u2019m in the process of seeking a counselor as well too, so I don\u2019t want this to be a low point for me, rather than the moment where I realized I can\u2019t do this alone.\n\nI\u2019m a productive worker and still give it my 110% (though I\u2019ve lost interest in it). My manager and I have a good relationship with us also talking about personal matters (sometimes). I told him a while back I was struggling during one of our 1-on-1\u2019s and that I felt like I was drowning while everyone was swimming, we talked about it and he helped reassure me that everything was okay. He also told me had struggled with depression before and he had counseling services (which I thought was nice that he had opened up).\n\nI was planning to pull him aside and update him on my situation and just reassure him of what was happening and that I plan to get through this, but also try to ask for more leniency/patience on some days that might be tougher than others (I\u2019ve never taken a mental health day before though I have gone through breakdowns in the bathroom before to hide it). My mom has discouraged me from doing this. Exact words being \u201cYour manager is not your friend, therefore you shouldn\u2019t be telling him about your personal problems. You can\u2019t trust him and that this won\u2019t come to bite you in your ass eventually.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone have any experience/thoughts into this? I\u2019ve been pretty open with my friends about it who have been very supportive, but obviously coworkers are a different story where I don\u2019t want to skip around the office and announce it. I thought it\u2019d be nice to tell him just in case though. Thank you everyone and sorry for my life story on this lol",

I'm trying to teach myself but I'm not learning nearly as easily as I did when I was younger, I'm constantly lethargic, I'm inarticulate as hell.... I'm a fucking retard now.
