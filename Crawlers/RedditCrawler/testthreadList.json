         "selftext": "I know this mentality probably sounds selfish but I'm so selfless, sad and self loathing in all other aspects that I feel like I'm allowed this one thing.\n\nIf you make someone, who is at their lowest, possibly near suicide, feel like a burden, gaslight them or make them feel like they're the problem and that they're causing everyone discomfort with their pain, you're a total piece of poop. Even if the person in pain is struggling, even if they're at a low point, even if maybe they're not doing all the things they should be doing like going to therapy, you are total garbage for making someone who already feels like a burden, hates themselves, needs love and care now more than ever, and is at the lowest point of their lives, feel worse about themselves.\n\nI understand boundaries and I respect them. I understand not being able to be there for that person every waking minute because that's actually just selfish (even though this is what I do no questions asked for everyone but that's my choice). But I don't understand abandoning someone or making them feel worse about their situation or mental health problems then they already do. I'm so tired of the pill pushers, I'm so tired of people insinuating I'm not trying because I'm not currently in therapy and sleeping a lot - of course I'm not trying I'm doing fucking bad, I'm tired of people saying things like \"things will get better,\" \"be more positive,\" \"you can't be so negative and only focus on the bad things.\" Yup, okay, lemme just turn it off. Now there are sunshine and rainbows shooting out my ass and life is hunky doory.\n\nThis rant was brought on because every single fucking time I'm at my worst, every single time I find myself crying to sleep for weeks straight or not sleeping at all, every time the suicidal thoughts come back and things get real bad, EVERY FUCKING TIME I lose all my friends. Usually the girls who I hang out with the most first. And then, when I'm doing better, when I have money again, when I'm my normal, bubbly self who builds everyone up, acts motherly and makes everyone feel happy by just being around me, everyone always tries to flock back. All the \"wE sHoUld HanG oUt I miSs yoUuUu\"s come out of the woodwork. All the \"maybe we can be friends again when you're doing better for yourself\" and \"you're a burden to your friends\" are supposed to be forgotten. I get it, it's more fun to be friends with Pooh than Eeyore but do you know how much it fucking sucks when you're so sad that your Eeyore?\n\nAgain, from the outside I may sound selfish but I really am one of the least selfish people I know. I'm the friend who will drive 5 hours in a snow storm to make sure someone's alright, I'm the friend who defends everyone against toxicity, I'm the friend who's there listening to everyone's every last word while I'm secretly dying inside. So I feel I'm entitled to this one thing, this one bout of selfishness, because I'm tired of people being so fucking fake. I'm tired of friends not truly caring and being alone in my worst state constantly. \n\nIn my 23 years of life, this has happened almost every single time I've become really bad, once in high school when my childhood house foreclosed, once at the beginning of college after ending an abusive relationship and now when I'm having serious family problems and my disabled brother is running out of answers for care (I helped raise him and still do but this is a longer story). Every time I'm hurting, I get abandoned and everytime everyone else is hurting, I'm mother Teresa. I'm so tired of being the good person. I mean give me a break, a burden? Are you truly traumatized by someone you love being in pain? An inconvenience or uncomfortable thing to talk about maybe. Maybe it isn't the #1 thing you want to talk about. Maybe you could've spent that hour or so talking about something happier and less serious. But give me a break with the fucking \"burden\" shit. The only \"burden\" these people have, from my understanding at this point, is their lack of empathy and humanity. They're also, not surprisingly, the same type of people who are mental health warriors and post suicide support things on their social media pages constantly. Or the people that if they do lose someone, don't stop griping about how they wish they could've done more to be there for them. What a fucking joke. \n\nDisclaimer: as stated in the title, any abusive or toxic behavior completely negates this mentality. If you need to drop someone who is problematic or hurting you for your own mental health, you're not abandoning them - you're just not enabling them anymore.. I've been in this situation too so I understand and it is much different.",

Throughout high school I struggled with anorexia, and alongside all the regular teenage angst it pretty much ruined my social life. I've fully recovered physically, but I've been more depressed than I have been in years because now that I'm interacting with people again, I realize that there's something I lack that everyone seems to have. Something I didn't get in my lost years that everyone else seems to have.\n\nIn the past few months I've become closer with a person I've known for about a year, and developed some fairly intense feelings for her. I was so sure she didnt reciprocate, but very suddenly she said that she did and had for some time, so we made plans to go on a date. Then just as suddenly, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, had stuff to figure out, and that we couldn't talk anymore. And well, that fucking hurts. I have a final in eight hours but I cant bring myself to give a shit. She's all I can think about.\n\nI've thought about suicide a lot since I started university. I dont think I could ever get the willpower to go through with it but I have started smoking cause I hear on average each cigarette shortens your lifespan by 4 minutes. I think I'll smoke a pack this afternoon.\n\nThank you for reading.",

I left and was very pissed off myself because it was a situation everyone would have handled just fine besides my anxious ass. I was overwhelmed by everything that happened so i decided to take a tavor. It helped me to chill for a while but i fell asleep and missed my appointment with my shrink.

I cannot remember much but i think i became close to OD because i had to puke.\n\nThe next morning i woke up sadly and was alive.

In social situations my anxiety would cause a feedback loop of hyperaware self criticism and At home my thoughts would wander uncontrollably from obsessive self loathing to sometimes an existential panic. The fear of rejection or failure and the self hatred would become overwhelming.

No suicidal thoughts or psychotic episodes though.\n\nNow I\u2019ve learned to handle the creeping panic attacks and social anxiety but I just can\u2019t get past this dreadful hole I find myself in. I have a career in front of me that I am passionate, friends, and a general sense of purpose in life; a far cry from how I felt a few years ago. Yet despite all of this progress, just getting out of bed and actualizing my goals is absolutely terrifying. My mind is still always on edge and constantly overwhelmed. Adderall cancels out the noise but ironically only exasperates my impulsivity. I just need something that clears my mind and gives me emotional clarity. It\u2019s like when you need that extra boost of courage at a party from a few shots of whiskey, only I need that sense of ease just to get out of bed and I\u2019m not interested in an alcohol addiction.\n\nI\u2019m seeing a psychiatrist after the holidays but I was wondering what methods other people took to get past these symptoms.

My childhood was rough, for my earlier years I lived in San Bernardino, particularly ghetto areas and hoods (Muscoy and East Valley), but later I came to Orange County. Anyway my father was abusive in every way and addicted to meth and later became a drinker. I feel like I was just dealt a bad hand. I feel like both hands are off the wheel now and I have nothing but a bottle in my hand just staring through the windshield. Sure I have good things going like an assistant manager position at 18 years old and some opportunities likes acceptance to community college with a computer science major, being able to sustain myself on my own (moved out of parents house), and I have some friends that are very close. But I just feel romantically frustrated and abandoned, and just fucking alone and I feel nothing, absolute dissociation from this reality. Some days its to the point where I literally can\u2019t feel my skin, could be from dehydration because I do too many drugs and drink too much because I\u2019m a fucking idiot.

They make it such an overwhelming impossible task that someone who DOESNT suffer from mental health issues would have a hard time doing it so to expect someone who does is ridiculous..... the last time I had an appt I was in the middle of a bout of agoraphobia so it was a horrifying experience to go but then I got there and was told that the provider cancelled my appointment 3 days before and I wasn\u2019t notified which they shrugged off like it was no big deal .... I didn\u2019t sleep for almost a week going into the appt and then sat in Chicago morning rush hour traffic to get there... so it was a big fucking deal to me. \n\nAnyways my teeth have fallen into a state where I can no longer pretend that they aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d. My stepdads dentist is a really good guy and is going to see me anytime a patient cancels (I live very close) ... I am still on the hook to pay for some of the treatment but the majority he is doing for free. The problem is I\u2019m overwhelmed thinking about it all .... I\u2019m trying to be proactive but I haven\u2019t been able to sleep and I feel like I\u2019m in this perpetual state of panic I can\u2019t get out of. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what part of all of this is causing the stress and panic .... it\u2019s probably multiple things but it\u2019s really really shitty to not see a way out of this feeling which got me in this mess in the first place. Does anyone else feel like it\u2019s a never ending cycle? \n\nAny suggestions on how I can handle this panic feeling? It\u2019s not so much the actual physical appt itself - the typical things like sound of the drill or the pain don\u2019t really bug me it\u2019s literally EVERYTHING else all the way down to leaving the house now ... I tried to go out last night to the store just to get something to eat for dinner and I just froze up and couldn\u2019t leave - just went back inside and made soup ... the store is less than a 5 min walk and it was later in the evening when it wouldn\u2019t be crowded but I still couldn\u2019t get myself to cross the threshold of my door ..... I just feel like things are now getting worse and not better so I\u2019m frustrated with the \u201cone step forward two steps back\u201d thing I have going on now.\n\nAny helpful suggestions or comments are welcome!",

         "selftext": "I\u2019m 30, I\u2019ve been depressed since I was 7. \n\nMy parents divorced, my relatives who I was raised by teased me so badly that I defecated in my pants until I was 13 years old.  I can remember being laugh as a 10 year old on Christmas morning with actual shit in my pants at my Aunts house by my entire extended family.\n\nMy family used to say I was retarded, useless, and not good for anything except shitting myself.  My parents would just let this happen.  I think I was honestly just a mistake, because they never wanted anything to do with me except abuse me. \n\nWhen I finally went out, made friends, and eventually started partying as a 17 year old - they put me in a treatment facility, cutting off all ties with anybody I knew.  \n\nWhen in family counseling, they would roast into me how much of a nuisance I was to them and how everything was my fault. \n\nMonths after graduating, my only favorite uncle, only favorite grandma both died in the same month.  The month prior, I got a tumor in my knee.  That same month my brother, the only one who pretty much primarily raised me, tried to commit suicide multiple times. \n\nI had over 20 episodes of kidney stones and surgeries from 20-30, recently being diagnosed with a rare gene disorder known as CASr.  I will have to take medicine that will dehydrate me substantially everyday for the rest of my life or suffer a stent in my urethra. \n\nThe only love of my life(5 years) and only real gf I\u2019ve ever had left me for another man.  \n\nI had to drop out of college because of surgeries. \n\nI got injured and will never be able to work my dream job again. \n\nRecently my dog just turned 12 and isn\u2019t doing so well. \n\nI just had to drop $2000 on my car repairs in the last 2 months. \n\nI had to move back in with my sadistic parents, more sadistic then ever, recently due to break up. \n\nI\u2019m in crippling debt from school and hospital bills, my injury does not allow me to make the money I need to surpass this anytime soon. \n\nMy ex-GF is obsessed with letting me know she\u2019s fucking somebody else. \n\nI have not 1 friend nor family member I can trust.  \n\nBut despite all of this, I guess I\u2019ll try again tomorrow.  This time I\u2019ll come at it different, this time I\u2019ll know I\u2019m going to fail inevitably. \n\nAnd it\u2019s going to be all be OK, there was never a shred of hope in my life to begin with.  And tomorrow I will expect nothing less, going back *home* to my parents basement defeated and worthless. \n\nI\u2019ll go back again tomorrow, I can see pain on a person from a mile away.  I know it with every sensor, I know exactly how to comfort them.  How to make them feel loved.  If it wasn\u2019t for the two long dead relatives who showed me their compassion, I might not be *this*.  \n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have 7 texts from 7 different people, all waiting to dump their emotions, sorrows, and struggles apathetically towards me.  Lord knows not 1 of them will ever to do it for me. \n\nBut I\u2019ll help them anyways, because I never want anybody to experience the true depth of loss for which I\u2019ve felt my entire life. \n\nI will wake up and physically push my body to the limits, until there is nothing left.  To do anything less would mean to feel again. \n\nFor me, to feel anything at all anymore is a death sentence.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for my shitty job that I put in overtime to not even make my bills every month.  \n\nIt consumes me and makes me forget.  Everybody around me is pissed off and ready to go live their happy lives outside of this shithole. \n\nI\u2019m sad to leave.  I will face m reality once more when I get back *home*. \n\nMy past was dark, future darker.  But now, well, I\u2019m tired.  Too tired to think, only ramble off a bit before my next shift.  \n\nWhich I will go into working as hard and precise as I can, making considerable progress, and my coworker who does nothing all day will continue to receive the raises and promotions. \n\nI will go into work dead tired, doing laps around 3 fully rested, terrible mood coworkers.  \n\nI will congratulate them on how well they did. \n\nI give this to you, my dear reader: \n\nI feel like my life has been the most intense training session ever.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m 30, I\u2019ve been depressed since I was 7. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents divorced, my relatives who I was raised by teased me so badly that I defecated in my pants until I was 13 years old.  I can remember being laugh as a 10 year old on Christmas morning with actual shit in my pants at my Aunts house by my entire extended family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family used to say I was retarded, useless, and not good for anything except shitting myself.  My parents would just let this happen.  I think I was honestly just a mistake, because they never wanted anything to do with me except abuse me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally went out, made friends, and eventually started partying as a 17 year old - they put me in a treatment facility, cutting off all ties with anybody I knew.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in family counseling, they would roast into me how much of a nuisance I was to them and how everything was my fault. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months after graduating, my only favorite uncle, only favorite grandma both died in the same month.  The month prior, I got a tumor in my knee.  That same month my brother, the only one who pretty much primarily raised me, tried to commit suicide multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had over 20 episodes of kidney stones and surgeries from 20-30, recently being diagnosed with a rare gene disorder known as CASr.  I will have to take medicine that will dehydrate me substantially everyday for the rest of my life or suffer a stent in my urethra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only love of my life(5 years) and only real gf I\u2019ve ever had left me for another man.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to drop out of college because of surgeries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got injured and will never be able to work my dream job again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently my dog just turned 12 and isn\u2019t doing so well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just had to drop $2000 on my car repairs in the last 2 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to move back in with my sadistic parents, more sadistic then ever, recently due to break up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m in crippling debt from school and hospital bills, my injury does not allow me to make the money I need to surpass this anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ex-GF is obsessed with letting me know she\u2019s fucking somebody else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have not 1 friend nor family member I can trust.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But despite all of this, I guess I\u2019ll try again tomorrow.  This time I\u2019ll come at it different, this time I\u2019ll know I\u2019m going to fail inevitably. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it\u2019s going to be all be OK, there was never a shred of hope in my life to begin with.  And tomorrow I will expect nothing less, going back &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; to my parents basement defeated and worthless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll go back again tomorrow, I can see pain on a person from a mile away.  I know it with every sensor, I know exactly how to comfort them.  How to make them feel loved.  If it wasn\u2019t for the two long dead relatives who showed me their compassion, I might not be &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I\u2019ll have 7 texts from 7 different people, all waiting to dump their emotions, sorrows, and struggles apathetically towards me.  Lord knows not 1 of them will ever to do it for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I\u2019ll help them anyways, because I never want anybody to experience the true depth of loss for which I\u2019ve felt my entire life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will wake up and physically push my body to the limits, until there is nothing left.  To do anything less would mean to feel again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, to feel anything at all anymore is a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m so grateful for my shitty job that I put in overtime to not even make my bills every month.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It consumes me and makes me forget.  Everybody around me is pissed off and ready to go live their happy lives outside of this shithole. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sad to leave.  I will face m reality once more when I get back &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My past was dark, future darker.  But now, well, I\u2019m tired.  Too tired to think, only ramble off a bit before my next shift.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I will go into working as hard and precise as I can, making considerable progress, and my coworker who does nothing all day will continue to receive the raises and promotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will go into work dead tired, doing laps around 3 fully rested, terrible mood coworkers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will congratulate them on how well they did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I give this to you, my dear reader: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like my life has been the most intense training session ever.  Because the very few times the fog has cleared, I\u2019ve found little to no competitors worthy of what I set my goals in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much pain and heartbreak, never catching a break.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family is absolutely terrified of me.

         "selftext": "Why?\n\nI have many questions, but the one that comes up in my head the most is \u201cwhy\u201d? Why have kids if you won\u2019t care for them? Why do you constantly lie? Why do you make promises you can\u2019t keep? Why won\u2019t you be the dad that raised me to be kind and love one another? Why?\n\nHonestly, I could go on and on, but I\u2019d have a book then. I miss my dad, he died several years ago when he stopped pastoring his church. Since then, another man has took my father's body and made life harder everyday since. Some of my earliest memories are of him yelling in my face with his full drill voice. When he punished me, it was way worse. He would take me to a dark room because I was terrified of the dark, and he knew that. So he would whoop me in the dark, just to make sure that my punishment was good enough in his eyes. I am now 18 and still scared of the dark because of those mental scars.\u00a0\n\nI understand that this is the past and I should let it go, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to let go or forgive him for this, mainly because I never got an apology. My dad has a problem owning up to his actions, he\u2019ll find a way to turn it back on you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry it came off that way\u201d. I thought maybe one day he would see what I do, feel the way I do. I\u2019m still waiting.\n\nSometimes, I blame my dad\u2019s growing up. He was born in 1961, Which means he was raised in a rough time period. A lot of racism, sexism, and homophobia, was around during that time. Not to mention, the Vietnam war had just started. He didn\u2019t really have a stable father figure, men came and went, most of them were in the military, so they weren\u2019t around much. He was raised Strictly catholic, so you think he would grow up to be a respectful man right? Well not exactly.\n\nMy dad fell into the wrong crowd. He started using drugs and becoming someone he didn't even recognize. One day he went too far and became aggressive. He and his girlfriend were having a fight, my dad want to have sex, she did not. So he forced her into his car and drove off with her. She pressed charges for Kidnapping and rape. The rape charges were pled down to aggervated asssualt, he was going to serve 8 years and 6 months total. During his time in prison he converted to christaninty for the promise of always being forgiven for his sins. Around the 5 year mark of his sentence he was let go on good behavior.\n\nNow imagine, you are googling people you know of and your curious about your dad so you google his name and find out your dad was put in prison for kidnapping and raping someone. I felt betrayed, I\u2019ve always asked him if he ever went to jail or prison and he lied straight to my face. Still don\u2019t feel right about it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt's not over, skip forward a bit to my mom and dad\u2019s marriage. My mom had her own hardships in the past but was forthcoming with it, mom and I never had secrets. That\u2019s why I knew that there was something wrong when she started shutting me out. I would hear her crying in her room softly, but she would never admit it. What I didn\u2019t know, my dad had sent a text to her, that wasn\u2019t meant for her. He was cheating on my mom and it wrecked her. She gained weight from comfort eating, red puffy eyes from crying all the time. She decided to stay with him because of me, and I wish I would have known cause would have told her to leave him.\n\nMy mom suffered in silence for years, because he figured he could keep doing it and get away with it because my mom wouldn't leave him. One day, my mom had enough and made him leave. I still didn\u2019t know why, so naturally I missed my dad and asked my mom if we could move to him. So we did, and he continued to cheat there too. We moved again, but mom had enough and she divorced him.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we were free, or so I thought. It\u2019s been 6 years since the divorce and he only visits one weekend out of the month.\u00a0 Which Is fine, except for the fact that each one is hell because he thinks about himself which starts drama. Then the next three weeks are spent healing from that weekend. Then he comes back and does the same thing.\n\nAn Idea was presented. He wanted to talk like adults and try to mend what happened in the past, but his one condition is what set me off. His condition was after the\u201dmeeting\u201d and he apologized properly the past can no longer be brought up. That\u2019s When I figured out he only wants this over, nothing he would say would be sincere. So I refused.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s gotten away with so much more, I refuse to let him get away with this.\u00a0\n\nToday is Sunday, December 1, 2019, and I\u2019m still waiting.\u00a0 \u00a0",

         "selftext": "Hey. As explained in the title, I have been suffering with being paranoic all the time. I wake up thinking all the time on the most dumbest ideas and I just can't relax myself. \n\nThe first reason of me being paranoic is about a deformation I have on the right side in the back of my head. It's something that nobody can see it but I can feel it all the time and it really sucks. And the feeling is like my head is cutted in half, just because of that deformation on the right side. It really makes me sad because when I focus on the left side of my head I can feel how smooth it is, like heaven. And then I just realise how much worse the right part is.\n\nWell I guess you may think this is nothing and I should just not think so much and get over it, but I really can't do it because my life has been so empty, depressing and I REALLY can't feel good around people, I've tried it a lot of times.\n\nYesterday I went out with some friends and I was always that kind of guy that never accepts to go out and all of that simply because I know I won't like it... but at the same time it's still better than being at home all day alone. So I just went with them and sometimes I think to myself how can they just be so happy and laugh and so crative talking feeling this confortable and all. We were 4 and they were all laughing jumping around having fun man, and I was like pushing myself to laugh as well for 8 hours straight, feeling like shit inside and also my head so fucked up. I really can't have emotions so when I'm like trying to be funny or I have some funny story in my head, most of the times I just stay quiet because I can't explain it with emotion and then I know it will be a complete mess. \n\nI'm also virgin, never had a girlfriend and sex in my life, currently with 23 years old. I've been thinking on having a girlfriend many times but I know she wouldn't like me. I just know it because I also wouldnt like her too... Having this idea to have a girlfriend just to finally have one is just stupid. So I'd rather stay alone until I'm finally cured.\n\nI also don't have good friends, I do have like some friends that are good people of course. But we are not much together because they know I don't like to be with them so much. And when we are together our conversations are so boring because my life is boring overall. I have nothing to say and no will too.\n\nSome people I found on internet said I am a overthinker, I think too much and should just enjoy life. They acted like this was just a little problem but the truth is, I can't see how I can fix this because I can't live with this feeling on my head all my life... it's just so disturbing. And telling this to doctor makes me feel so unconfortable because it seems to be something really small but the feeling is just annoying.\n\nI tried to go to doctor today but woke up too late... Slept 4 hours today, couldn't sleep early. I will try to go tomorrow...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so any help would be appreciated guys, I'm feeling like this for so long and I don't know how much I can handle this. :(\n\nThanks.",

Shortly after losing my home (I lived with him) and my 3 cats (the only reason I stayed with him) I met an amazing man who genuinely loves me. He spoils me and tries his best to make me happy. He has been institutionalized and suffers from depression as well. Well after I got fired I tried to continue doing the same line of work and failed then tried 3 or 4 other jobs and also didn't last long at them either. Well I finally just started another job but I hate the people, the customers everything and I feel so miserable. I can't seem to find anything that makes me happy anymore. I can't seem to feel any real emotions anymore. I try counseling but I can't afford it and I can't keep asking my bf for money. I try and do things that once brought me joy, such as video games and that just is nothing. On top of that today is my one day off with my bf and my bf has completely decided to stop talking to me and we live together so I've gone 24+ hours without speaking to someone. I don't know what I did or if he's mad or if he's just being his introverted self but I tried reaching out to my \"friends\" but both if them simply replied with that sucks and hasn't said anything else. Anyways, I don't want to die but I just don't want to be around anymore. I want a completely new life, new name, new scenery. I feel like I'm losing my freaking mind and I'm getting backed into a corner.\n\nTldr; I'm sad and this made me feel worse",

Last year I was diagnosed with epilepsy and dissociative seizures and my life went from career-woman to someone housebound, unemployed (except for my hobby business) and I can\u2019t drive. Ive been stuck in my house since June 2017. There\u2019s no public transport nearby and I have no close friends or family to help. I\u2019ve become crippling lonely. I have a partner but he works four days at a time with virtually no contact. My son is great but he\u2019s also 4 so there\u2019s not much in the way of adult conversation.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted the play Magic the Gathering. My partner recently decided he wanted to as well. So I spent a full day learning the rules, how to do combat, what everything means and so forth. Then we went to a local store to but cards that also holds casual game nights and serious matches and we were invited to come down and play. So we started playing at home heaps and I really got the hang of it and was good at it. A few days in my partner told me we had been playing wrong and the rules I learned were incorrect, so I had to relearn the whole game again with the way he said the rules are. I just took it as he is right, and I am wrong instead of questioning it. Because of my neurological problems I struggle with memory so I worked really really hard to get to a point where I could play. So I\u2019ve reset and relearned the game for a second time.\n\nHowever, today, after playing online my partner told me I was actually originally correct in how I was playing, that he was wrong and I\u2019d have to relearn the game again. So I just quit. It was at the point where I wasn\u2019t going to be able to unjumble the multiple sets of rules. And start again for a third time. \n\nI was so excited and then it turns out I didn\u2019t have it and have to start all over again. It\u2019s not an easy thing to master for someone with my brain problems and I worked really hard. I became really good at it too after about 50 games.\n\n\nWhy did I work so hard? I so badly wanted to be a part of a group. I wanted to go make friends and do something I enjoy. I thought I would finally find a way to get some reprieve from the crippling loneliness I feel. Ever since I became sick I\u2019ve lost my ability to do most of the things I love, I was so excited to make friend close by that I could Uber too and afford it. I wanted to learn new things. I wanted to get in with all of the others games that are played too.\n\nNow my partner is down at the store playing with everyone and another friend because he can pick any game up after a few rounds and I\u2019m at home, lonely, trying so hard to make something hobby wise work for me and I can\u2019t. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just depressed because I thought I\u2019d have something to ease the feeling of uselessness I feel and I unintentionally got screwed. I was excited and I feel like a dumbass for thinking things could get better.\n\nAt least my partner is having fun, which is an upside.",

I can\u2019t do these basic things, let alone think a song might be a hit. I have zero to no luck nor does hardwork or smart work equal to success. People judge me, give me these fucked up depressing looks and being nice and natural isn\u2019t good enough anymore you got to be an asshole and I don\u2019t have the mind to be one.\n\nI need to change my sound completely, and that is just better off me trying to work a day job.\n\nI don\u2019t need millions of dollars or to be adored, that is hardly even a goal.\n\nI just need progression, progression that is organic\n\nBut now it seems like every door is closed\n\nPerformance opportunities have dwindled and my sound has become obsolete.\n\nCan\u2019t really find a good number of paying audience to sustain the band even though the band version 2 has been exceptionally tight and on par with many major bands.\n\nAnd there\u2019s seems to be no point to bringing all that energy during a show.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth even performing anymore\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense\n\nAnd If I quit then it\u2019s waste of all these years\n\nI really have put the hard-work and it\u2019s nice to have a progression.\n\nBut being trapped in Singapore and to do it all over again in another country, for e.g the states.\n\nI don\u2019t have the energy to do another Caitlin Stasey. I am tired, burnt and want to escape and vanish into peace.\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever I seem to have enough passion and drive upon, doesn\u2019t seem to work\n\nSo I play it safe, it\u2019s hard to be this way. But I guess I don\u2019t want to be hurt and my focus should be on my family for now. \n\nI have failed them miserably by following my own way\n\nI could have been an engineer earning the money needed to sustain myself and my family. \n\nBut thinking of all that, it just makes me want to either restart and make the changes or just simply kill myself and give up. But what about my sister? I can\u2019t leave her behind! I had all the luck exploring places with my two feet unlike her and I want to be there for her. (She's got cerebral palsy)\n\nI don\u2019t know Singapore, I think a place on your island will soon be my grave. I have lost myself trying to make it up to you.\n\nMaybe not this lifetime, but perhaps the next one. Thank you for making me live this far. It has been wonderful.

I can\u2019t do these basic things, let alone think a song might be a hit. I have zero to no luck nor does hardwork or smart work equal to success. People judge me, give me these fucked up depressing looks and being nice and natural isn\u2019t good enough anymore you got to be an asshole and I don\u2019t have the mind to be one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to change my sound completely, and that is just better off me trying to work a day job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t need millions of dollars or to be adored, that is hardly even a goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just need progression, progression that is organic&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now it seems like every door is closed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Performance opportunities have dwindled and my sound has become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can\u2019t really find a good number of paying audience to sustain the band even though the band version 2 has been exceptionally tight and on par with many major bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there\u2019s seems to be no point to bringing all that energy during a show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth even performing anymore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t make sense&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And If I quit then it\u2019s waste of all these years&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really have put the hard-work and it\u2019s nice to have a progression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But being trapped in Singapore and to do it all over again in another country, for e.g the states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t have the energy to do another Caitlin Stasey. I am tired, burnt and want to escape and vanish into peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, whatever I seem to have enough passion and drive upon, doesn\u2019t seem to work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I play it safe, it\u2019s hard to be this way. But I guess I don\u2019t want to be hurt and my focus should be on my family for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have failed them miserably by following my own way&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could have been an engineer earning the money needed to sustain myself and my family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But thinking of all that, it just makes me want to either restart and make the changes or just simply kill myself and give up. But what about my sister? I can\u2019t leave her behind! I had all the luck exploring places with my two feet unlike her and I want to be there for her. (She&amp;#39;s got cerebral palsy)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know Singapore, I think a place on your island will soon be my grave. I have lost myself trying to make it up to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe not this lifetime, but perhaps the next one. Thank you for making me live this far. It has been wonderful. I don\u2019t think I have the courage to keep going on and beyond, it is very scary and I don\u2019t have the will, drive or the energy to face it.

I remember when I was young, I mean 8 or 9 and I definitely had some issues but I was proud of a lot of work that I did, I remember doing a leaflet about the lives of otters and ii drew all the otters and wrote all the facts in my best hand writing in pen with no mistakes.\n\nOver time this started changing, I got into high school and had a difficult time socialising and making new friends, people seemed to grow up without me and I stayed the way I was in lower school. I upset some people because I was a little shit and I got my ass kicked by a popular boy, since then I never really changed.\n\nThe bullying began when I turned 14-15, I felt very small, very ugly and people said so, I was systematically humiliated and had 0 confidence, I buried my self in video games to cope.\n\nNothing really changed and this went on, finally I left education at 19 and trained to be a hairdresser, ii got through it, just, but ii was really unsocialised and struggled to connect with people\n\nI quit hairdressing when I was 21 and ended up homeless, ii found a place to stay with friends but couldn't hold down work, after some bbad times we fell out and they kicked mee out.\n\nSince then I have been homeless on and off, including times of sleeping rough. I had no idea what I was doing in my life.\n\nNow I've taken to drinking a lot and I have smoked since I was 20, I got into drugs and did a lot of cocaine (even on myy own) which I have stopped now.\n\nIve messed up all my relationships with my girlfriends and my jobs, i now take care of my Grandmother full time, all my energy goes on her. The rest of the time I spend in bed, when I should be studying, I get brief moments when I feel motivated but they don't last long before I resort to bed dwelling again.\n\nTldr: I struggle to motivate my self to do any work, I have dreams but I feel like ill never achieve them, I've taken anti depressents before, but I'm not sure if that is the right choice for me. I know I need to find the energy to see a doctor. Not sure why I'm posting here, guess just to vent. All the best to you all.",

I upset some people because I was a little shit and I got my ass kicked by a popular boy, since then I never really changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bullying began when I turned 14-15, I felt very small, very ugly and people said so, I was systematically humiliated and had 0 confidence, I buried my self in video games to cope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing really changed and this went on, finally I left education at 19 and trained to be a hairdresser, ii got through it, just, but ii was really unsocialised and struggled to connect with people&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit hairdressing when I was 21 and ended up homeless, ii found a place to stay with friends but couldn&amp;#39;t hold down work, after some bbad times we fell out and they kicked mee out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I have been homeless on and off, including times of sleeping rough. I had no idea what I was doing in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve taken to drinking a lot and I have smoked since I was 20, I got into drugs and did a lot of cocaine (even on myy own) which I have stopped now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive messed up all my relationships with my girlfriends and my jobs, i now take care of my Grandmother full time, all my energy goes on her. The rest of the time I spend in bed, when I should be studying, I get brief moments when I feel motivated but they don&amp;#39;t last long before I resort to bed dwelling again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: I struggle to motivate my self to do any work, I have dreams but I feel like ill never achieve them, I&amp;#39;ve taken anti depressents before, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if that is the right choice for me. I know I need to find the energy to see a doctor. Not sure why I&amp;#39;m posting here, guess just to vent. All the best to you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "I won't get too in to detail but I wasn't liked much as a kid/teen and in a good way it helped me grow up and come to understand people better. In past years I used to have crazy anxiety over it, my mood swings were all over the place, one day I was confident, the next I was timid and was scared to talk to people because I was scared they wouldn't like me. Honestly I'm thankful for everything that's happened in my life, as much as I would like to say I'd like to redo everything, I wouldn't. I believe everything in life happens for a reason. Even though I felt lonely, lost and wasn't sure who I was anymore, it helped shape me as a person. People who barely knew me were judging me because of other kids were talking about me behind my back, calling me stupid and \"retarded\". It crushed my self confidence and honestly I hated myself, it wasn't until a year ago that I started loving myself, and over the past year, my confidence, my anxiety, honestly everything has changed. I wasn't hated by everyone at the school by any means, but my reputation was pretty much just me being a loser. As much as I want to say my past is behind me, it isn't and it's affecting my present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year was Grade 12 for me or year 12, and every year before that I kept telling myself throughout high school that I would start trying in grade 11, prior to that I did no work, and was just passing my classes. My depression got the best of me and I started skipping, a lot. At one point I skipped for 3 weeks straight, it got to the point where I was so unmotivated and sad I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. It was only when I got a call home saying that if I didn't go to school I was going to be kicked out. I ended up failing grade 12. I don't find school hard by any means, but my work ethic is awful and I'm scared for what the future has in store for me. This year I'm back doing another year of grade 12, and I just want to say that from the start of this school year to now, I haven't felt happier. I've been focusing on me, what I need in my life, cutting out the toxicity, I do feel lonely sometimes, but I know when I put myself back out there I'll find the group of kids I'm looking for, that's something I'm looking forward to in university/college. Anyways I feel like I'm all over the place here, my point is all my bad habits are getting the best of me, and I want to know how to just overcome lack of motivation and just do it. I know that question will vary from person to person as everyone is different, but I guess I'm desperate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a gf of 4 months, we've been great friends for around 8 months. She's quite possibly the most amazing girl/person I could have asked for. We shared a class together, before we became friends a friend of mine was cracking jokes to her that I was going to ask her to prom, quite honestly the best thing he's done for me even though he obviously had all the wrong intentions. Later that night she texted me and that was when we started talking. I already had a crush on her, not that anyone knew that. Honestly I admired her, she was funny, easy to talk to, funny, cute, extremely likable, smart, and kind. I love this girl with all my heart and she has no idea what kind of great impact she's had on my life. I've never been happier and I'm not going to say it's all thanks to her, but she's definitely got a part in it. Anyways we talked for a great while, and all people did was make fun of her, but slowly but surely her close friends were accepting of it, and here we are. One thing that's always bugged me about our relationship is how secretive of it she is. She doesn't want me commenting on her social media (She wouldn't be mad or anything if I did, but she'd prefer if I didn't) because she doesn't want kids from high school to see it, not that she's ashamed of me but she doesn't like being judged because of it. Honestly can I even blame her, the one thing I've been trying to do is better myself, my mental health is great, I'm not the kid I used to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've been trying to do is better myself like I said before. The saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger applies a lot to my life. Well all anything in my life has done, is make my skin thicker, I don't care anywhere near as much what other people think of me. I mean I do a little, but everyone cares to an extent, if you say otherwise you're lying. I've pretty much changed my entire wardrobe. The thing was I cared too little about what other people thought about me, I stopped caring about everything in general, and the fact that this girl saw through all my flaws and still dated me makes me love her that much more. Anyways one thing I want to do for myself is get really fit. I just want to look great, not for anyone's opinion to change, but almost as a big fuck you. Who the fuck are you to judge me, try judging me now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know everything I need to do, it's just a matter of doing it. I just feel so lost because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, I don't want to just pick a career and settle for it. I want to do something I enjoy, the problem is my interests change all the time. One moment I love something, the next second I don't care anymore. I've also been pissing away this year again, I'm currently doing a victory lap or pretty much grade 12 again, and honestly I've barely done anything and I'm mad at myself, I'm tired of blaming everything on my past. I'm tired of getting mad at my parents and telling them they wouldn't understand. Essentially I'm tired of feeling bad for myself. It's time for me to get my life together, I'm going to make everyone in my life proud. I'm going to start off by making a schedule, I'm going to follow that schedule, I'm also going to make days for my gf to come hang out with me, other than that I'm going to focus on school rn. It's time for me to follow a schedule for once in my life. I don't even know why I'm going to post this because I've pretty much made a plan for myself right here. I guess I just needed to rant and be clear everything up for myself because whether I like to admit it or not, sometimes I don't realize why I'm upset until late at night when I'm alone and have time to think clearly without any distractions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI focused too much on trying to please other people and not enough on myself. If I could go back in time I would try and set myself straight. Throughout my entire life my priorities have been totally wrong. I wish I could've told myself that what these kids thought of me doesn't matter. I'm thankful that I decided to write this, I feel much better and am thinking clearer, I'm not feeling sorry for myself. All I know is I'm not going to take shit from anyone anymore.",

         "selftext": "I'm a 24 year old guy working a dead end job with no college education or future prospects. I have barely any friends and I'm also a virgin who hasn't so much as held hand or kissed a girl even. I don't get along with my family whatsoever and had an older brother who would emotionally abuse me my whole childhood and a shitty father and I don't have any interest in speaking with them. I don't have the energy or willpower to move to do anything productive. I've tried everything and I'm at my ends now.\n\nMy whole life it felt like I was just been going through the motions, on autopilot with fog clouding up my brain and there wasn't much that made me happy or glad to be alive. I dropped out of college after 2 weeks and just started sitting in my dorm for the rest of the semester playing videogames and eating pizza and cheeseburgers. After that, I went to live in a tiny apartment with my family and began working deadend jobs and continue being depressed. I soon realized that I needed to make some changes and began to try everything I could think of to break out of this spell.\n\nI began trying different SSRI's from the doctors in hopes that they would help with my depression but all they did was make me numb and get no joy from anything anymore even music which was pretty much the only thing that could make me happy. I still feel that taking those had some long term effects on me where it's harder to feel joy now but idk. After that I tried going to the gym and eating well, I did this for about a year and was still depressed and eventually stopped. \n\nAt this point, I knew living with my family in their tiny apartment wasn't helping. I moved into an apartment with a couple of friends and was able to start doing some things again. I began cooking a lot and started eating a lot of rice, chicken, and fish + fruits and greek yogurt mostly. I started to read about psychology and just how the mind works but with a specific interest in the habit loop. I planned to use this knowledge to break some of my negative habits and form positive ones in their place but I've had trouble applying it. I started to do yoga and read a lot more and I felt myself gradually getting better it felt like. This whole time the debt from my college experience and my car loan were too much for me to handle and I just started ignoring the debt collectors as I tend to go back in my shell and ignore problems when they're too much for me.\n\nWhile living with my friends, I took acid a few times and it changed my whole perspective on life. I started to spend a lot of time working on electronic music I bought a guitar and it felt like my life had purpose now and something to work towards. This invigoration lasted about a year and then eventually I just felt all my creativity and will to live disappear again at which point I started taking DXM occasionally. It feels like I need to be high on something or I can't be happy or creative.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I got formally diagnosed with ADD and began taking adderall to help with my concentration. Again, I felt completely reinvigorated and began to find joy in being productive. I completely stopped playing videogames and started spending that time learning web development, music production, astrophysics, philosophy, geometry and just anything that interested me. Eventually my motivation quit on me again. I started to feel a lack of progress, I tried to work through it with journaling but to no avail. That happened around March of this year and I haven't been able to do one productive thing since and I quit the adderall after 2 months of it not working. \n\nI became good online friends with a trans girl on the other side of the world about 9 months ago. For 3 or 4 months we would play video games together or just talk for 8-14 hours every single day. She would tell me all about her deepest secrets and we would vent to each other and I really enjoyed spending time with someone for once. I haven't been that intimate with someone since a girl I had feelings for in high school. Anyway we gradually stopped spending as much time together and I would make her feel guilty for it and kind of be mean to her for wanting to spend time with anyone else. She put up with it for awhile but after a few months she just kind of is over the bullshit and blocks me for a few days if I do anything a little toxic. I developed feelings for her but she doesn't feel the same way about me and it's really hard for me to just be her friend. I got into obsessively seeing what she was up to and kinda estalking her I guess and being mean to her when she spends time with anyone else. and I hate that I can't stop myself from doing that. I don't know how I'll ever be able to form a real relationship with someone when I know I'll just be obsessive and creepy and toxic if things don't go my way. I've done this to any girl I've gotten feelings for that talks to me back and I hate that I can't just be chill.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I really don't. I've tried therapy. I've tried all sorts of medication. I've tried exercising and eating healthy. I've tried developing hobbies that give me joy. I've tried to get close to people but anyone I get close to I'll just be toxic to. I eat like shit right now, I don't have the energy to cook or go to the grocery store and just order food every day. I don't clean. All I do is sit and play videogames with high school friends or the trans girl all day and wait for her to want to talk to me. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I can't fix my life and I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I just can't be consistent. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? I don't think I'll ever be happy at this point. I've tried as hard as I can to fix my problems but they won't go away. I probably have some underlying personality disorders from how I treat people or maybe some kind of form of OCD from some other things I do but I can't really afford therapy and when I've tried there's been 0 progress. The only thing I think that could make me happy is having a girlfriend that makes me want to be better for her but I can't imagine even getting one in my current state or anytime soon and everyone just would see me as pathetic with my lack of experience. I just don't know what to do. I have too many issues and it feels like every every step I take forward I take two steps back.",

I loved him so much and I still love him and I am not sure if I want to get another hamster, because he will die too and I'll only be sadder.\n\nI hate winters. All bad things happen in winter. I made this account for depressive memes because in December 2018 I broke with my ex-boyfriend. In 1 year I haven't improved at all. I thought life would be better. It wasn't only in these winters, the first time I've cut myself was in winter (2016). All winters are bad and harsh. \n\nI have tried therapy but it honestly didn't help.

Yet, my efforts and partial understanding of other things made people think I was smart so they could mock and use me, or I always expected good grades and was just being inconsiderate and downplaying my obvious success. \n I&amp;#39;m not really good at anything. I&amp;#39;m not really good looking. In fat, I have no figure. I don&amp;#39;t have good social skills, and people usually don&amp;#39;t like me. And im slowly spiraling in part from the loneliness. I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s much tonlok forward to for someone like me, someone who doesn&amp;#39;t socialize well enough for other people. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

With this being said, I recently was suicidally depressed and wrote out a suicide note; life was meaningless (and still maybe is) and i was full of nihilism despite going to therapy and getting good grades at University and being part of a social fraternity.  I didn't want to live, and being quite honest there is a part of me that still doesn't; that hardly changes. BUT what helped me was listening to Jordan Peterson -a clinical psychologist/philosopher and prof. at Toronto Uni-. I highly suggest any one who is confused about why the fuck we're here to look up one of his hundreds of videos on Youtube and try your best to really concentrate and think about what he's saying ( he's quite sophisticated and complex). I don't want to preach and be the type of guy that says this is a \"quick fix\" or \"life changing\", but for me his words hit deep and it was honestly reassuring listening to someone like him admit that life is hard and mostly suffering but it's how you respond which makes it meaningful.  I hope i can could help anyone who wants/needs it.\n\nBTW: To all the Jordan Peterson Fans, I knew of him way earlier (2015 or so) and got my life on track (so i'm not new to the rodeo nor trying to start a new \"fad\"), but after \"cleaning my room\" and \"standing tall with my shoulders back\" i got comfortable and slumped back into mediocrity ... I have learned a valuable lesson about continuing to strive for greatness even when you're doing fine.\n\nGood Luck Everyone, and God Speed (if you believe in God lol)\n\nTLDR: Look up Jordan Peterson",

         "selftext": "I\u2019m a senior in high school. I\u2019ve hated myself more and more since my junior year but I only motivated myself because of one person. A dear friend of mine, she was my sole reason to try. I swear, the only reason I made it through the past year was because of her. I didn\u2019t think I would have been able to get out of bed every morning if not for her. I wouldn\u2019t have eaten, worked, or exercised if not for her. All she had to do was be in my presence, and I would feel happiness. I didn\u2019t cry myself to sleep because I would fantasize about life together, in the future. I guess I only cared about myself because I felt I had to be the best for her. She never knew any of this. \n\nI had always thought I was asexual or just had a really low sex drive. I had never been interested in girls, dating, etc. and I\u2019ve only had what I can describe as light crushes. Barely even that. This person made me feel feelings I didn\u2019t even know existed. When you would do anything for them, and you just can\u2019t stop thinking of them. We played video games together, watched movies. Hung out, developed inside jokes, made memories. I grew more and more attracted to her over my junior year. \n\nI confessed my feelings four months ago. You can guess how it went. I respect her wishes. But I felt horrible that she had to deal with me now. So I ghosted her. I want her to forget about me so that I\u2019m not even a bad memory anymore. I remember in the following weeks waking up, crying, having just terrible, awful dreams. I sometimes just ran, at times like 2am as far as I could before I collapsed from exhaustion. I despised myself and punished my body.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t care. Of course they wouldn\u2019t. I hardly think they see me as anything more than test scores and trophies. I told my mom, but all she said boiled down to \u201cignore it and study, or I\u2019ll send you to a psychiatrist.\u201d She told my dad and he even mocked me for it when we got into a heated argument, and it was out of nowhere. I punched a hole in the wall and left for a while and slept at a friend\u2019s place. I guess that is all I need to say about them.\n\nI\u2019ve been functioning, but that\u2019s it. I do my work. When I\u2019m with my friends at school, I try to act normally. I crack jokes and talk. But when I get home, I\u2019m a fucking mess. I\u2019m practically fueled by self hate right now. I work out to extreme pain or I sleep for 12 hours. I eat tons of shit food or starve a while. I often think ending my life but I also know that I shouldn\u2019t. Every time I have a flash of considering suicide, it scares me. I\u2019m scared one day I\u2019m going to have the conviction to just end it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I have so many constant reminders of her. One of her favorite songs playing, a mention of a show or movie we watched, or even the fucking mention of one of her pastimes, it feels like someone\u2019s choking me. I don\u2019t remember a day that\u2019s gone by where I haven\u2019t cried over her. Completely unrequited love. Complete fucking loser fucking idiot fuck I hate myself I just want to go back three years to the last time I remember I felt genuine happiness. I\u2019ve never told anyone this. I took this old account to get some shit off my chest and put my broken unorganized crying mess of a confession somewhere out there. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing or want anymore.",

As the months went by being made fun of was a daily thing for me. The main thing that got me through that tough time was video games. I could play all day and night. Some days I wouldn't do my work because I was to stressed out to work and used video games as my escape (Rainbow 6 siege, Smite, Minecraft, and Halo). Playing my game isolated me but made me feel better. In 2017 we moved to a new house and my parents thought a private school would be better for me (8th Grade). Well that didn't work out either. I didn't get made fun of but I also didn't have any friends there. Just imagine one full year of having know one to talk to. And in order to compensate I stayed in my room played my video games. At the time I was failing some of my classes but I didn't care because I wasn't the best student at the time so I knew they wouldn't hold me back, they definitely did not want to deal with for another year. As that year went by I stayed in my room longer and longer, only coming out when I had to eat or use the bathroom. And even some days I didn't eat of wash up because it would interrupt me playing. I swear that I was super close with my family but over time I became much more closed off from my family. Now i'm in high school. You know more work, harder classes and lots of stress. All the stress built up so I relieved it by playing video games. My games use to take the pain away but now it seems to make it worst. All day I just stay in my room, some days I will just stare in a blank TV for hours on end. This part I really don't know how to explain in words, but i'll try anyway. It seems that my mind attacks me with all my past mistakes and they haunt all day and night if I don't distract myself. And when that distraction is over it feels like i'm getting pelted with hundreds of rocks. And the only place I feel safe is my room. My parents call my room a dungeon cause they don't see me outside it. But when I leave my room i fell out of my element. Like i'm not allowed to be myself. And when I try to be myself I get yelled at. Its like I have to wear a mask when I leave my room or i'll be petrified. BUT here is the best part my parents say i'm hard to talk to or its difficult to get along with me but when I try to limit their exposer I get yelled at. I try to be nice but it doesn't come naturally to me. My mom thinks I enjoy being mean. I don't know maybe it could be the years of being made fun of, hey I apologize i'm not the son you wanted.",

I still have a social life and would party with my friends but I always felt insecure at times or have anxiety. At times I\u2019d feel depressed and sometimes think about what it was like if I was gone out of nowhere, but overall happy, weird to say.\n\nWhen I Made a Change: I started noticing my anxiety in some social situations, and one day in a lecture started having what I thought was a heart attack, I was having a panic attack. I\u2019ve always been a worrier but that was my first since then I\u2019ve had a couple more and rushes of anxiety. Started feeling like I needed to get it taken care of or I would \u201cgo off the rails\u201d\n\nAnxiety and Treatment:\nI function well and complete tasks and goals and have friends, but I\u2019m can be constantly worried, I\u2019ve before at 2AM, in bed, randomly started worrying about how I\u2019m going to handle my taxes this year which led to a lot of other things that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about mostly uncomfortable thoughts and once I pushed one out another thought would start. After taking to a therapist and being prescribed kolonopin it helped and I went through a period of more mild anxiety. Recently I noticed I was beginning to have those same random thoughts again, and talking to my therapist about it, and was prescribed Xanax.\n\nWhere Zoloft comes in: \nI have been worried about benzodiazepine addition when I was first prescribed klonopin, so when I was prescribed Xanax I knew that it is more dangerous than K, so I have only been allowing myself it once or twice a week even though I\u2019m prescribed 1mg upto three times a day, (1mg doesn\u2019t do much to me not sure why because I never took the K daily or much more than 3 times a week). I started taking Xanax more as my anxiety\u2019s gotten bad and have been taking them more than I\u2019d like to allow my self and started to almost self medicate when I\u2019ve been having this anxiety more which now includes depression (I\u2019ve been considering myself a high functioning slightly depressive)\nSo worrying about building up a dependency to benzodiazepines I said that I think I would like to try a low level or lose dose antidepressant even though I hate the idea of it, didn\u2019t really want the stigma of anti depressants and side effects, but did because it would be something more long term and overall mood changing and It could possibly benefit me.\n\n(I do know Zoloft is supposed to take weeks was told 4 weeks for your fam to see, 8 for you)\n\nDay 1: Took it about noon, a bit later I started feeling kind of hazy and almost high, dis coordinated at times. I also paced a bit during the day, hung out with a friend felt pretty fine and and later felt a bit nauseous, barely noticeable though, at night I was very anxious and took a klonopin. \n\nDay 2: Took Zoloft at the same time. Called off work \nWas hazy again and pacing more and was not comfortable. Played video games and talked to family for most of the day, talked to them a bit more about what\u2019s going on. Took a kolonopin. Was getting depressed, had to go get gas for my car and on the drive there was listening to music and thought that if I was to get in a car accident and die this would be the time (sounds sad typing this and actually letting people hear) when I left the gas station I passed  my sub and just felt like going on a drive which was relaxing. I felt depressed still at home and was having anxious ruminating thoughts on the past and took another kolonopin and went to bed.\n\nDay 3: Woke up felt fine took the Zoloft around the same time as the day before felt a bit hazy again but fine was pretty content with everything, later went to work and felt like a zombie felt like my brain was cloudly and that I had little emotion, looked at things from the past and got sad but smoked a bit and went to bed.\n\nI seriously think I\u2019m having side effects because before I\u2019ve always been happy, driven, but a worryier and possibly a high functioning depressive but I\u2019ve never been like this. Am I experiencing side effects? Should I contact my doctor?",

Was getting depressed, had to go get gas for my car and on the drive there was listening to music and thought that if I was to get in a car accident and die this would be the time (sounds sad typing this and actually letting people hear) when I left the gas station I passed  my sub and just felt like going on a drive which was relaxing. I felt depressed still at home and was having anxious ruminating thoughts on the past and took another kolonopin and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Day 3: Woke up felt fine took the Zoloft around the same time as the day before felt a bit hazy again but fine was pretty content with everything, later went to work and felt like a zombie felt like my brain was cloudly and that I had little emotion, looked at things from the past and got sad but smoked a bit and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seriously think I\u2019m having side effects because before I\u2019ve always been happy, driven, but a worryier and possibly a high functioning depressive but I\u2019ve never been like this. Am I experiencing side effects? Should I contact my doctor?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The next two years it turned into some fairly bad anxiety and depression, I\u2019m now 15, in year 9, going onto year 10. I spent all of this year wandering the halls trying to find someone to talk to, nobody was there. I felt so isolated in this pitch black claustrophobic box they call depression.

She was the light of my life, for once i was finally feeling better about myself. Unfortunately, for reasons I\u2019m not going to say because shes everything to me, she decided it was better to be friends (for the time being). She told me that yesterday. It destroyed me, i planned to ask her out the weekend coming. It may only be for the time being but shes now leaving me on delivered for 2 hours at a time, which to me feels like a lifetime. I told her that I\u2019m going to wait for her until shes ready for a relationship, however long that may be. But i have a feeling that the longer i wait, the worse ill become, because I\u2019m now back to having nobody. When she told me that we could be in a relationship when shes ready I reminisced of a particular scene from bojack horseman.

I know this sounds like some dumb kid overreacting about a relationship, and yeah, it is, but to me, shes all i had. It feels like it would be so much easier if i just kill myself, then i wouldn\u2019t have to be so dramatic about this. Im sorry for wasting your time. \n\nThanks for reading if you did :(",

I had plans to do many things these holidays: Work to get some money to buy maybe something I want, go out with friends, play video games (obviously), lose weight and study, as my results recently have been sub-par, which I had decided to change over the New Years.\n\nBut nothing is fucking going to plan.\n\nI'm a Blackbelt in Taekwondo and during sparring a few weeks back, I blocked a kick with my hand in an extremely awkward position. It severely hurt my wrist but after 2 weeks it got better, with some mild annoyances still present; but mostly better. Jump to the present 7 weeks later, turns out an X-ray revealed that I had fractured the third metacarpal, meaning that I would be stuck in a splint on my dominant hand (right) for 6 weeks, the entire length of my holidays. \n\nIts now significantly harder to do anything, including writing this goddamn long rant about my fucking life. Gaming is a big part of my life which I often indulge in during the holidays: I can fucking say goodbye to that shit. \n\nI'm also naturally lazy, despite being a consistent 80%+ performer while studying for tests on the day, but my 57% math score really did a number on me, let alone my Asian parents. Before my splint, I started studying an easy 3 hours a day, as it gave me a sense of relief from my bad score as I felt like through hard work would make up for my past mistakes; a sense of redemption. My fucking injury has made it impossible to do maths equations (injured writing hand), meaning I will have to work doubly hard with online resources like Khan Academy instead.\n\nI've read many articles on injury caused depression recently, and the general consensus that I've come up with is the first step is too accept the limitations.\n\n\\- There will be no video games\n\n\\- studying will be harder\n\n\\- Life will be harder\n\nI do still have a speck of hope that when the physio gives me a more high-tech splint that allows my ring finger to move a pen and play league or my recovery will be faster than the allotted 6 weeks, but the truth has started to dawn on me that there is no easy way out from this injury.\n\nFriends are something I still have, as hanging out with them would still be a distinct possibility if my mum didn't go apeshit. My grandparents are coming over and I had planned a sleepover which was harshfully rejected as I should 'spend time with my grandparents.' They are here for a good 3 weeks and I'm sure they will also go out with friends during their time here, meaning that my request to spend time with my friends does not seem unreasonable. One thing she uses against me is my report, which I only got 6 A's and 3B's , and it doesn't help that 2 of the B's are maths and science.\n\nIn a way she is not wrong, but I've been feeling like shit recently, and she nor my injury is helping. I felt like dog shit before I was this restricted and now I'm feeling even worse. In the past I would not play long hours to feel good, but to relieve the emptiness, pain of life and real world worries. I don't blame my mum for getting triggered at me, as she doesn't fucking understand anyway. Even I think my life is pretty stress free from her perspective.\n\nI've spent my last weekend doing nothing; being lazy and watching YouTube while craving for a game of League of Legends with some friends. I have become the person I vowed to destroy; stupid, lazy and fat.\n\nIf anyone has any tips it would be appreciated; Thank you.",

The first 3 Christmas\u2019 we\u2019re cool. He would get me gift cards and got me 1-2 gifts under the tree. We got married last June, and I gave birth to our son 10 days before Christmas. My childhood was always fucked up and Christmas was the only day when it seemed right so I am kinda obsessed with Christmas. Last year for Christmas, we didn\u2019t get each other anything. I didn\u2019t have the time or energy as I was high risk and at the doctors constantly. This year, our baby is finally a lot easier, and I have told my husband I wanted gifts. He gave me a present the other day which was an ornament that I absolutely love, but tonight he told me he was just going to put a few things in my stocking, and nothing under the tree. I honestly feel horrible for being so sad about this because growing up we had nothing so I understand what it feels like to get nothing, but I have done all of the shopping for nieces and nephews, our son, and got him presents as well. I don\u2019t want to be greedy, but I feel like it will be sad if he and my son are opening presents and I have nothing to open. His family never celebrated Christmas growing up because they\u2019re from Hong Kong, but he knows how important Christmas is to me. I have told him about my wish list I made, I have told him things I want or need, and he\u2019s just not internalizing what I am saying. My best friend is highly mad at him because he doesn\u2019t really understand the things I do for the family, and never listens to me and constantly ignores the things I say or ask, but I just think we are having trouble communicating our love languages. Am I being greedy or do I have a right to be depressed about it? \n\nThanks in advance",

I hid it for a long time, but about a year and a half ago my facade cracked. I crumbled, my grades dropped off, and my parents finally figured out something was wrong. They sent me to therapy, which lasted for months, and anti depressants, which I'm still on today. While I was... better, at the end of it, and not as intensely sad, I find that these days I've just been dead inside. Emotions are shallow and fleeting, and in addition to the ennui and inertia, I'm still haunted by a nebulous sense of loss (of what?) that therapy couldn't banish. I'm somewhat more functional, but even that feels like it's balanced on a knife's edge. I'm not sure what to do. I hate the idea of talking to my parents, becoming a burden again, especially when I leave for college next summer. I don't want them to think the entire first ordeal was for nothing. Anyways, if therapy only partially worked the first time (with a therapist I liked and respected) how can I expect it to work this time? I'm not sure anybody can make me less simultaneously apathetic and fragile, less simultaneously distant and hungry for connection. What the hell am I supposed to do?",

I will ALWAYS be a second thought, a second choice. It\u2019s been this way forever and I don\u2019t think it will change. I hope nobody I know reads this, honestly. I hope nobody knows its me. At the same time though, all I want is for someone to just listen and hear my desperate cry for help, and be there. Be a friend, for my family to actually support me. \n\nI\u2019m in such a dark place, it\u2019s so hard to even make myself leave my house. I feel nauseous even thinking about sleeping because I know I\u2019ll only have to leave in the morning. I\u2019ll have to put on a smile, hell even a blank face and get through the day. And even then, I still cry. A hopeless feeling, all of this is.. i don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing all of this, part of me just feels like a burden consistently and that includes on any place I decide to speak my mind. I feel so empty and this is honestly just another cry for help, a cry for someone to notice me. Because the people in my life who claim they care... don\u2019t. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change.\n\nThat\u2019s all. Thank you, for anyone who actually read this. I\u2019m just really hurting right now. I have been, and there\u2019s so much to deal with that I just don\u2019t have the energy for.",

I started drinking more water and trying to eat healthier on a budget.  \nThen I thought it was because I wasn't working out enough. So I tried doing more pushups and running.\n\nThen I just accepted I'll never be able to wake up on time, and it must have something to do with my depression.\n\nI guess I just don't want to stop dreaming. I don't want to wake up and face the day. I don't want to have to go through the same shitty cycle that I have to go through every day.\n\nI might not be able to graduate high school because I've been late for class about 3/4 of the days of the year so far, since August. I can't tell them it's because of depression, because even my family doesn't believe it and doesn't care, so I just say I slept in, every single day.\n\nIt sucks. Everyone thinks I'm irresponsible. Or that I don't want to go to school. Or that I don't want to wake up.\n\nI'm such a morning person. There's not much that beats long morning drives as the sun rises. It makes me so happy to get up early and start the day right and be energized for my first period, and getting work done so I don't stress about it later, and just being up at 5:00 AM. \n\nI haven't woken up earlier than 6:45 AM since August or September, when school started again. I've missed several days of work because I just don't wake up, and my boss doesn't like it at all and I have to lie about my reasoning. I've failed classes because of this. I've talked to my therapist and he recommended to change things like my eating and exercise habits, but it's not helping at all. I'm still not waking up in the morning.\n\nI literally don't hear my alarm go off most days. The days I do, I guess I unconsciously turn it off. Yes, I get up and turn it off and go back to bed without thinking about it at all. I wake up and the first thing I think, lying in bed feeling sick, with a headache and fighting the urge to not start crying (which is my daily wakeup) is about how much I just want to die. How much I want to never have to show up late again. How much I want to just get out of this fucking world early so I never have to get cancelled on by my fake fucking friends again.\n\nI just want to be happy again. I want to look forward to the day ahead. The only days that I was able to wake up on time this school year were the days that I was doing something fun and not going to school. My parents use this as a reason to push their case, even though I genuinely enjoy school when I wake up on time and don't trudge in an hour late.\n\nI don't know why I woke up those days. I guess I was just really happy to be doing something and travelling and helping others (one of them was like a mental health awareness day, and I was volunteering.) \n\nI don't know how much longer I can go on like this. People always give me that bullshit about \"it gets better!\" but does it really? It doesn't feel like it. No matter what I've tried, I'm still stuck in this shitty place.\n\nWith love.",

         "selftext": "Okay I don\u2019t know where to begin so I\u2019m jumping right in. I\u2019m married I have 2 kids. I got with my husband back in 2002 when we were kids and we had many breaks in between, involuntary and voluntary, but started dating again in 2007 first baby in 09 and married in 15 and second baby in 16. When we were dating I found out about his cheating. I had the cell phone and I allowed him to use it and I heard voicemails from other girls about them meeting up and whatever. So I knew it was going on. Found condom in my backseat he said it was because of his friend. I am no dummy but I was so head over heels so I took the lie and went with it. Fast forward some and he went to jail and I cheated. I was 21 and I was hurt by his cheating and I also wasn\u2019t ready to settle I guess. I was confused. Then I got pregnant in 09 with our first born. We fought. My oldest daughter is a true miracle. She was so tough to survive and she made me survive for her! But I was stupid and never left. I knew so much of his continued cheating but never left. I was happy until i thought of his cheating. But over all the years I knew I never cheated back. Saw the girls pictures in the phones saw the messages and still stayed. I\u2019m stupid. 2016 I was pregnant and he was always fussing at me and putting me down. Told me so much mean things I would cry constantly. Did he care ? No. Was I stupid for staying? HELL YES!  He wouldn\u2019t come home at night and one night he didn\u2019t come home until after 3 pm the next day. Wouldn\u2019t answer or text back. Came home with what looked like cum on his shirt. He denied it I knew it. Stupidity won again. Fast forward to 2019 I found him cheating. He had girls in the new house we bought a few months before and I saw the evidence of that 2 times. He was at a hotel with a girl. Tracked him there from the uconnect out 2018 cars had. He wouldn\u2019t open the door. He protected this other girl. He fussed at me and made me leave after showing my ass. He wouldn\u2019t open that door! Ugh! That was in March 2019 and I kept having that pain inside me from that. I  did something I NEVER do and i confided in someone else at my work. Then it turned to a different form of friendship. We started sleeping together. He was married and I was married and we shouldn\u2019t have done what we did. We talked daily and then my husband found out. He went to my work to confront him and it turned violently ugly. We said we wanted to work it out and then we didn\u2019t then we did and so on so on but I\u2019m severely depressed because 1) I have depression 2)I\u2019m bipolar (he always thought it was a joke and discouraged me from taking care of myself ) and he constantly torments me about what I did. I\u2019m all the names in the book. I\u2019m a awful mom and woman and nothing about me is good anymore. He does not even acknowledge that he has been cheating on me for years! And that he protected someone else over me. Everyday he has something negative to say. He hates my body now ( I have a nice body but a slight baby pouch ) he hates everything about me. When he found out about my cheating he held me down and cut my hair off . He did that twice. I had to go cut all my hair off to make it right again. I didn\u2019t press charges because he begged me not to. I never have and i should have 100s of times. The sheriff has asked me to. They have pictures of bruises all over me and broken fingernails. Then have the Snapchat of him cutting my hair. He posted all my hair. I wanted extensions in my hair because I miss my hair being lovely and long and I did it and he talked so much crap to me about it until I took it out. I told him how much it would make me happy and he took it all away from me. Made me feel so worthless and empty. He made me throw away my clothes and underwear. He made me do so much but he has done nothing. He lets me know DAILY I am nothing and he tried turning my girls against me by telling them so much they don\u2019t need to know. He is a awful person. I want to get away. I keep myself alive because I love my children so much. They are keeping my feet planted on this earth. They are innocent and beautiful souls. They are my EVERYTHING!!!! I don\u2019t know what to do. We share this house and he won\u2019t leave. He makes it all my fault. I wish I could post screenshots of his texts but I won\u2019t. But if I don\u2019t answer my phone he threatens me with other women but if he didn\u2019t answer it\u2019s just oh well. I don\u2019t talk to him like he talks to me. He talks crap about EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN talk crap about and he constantly throws my cheating in my face but can\u2019t take me talking about him. I need advice on how to hell to handle this. I\u2019m scared. Please.",

         "selftext": "My entire life has basically gone to Hell in the past two months. My ex was treating me like absolute crap, ended that, while dealing with her threats of suicide if I went through with it, she never did it but shut off her phone as soon as I ended it, so I spent the entire night worrying that I made her kill herself which hurt me like hell, she ended up turning everyone around me against me. I got bombarded with questions, got bullied for things I didn't do. Nearly got the police involved because she basically started telling people I sexually abused her. I found someone who I thought would be better for me and who would actually love me, she cheated on me within the first 2 weeks of the relationship, ended that. Stayed lonely and single for a few weeks after that, fell in love with someone else, we dated for maybe 3 weeks before she told me she wanted to stay friends. Realized that I'll be alone basically my entire life, no one, no matter who they are, will ever f**king love me back except for the one day I decide to stop loving. I'll pass up my chance in fear of getting hurt again and again. That first person that made me think she killed herself made me worry about that MORE THAN ONCE before then and it was f**king traumatizing to the point that I developed my own mental illnesses, now I'm stuck being a depressed, suicidal fat pile of crap that would be better off dead and people still think it's a good idea to pile on more stress. It's as if my obvious cries for help are never heard. People see my glassy eyes. People see the occasional tear roll down my face because I have so much built up that I can't even hold in so much as a tear.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My entire life has basically gone to Hell in the past two months. My ex was treating me like absolute crap, ended that, while dealing with her threats of suicide if I went through with it, she never did it but shut off her phone as soon as I ended it, so I spent the entire night worrying that I made her kill herself which hurt me like hell, she ended up turning everyone around me against me. I got bombarded with questions, got bullied for things I didn&amp;#39;t do. Nearly got the police involved because she basically started telling people I sexually abused her. I found someone who I thought would be better for me and who would actually love me, she cheated on me within the first 2 weeks of the relationship, ended that. Stayed lonely and single for a few weeks after that, fell in love with someone else, we dated for maybe 3 weeks before she told me she wanted to stay friends. Realized that I&amp;#39;ll be alone basically my entire life, no one, no matter who they are, will ever f&lt;strong&gt;king love me back except for the one day I decide to stop loving. I&amp;#39;ll pass up my chance in fear of getting hurt again and again. That first person that made me think she killed herself made me worry about that MORE THAN ONCE before then and it was f&lt;/strong&gt;king traumatizing to the point that I developed my own mental illnesses, now I&amp;#39;m stuck being a depressed, suicidal fat pile of crap that would be better off dead and people still think it&amp;#39;s a good idea to pile on more stress. It&amp;#39;s as if my obvious cries for help are never heard. People see my glassy eyes. People see the occasional tear roll down my face because I have so much built up that I can&amp;#39;t even hold in so much as a tear. I&amp;#39;m so damn tired of my life, I just wish it would somehow give me even a sliver of hope or just end already. I don&amp;#39;t feel any self-worth and I&amp;#39;ve lost all humanity to the point that the concept of death is the only thing that can bring a smile to my face.

         "selftext": "I have always suffered from depression and anxiety from a young age but have never felt the way I did after leaving Korea. When I was stationed in Korea we had a Curfew and needed to be back in our place of residence from 1-5 a.m. after 11 months and only being a month away from leaving and being stationed back at Fort Bragg my unit decided it was time for me to go to a promotion board. I stayed in for four weeks straight and studied as I saw myself staying in the Army for some time. The promotion board finally came and I nailed it and I have never been happier. This was a Wednesday so on Friday my closest friends and fellow soldiers decided to surprise me and take me out for a few drinks since I have denied them my company for the last month. We ended up staying out past curfew...not on purpose we just lost track of time. I noticed and proceeded to tell my friends that we were in the wrong part of Korea and needed to get out of the city for the night or we would get caught. They asked me to sit down as it was to late to anyways. I advised my friends that we should leave right then and there and they trusted me. We didn\u2019t get two feet out the door before being stopped by Korean Police escorted by an Army captain looking for soldiers out after curfew. We all got in trouble of course. After just passing the promotion board 48 hours prior to be eligible to be a sergeant I was  demoted to an E1 with 45 days extra duty. Due to my time in service I needed to be an E4 by the time I hit 6 years and with my time in service I would only need 6 months to reach E4 once again. I realized that I would hit 6 years five months into my punishment which would relieve me of service and end up being sent home. I fought for my right and ended up getting a meeting with a 2 star General to plead my case and ask to not be relieved of service. (NOTE: I had never been in trouble prior to this incident). I was a decent soldier and worked hard to get where I was. The general denied my appeal and said I was not fit for duty and sent me home. My entire career in the military means nothing and I feel nothing but sadness when I look back at a time that should have been my best years in life. I\u2019m literally in my bed right now about to go to bed and decided to pick up my phone and scroll through Facebook and ended up seeing the article stating that they removed the curfew permanently. This has sent me into an anxiety attack and I feel the sadness creeping in. Knowing that I lost everything for something that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore is mind blowing. I know this post is long but I just needed an outlet because I can fee my heart beating and it feels like it\u2019s going to blow out my chest. This incident has definitely caused me to have PTSD as I can\u2019t watch military movies anymore and I no longer hang any military plaques or medals in my home. Everything about the military saddens me as it makes me fee that I failed myself, my family, my fellow soldiers where 1 other was also relieved from service and my pride. The military was everything to me and because I was out late I was kicked out. I was 30 years old and celebrating. It was a simple mistake and I lost everything I ever worked for due to a curfew that no longer exist. I literally feel sick to my stomach. It has been two years since I was relieved of service and I still have nightmares, panic attacks and have been suicidal. I don\u2019t know what to do but just keep typing....I\u2019m now 33 and this makes me as sad as ever......",

The reason for that it because whenever I talk to someone I just try to hide the fact that I am also they dint have to pity me or worry about me and I even to it with counselors so they cant really diagnose me with it. So basically the reason I believe to why I became how I am is because when I was younger like younger than 6 young my dad used to beat me my mom and my brother and all of that caused me to start pulling my hair out in 1st grade this caused me to have no real friends my entire life even now and my dad whenever I would cut my hair he would punish me by beating me and doing haircut punishments this caused to to get severely bullied my entire life. But I had coping methods I started coping my doing good work and being the top student in the district at that time. That was until middle school when everyone started doing drugs and I would have to do peoples homework or else they would beat me up. This caused my grades to go down and my dad would start beating me more severely. And the thing with depression and ADHD is that I dont know how but when I am around people I just dot act overly hyper but when I am alone i start moving around like crazy some of the time the moving can last for up to around 8 to 9 minutes. But as of now I'm 16 still kinda pull my hair but since I've stopped my anxiety has gone through the roof and I now have no friends and the people I try to hang out with make fun of me daily and am now an f student I heard one of my teachers call me a failure when he thought I wasn't there.",

Maybe someone here might relate and understand me. English is not my fort\u00e9, so please bear with me.\n\nI havent tried going to any any Mental Health Doctors since its too expensive and from where I was brought up to, mental health is something to laugh about. Something that they just heard, known, but not really, put in their mind into.\n\nSince I was a kid, as early as I can remember, Ive been dreaming of dying. Im not really in good terms with my family at that time. Im the youngest one, next to me is my brother, who's one my enemy, and there's my eldest sister, who became my second mom.\nI know its normal for siblings to fight, but on what I have experienced, I think its the biggest factor why I never wanted to live. I believe I was only 6 or 7 maybe younger, and I always thought to myself that no one ever love me other than my sister.\n\nAs I grew older, the fights never went away. Adding the physical and verbal abuse from my parents. We go to church every Sunday. That is also why I loathe my parents before, since how can they 'praise God', lift up their hands and cry before the Lord, when after we go home. They will start saying foul words and hurt their kids so bad. My mom even said to my face that she regret bringing me to this world, that she shouldve killed me when I was still a baby. My dad, tried took advantages of me, attempted to sexually abuse me. My brother, always hated me. When I was in 6th grade, before the graduation, he punched me several times on the face, so when I went to school the next day. Half of my face was full of bruise. No one ever helped me. There was even one pastor, who gained my trust, I thought he will really help me out, but in the end, he aswell tried to take advantage of my young mind, trying to do sex over the phone, but he never succeeded on touching me.\n\nFrom then, I started hurting my self. Bit by bit, praying every night for God to take me. (My thoughts are jumbled, I cant tell my stories in order, sorry). \nI know its a sin to take one's life. Thats why I just pray for him give me some illness that will just kill me. Whenever I ride the bus or anything, there's always the hope for me to be in an accident. It would be freedom. Until now, I really dont know why would God let someone like me to live. Why He would protect me from every danger. There were lots and lots of accident around me, lots of people die every day, but why cant it be me? Why do I need to keep on living, there are other people that is more worthy to live. So why save me? I just wanted to disappear. I just wanted to die. Why cant he let me die.",

Felt like I had been standing on solid concrete for like two days. Just felt like I was standing on the bones of my feet. No cushion, no nothing. As the years went on it got worse and started to rise up from my feet all the way to my thighs. Its constant and horrible. It never goes away. Never eases. My doc put me on morphine, it helped to take the edge off. But nothing else. I lost my insurance at 21 so I can no longer see a proper doctor or any specialists. I am now 23, one month away from being 24.. But I'm scared I wont make it until then. In the past five months I have had pancreatitis four times.\nFeels like I'm bout to have it again...\nI've spent a 37 days in the hospital over the past five months. I just.. Don't know what to do.

Otherwise anywhere and everywhere I&amp;#39;m like one of those Ikea tools that come in the box to build the thing and then get forgoten in a drawer because there are actual tools that are far better than me. I am the worlds disposable tool...and I feel like I want to dispose of the trash...the useless...me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

When he told me about it, he had already tried a couple meds that didn\u2019t seem to do anything but was finally on one that was seemingly working and he said he was feeling more like himself.

I suspect it is partly due to finances and partly due to him wanting to feel more in control of his mental health.

         "selftext": "Hey all. Hope everyone's staying warm and fighting the good fight this December. \n\nFor context- I started taking antidepressants (Prozac 20mg) this past summer, and for the last 5 months things had been looking somewhat better. Progress, at the least!\n\nHowever, this past weekend I realized I've been in the throes of a pretty rough depressive episode, my first such episode ever since starting the medication. I'm not surprised per se, because life comes in ups and downs and it's my emotional reaction to finals and a stressful semester coming to a close (I'm a third-year undergrad student). \n\nBut I've realized something- I'm hardly any closer to overcoming my soul-crushing loneliness than I was 5 months ago. For me, loneliness is the major focus of my depression. My most prevalent and hostile automatic thoughts revolve around the question: \"Am I going to feel this lonely for the rest of my life?\" Because I feel pretty suckishly lonely, and have been for the past 4 years. I don't have a ton of social anxiety per se... it's more that I float between states of either not feeling like I need to interact with people at all, or being horribly lonely and sad. I have friendly acquaintances/classmates and maybe a few people I hang out with once every two weeks or so, but no best friends or friend groups. Most of the time I do my own thing, and it's fine until all of the sudden the loneliness hits and being alone is suddenly an excruciating experience.\n\nBeing in college has helped a little by being able to surround myself constantly with people, enough to keep the loneliness somewhat at bay. But starting this semester I've been living off campus, and having a single in a 4bd apartment has been a double-edged sword. For all the luxuries of having my own space, lately I've felt more and more trapped and isolated.\n\nPeople have recommended taking up a hobby or other creative outlets, but I'm currently a theatre major in college and so my career essentially IS my creative outlet. And while I've tried to solve the loneliness by throwing myself into working on my career, it's left me burnt out, socially isolated, and more depressed than I've been in months. When I keep busy, things feel fine, but it's during the slow moments when I start feeling lonely, trapped, and on the verge of despair.\n\nAt the end of this long ramble, I guess I'm trying to ask for help and support. It's something I've been working on this past year (reaching out for help when I need it, instead of trying to suck it up and push past the pain). So if any of you wonderful human beings have tips or advice for how I can make more of a concerted effort to include friends in my life, I'm all ears. \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019m coming forth with a heavy heart, shame and guilt despite having taken all actions possible to reconcile with those involved.\n\nLet me first start, I\u2019m m(23) now, overworked but I\u2019m dealing with it. Years ago in my second to last year of high-school I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety, since then the diagnosis changed to BP2, and through therapy, medication(which I have been free of for a little over 2 year\u2019s now I\u2019ve been diagnosed with BPD.  In a general sense I pose no threat to anyone, in a general sense I am safe and a contributing human to society, but ultimately I understand the causes of my antisocial behaviour and unfortunately have just learnt the consequences of them.\n\nThe first time I hurt someone was verbally, in my senior year I was being bullied by an individual in class and ripped them to shreds on a personal level until they cried as a result. My teacher at the time (ironically, psychology class) was in disbelief to what she had witnessed.\n\nI\u2019ve never hurt anyone again intentionally, I have however written things more personal and horrible, life destroying pieces of writing, research and evidence of wrongdoing mixed with anecdotes and my own bias to which I never release, but instead use them to vent. I have taken frustration out on myself, in playing music, in working out, in driving mountain roads, in isolation, and of course, the continuing bitch, substance abuse. Whilst I have gone periods of weeks, months without the substance due to not having access, and during the time I felt no withdrawal or hunger for it, the second I\u2019m home again I fall into a vicious ritual of working, coming home, going out to engage in physical activity, getting gluttonous amounts of food, abusing a substance when I get home to stomach all the food, purging after I slave away half assed responding to people or just blankly observing YouTube, I can\u2019t game anymore due to lack of joy. Not only is this expensive, harmful and selfish but it\u2019s in direct opposition of my goals of being healthy, I don\u2019t want to do it, but every time I\u2019m coming home my mind knows what it\u2019s going to do. This cycle may sometimes in my more manic moods require me to buy outlandish things, play musical instruments or inflict self harm, however the latter is rarer now.\n\nThis is all okay for now I suppose and I apologise for my long-winded ways of telling the stories the real point of this is to get it out there what I did, because I don\u2019t seem to be able to turn to anyone right now out of shame, and I don\u2019t have the ability to see my psych until next year. I\u2019m stuck lying to everyone close which hurts me even more.\n\nI try to hurt myself when I drink too much.\nI very recently hurt someone close to me when I drank even more than that.\nI am inconsolable in these times, I have suicidal ideations, and express them verbally.\nI no longer feel control.\nI don\u2019t drink regularity but in my last week of my holiday I went self destructive again. I\u2019ve committed now to sobriety from alcohol until feb.\n\nThis regent occurrence when I hurt someone was dreadful, they were shocked, and rightfully so, they\u2019re now scared of me, and there\u2019s not much I can do, and as someone who enjoys being able to control things around me it is agony. I accept my wrongdoing, and have been able to speak to the victim of my outburst, to which they were able to fill in my blank parts of the evening, which made me sick. \n\nI was in a bar, karaoke bar after a heavy night of drinking with these people, 3 friends, one who cares for me, the one I hurt. Too many drinks had been consumed and the friend that knew me and cared about me had queued some anxty songs that are guilty pleasures of mine, music hits me hard, some songs bring goosebumps to me without fail no matter my situation.\nAfter a few of these songs they noticed I wasn\u2019t doing alright, was hunched over still drinking until I finished, and began cutting my face with my nail. When they noticed they stopped me, but they described me as gleefully doing it but not in a good way or state at all.  I did more and worse, there\u2019s still remnants on my body, for the next few days they were vile and I couldn\u2019t bear to look at myself, I wore a face mask and beanie to hide as much as possible (socially acceptable where I was). The person had to keep wiping up my face, and I unfortunately must admit that I liked that attention. They took me to the bathroom to try calm me down, but as I said, i am inconsolable in this state. I tried to knock myself out and drown myself in the toilet, but they wouldn\u2019t let me, i apparently begged and pleaded for death, and they refused to leave me, I hit them. Their head hit the bathroom wall. Not hard apparently. But to me,  someone who has never laid a hand on someone ever in my life, it is despicable to learn of. They went out and told my friends, to which they exiled me, fair enough. I tripped down the stairs of the narrow karaoke bar. I ran and threw my possessions everywhere, thank goodness I found my passport in the waking hours of the following day. I passed out on the street somewhere I don\u2019t remember, I remember feeling a lot of pain, I remember a group of girls helping me up, and I remember laughing a lot. I then remember stumbling back to try and find my friends. The ones who exiled me still refused me, the one I hurt was clearly fearful, butThey returned my jacket and phone, my rings I had given them at the start of the karaoke bar but then asked me to leave them alone and they can\u2019t talk to me. I understood it but my rational brain was gone. I kept my distance in front of them as they tried to leave, making sure to keep my hands down to not appear threatening whilst pleading for forgiveness, through bloodied attempts at self expression. I eventually accepted I couldn\u2019t do anything as I had done to much and gave up trying to apologise.\n\nI had to stumble around asking strangers in a non English speaking country to help me make a police report for my missing stuff. By luck a man lent me enough money to get home and survive for the coming day\u2019s until my flight home.\n\nToday marks 12 days since that incident, only last night did I get the full story from the person I hurt, I\u2019ve been very cautious and giving a lot of room to them so that they can heal in their own way. I asked them directly if they are scared of me, the response was simply \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard \u201c.\n\nI learnt my demons that I thought  I dealt with many moons ago, though through declining severity diagnosis are still laying dormant, and alcohol is what will draw it out. The other substance doesn\u2019t bring out the same demon, but I want to tackle that one, but can\u2019t seem to do it out of fear of being alone with my thoughts and doing \u201cnothing\u201d when I\u2019m home alone.\n\nI\u2019m guilty, self-hate-filled, and broken, I sustained injuries resulting in a fracture to my dominant hand as a result of likely hitting a wall due to the nature of the break.\n\nI just needed to tell someone. I\u2019m sorry. I need help.",

I accept my wrongdoing, and have been able to speak to the victim of my outburst, to which they were able to fill in my blank parts of the evening, which made me sick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in a bar, karaoke bar after a heavy night of drinking with these people, 3 friends, one who cares for me, the one I hurt. Too many drinks had been consumed and the friend that knew me and cared about me had queued some anxty songs that are guilty pleasures of mine, music hits me hard, some songs bring goosebumps to me without fail no matter my situation.\nAfter a few of these songs they noticed I wasn\u2019t doing alright, was hunched over still drinking until I finished, and began cutting my face with my nail. When they noticed they stopped me, but they described me as gleefully doing it but not in a good way or state at all.  I did more and worse, there\u2019s still remnants on my body, for the next few days they were vile and I couldn\u2019t bear to look at myself, I wore a face mask and beanie to hide as much as possible (socially acceptable where I was). The person had to keep wiping up my face, and I unfortunately must admit that I liked that attention. They took me to the bathroom to try calm me down, but as I said, i am inconsolable in this state. I tried to knock myself out and drown myself in the toilet, but they wouldn\u2019t let me, i apparently begged and pleaded for death, and they refused to leave me, I hit them. Their head hit the bathroom wall. Not hard apparently. But to me,  someone who has never laid a hand on someone ever in my life, it is despicable to learn of. They went out and told my friends, to which they exiled me, fair enough. I tripped down the stairs of the narrow karaoke bar. I ran and threw my possessions everywhere, thank goodness I found my passport in the waking hours of the following day. I passed out on the street somewhere I don\u2019t remember, I remember feeling a lot of pain, I remember a group of girls helping me up, and I remember laughing a lot. I then remember stumbling back to try and find my friends. The ones who exiled me still refused me, the one I hurt was clearly fearful, butThey returned my jacket and phone, my rings I had given them at the start of the karaoke bar but then asked me to leave them alone and they can\u2019t talk to me. I understood it but my rational brain was gone. I kept my distance in front of them as they tried to leave, making sure to keep my hands down to not appear threatening whilst pleading for forgiveness, through bloodied attempts at self expression. I eventually accepted I couldn\u2019t do anything as I had done to much and gave up trying to apologise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to stumble around asking strangers in a non English speaking country to help me make a police report for my missing stuff. By luck a man lent me enough money to get home and survive for the coming day\u2019s until my flight home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today marks 12 days since that incident, only last night did I get the full story from the person I hurt, I\u2019ve been very cautious and giving a lot of room to them so that they can heal in their own way. I asked them directly if they are scared of me, the response was simply \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard \u201c.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learnt my demons that I thought  I dealt with many moons ago, though through declining severity diagnosis are still laying dormant, and alcohol is what will draw it out. The other substance doesn\u2019t bring out the same demon, but I want to tackle that one, but can\u2019t seem to do it out of fear of being alone with my thoughts and doing \u201cnothing\u201d when I\u2019m home alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m guilty, self-hate-filled, and broken, I sustained injuries resulting in a fracture to my dominant hand as a result of likely hitting a wall due to the nature of the break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just needed to tell someone. I\u2019m sorry. I need help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "  \n\nDepression\n\nI am depressed. Every day I wake up and within minutes the mind monster has me with its hatred. I say its hatred, but really the hatred is all mine. I hate myself. At least that is what I tell myself over and over again every day. I try to escape with sleep. I also do positivity meditations, whilst functionally useless, they distract me from the hateful pressure in my own skull. I want to make a hole in my head to let the pressure out. I like that someone else tells me I am ok, because I struggle so hard to tell myself that. I recognised a few years ago that I do not think positively at all. I am full of self-criticism and loathing. So I figured if I cannot give myself positive thoughts then maybe I can listen to some and it will take root and perhaps grow thought patterns that are helpful and compassionate to myself. This has not been the case. I have listened to these saccharine statements for years and there is no improvement. Everyday I wake to the barrage of self-hatred. And the odd thing is I have never done anything that logically deserves self-loathing. I have always tried to help others, I dedicated my younger life to helping kids at risk, I volunteered to help others, have volunteered at an orphanage for kids with special needs, have been there for friends going through difficult times and given food, support and comfort to friends and family. I have done everything I can to prove to the hatred in my head that I am not a bad person. To be clear I have never murdered anyone, raped or abused anyone \u2013 although I have been subjected to abuse and abandonment as a child and was raped as a young adult. Sometimes I wish some one would just kill me; it would save me from having to do it. \n\nI have spent years and years in therapy. From the age of 19 I sought therapy after realising that beating myself daily with a thick leather belt was not overly caring of myself \u2013 although I had framed the self-abuse as \u2018motivation\u2019. I told someone what I did and their horror at my casual abuse of myself was shocking to me. I really didn\u2019t get it at all until I saw it in someone else\u2019s eyes. I then started therapy and self-help courses for years and none of it has worked. None. I despise myself as much as I did back then if not more so because now I have an entire adulthood of struggling with these issues and failing to resolve them. \n\nFor nearly thirty years I have struggled with this poisonous self-hatred and I have got nowhere. In fact, it has only worsened. I am 46 years old now and cannot find work. I feel like I am utterly useless. Every morning I wake up after too little sleep to only have a barrage of recrimination descend on me within moments of opening my eyes and ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN, PREFERABLY PERMANANTLY. \n\nI send out my resume and am lucky to get a rejection. Mostly I am ignored. It has been a couple years now since I held down a proper job. A friend got me a contract, a few months ago and I delivered it, it was a huge project, which really should have gone to a content creation team to complete, I got it done, but the stress was unbelievable. I woke two or three times a night in a cold sweat, but I worked my arse off, got a couple aspects of the project done by contractors and delivered on time. Once it was done, I collapsed, utterly exhausted. I have been pretty much useless since then. \n\nThe only reason I have not opened that hole in my head to let out the pressure is my girl. She is literally the best thing that has happened to me in my life. I could not subject her to the fallout of my suicide. Maybe all that therapy made enough space for her to show up in my life. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t feel this way, I shouldn\u2019t hate myself so much, but I do, and I don\u2019t think it will ever change. I spent my whole life so far trying to stem the tide of self-hatred, but I can\u2019t hold back the ocean with my bare hands.",
