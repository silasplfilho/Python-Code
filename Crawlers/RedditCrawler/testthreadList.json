I am new here and finally decided to make a move and try helping myself out.\n\nI am in my late thirties and struggle with anxiety and depression. My earliest signs of struggle come from being abducted as a child and reuniting with my family years later. I\u2019ve worked hard my whole life to create something special for myself but have always struggled with loving myself. I am an introvert who has cut ties with people I once knew back in my early twenties around the time I met my wife. I am feeling very alone and often think of myself as a burden. I have reason to be happier but I just can\u2019t seem to be most of the time. I have an amazing wife, great job and two parents and a brother who love me; yet I feel like all eyes are on me most of the time and it makes me feel so uneasy.\n\nI have reached out to a professional for the first time in April 2016 (I should have done this earlier, I know) and am worried about where I am mentally. Started to feel taking daily meds will only help with something short term. I am not even sure I can repair anything inside of me that has been feeling this way. Depending on meds only helps with so much. I feel a need to do more but suffer from loving myself enough to get it going again.\n\nFor anyone else out there struggling, my heart is with you. We can wonder why and how all day long but for just one second remember we are right here, right now. Chin up and let\u2019s do what we always do.",

I\u2019ve worked hard my whole life to create something special for myself but have always struggled with loving myself. I am an introvert who has cut ties with people I once knew back in my early twenties around the time I met my wife. I am feeling very alone and often think of myself as a burden. I have reason to be happier but I just can\u2019t seem to be most of the time. I have an amazing wife, great job and two parents and a brother who love me; yet I feel like all eyes are on me most of the time and it makes me feel so uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have reached out to a professional for the first time in April 2016 (I should have done this earlier, I know) and am worried about where I am mentally. Started to feel taking daily meds will only help with something short term. I am not even sure I can repair anything inside of me that has been feeling this way. Depending on meds only helps with so much. I feel a need to do more but suffer from loving myself enough to get it going again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone else out there struggling, my heart is with you. We can wonder why and how all day long but for just one second remember we are right here, right now. Chin up and let\u2019s do what we always do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But something weird happened tru smoking weed i started to think about what i do and the consequnces it has for me short/mid/long term. So with like 16 i really excelled in school and got everything right school wise. ( I am (luckily) pretty smart but lazy af). Sadly my friends didnt make this change school wise , so they all are more or less criminals and doing money with drugs.\n\nSo i dont really have the most stable social enviroment , i never had a girlfriend ( im pretty good looking but never wanted to) untill like 3 years ago we met and it just clicked i guess  she understood myself better then i ever will probably. She broke up with me like 6 Months ago when i was in a pretty depressive state of mind for reasons i dont even know anymore ( probably even no reason)\n\nI moved out of my parents home pretty soon after the breakup , just couldnt stand that room and all the memories and i had the feeling i needed to escape.\n\nSo i got a pretty nice Loft 11 Floor nice view all fine , everyone of my old/new friends is like you gotta be so happy man no problems bla bla bla. \n\nBut here is the problem i am so unbelievable unhappy and besides missing my Ex i cant even describe why. I got all the materialistic things i thought would make me happy but somehow i feel i am farer from reaching happiness then i have ever been. \n\nI am not looking for pity of any kind , but like some serious tips do i have a mental illnes , do i need to stop smoking weed what can i do to get happy again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThx for reading and sorry for my shaky english.

So I'm just sat here a little bit worried about you all.\n\nWinter is horrible. By the end of winter I'm usually ready to kill myself. March is an emergency time where I always need to kill myself, go to a doctor or have Reiki (which surprisingly worked rather well for me, even though it sounds dumb as shit) but this year is the first year I've taken anti-depressants properly (consistantly) because I usually take them, feel okay and think I don't need them anymore. I also have a tendency to forget to take them. So anyway, I don't have those usual winter blues. \n\nSo, if you're feeling low today. Ride it out. Force yourself to eat a healthy meal, drag yourself out for a walk or run, or just crawl into bed, pull the duvet over your head and just lay there until you feel slightly better. \n\nThere are plenty of books that have helped me along the way over my past 25 years of suffering from depression that have given me different ways of thinking and dealing with things, including The Power of Now, Conversations with God and the Way of the Peaceful Warrior.   \n\n\nI hope you feel better soon. And things do get better in life. If you're not taking medication, try it. Also go get a blood test to see if you're lacking in any vitamins that might be contributing to how you're feeling - believe me, I suffered from a vitamin D deficiency after giving birth and before I knew what it was I was in so much pain I was ready to kill myself if I found out I was going to have to live with it forever. It's surprised me just how much damage a deficiency in a single vitamin could do.  Try a water fast or a wholefood diet for a time (two things I've done that left me feeling the best mentally I've ever felt. I'd do it more, but you know...life and willpower and that)\n\nAnd I know you think no one cares about you, but they do. Your family do, and your friends do. Hell, I even care about you. I don't want anyone to feel the way you do right now.\n\n I know sometimes it feels like people don't give a shit but we're fragile creatures. People have their own stuff and struggles to deal with. Many of them probably with depression feeling like you don't care about them.  But people do care about you, and if you need to then reach out to someone.   \n\n\nI know so many people as aquaintances but not friends, and I can tell you now if any of them needed to talk to me, or just spend some time with someone I'd be their in a heartbeat. The problem is that people don't reach out. So do, reach out to someone. Remember that your life isn't a hopeless pit of misery. You are ill. Allow yourself to rest and recover.",

         "selftext": "So i don't know where to begin...\n\nIn the beginning of the last school year everything was going well. It was a new school, 10th grade, some old friends and made some new. Found myself (atleast as i tought back then) a girl that i liked and who liked me. I had no depression or anything like that so i was allways trying to cheer her up and so on. We had a good thing going but then about half a year in i learnt (not from her) that she actually had a bf but that she still liked me also. So we decided to just be friends and not make a big dealt cuz her bf knew of us and sayd as long it wasn't anything too much it would be ok (he was away for 6 months in service so he sayed he gets why). But then things started to get shitty. Her friends pressured her not to talk to me and wrote some letters to me trying to scare me. So soon she started to hate me for reasons i did not know at that time. So came along summer and depression. I had just lost my best and most trusted friend for reasons i back then didn't really know. Throughout summer i managed to get somewhat over it and was starting to get over the depression. Also yes i do have other friends but they are more for like gaming and stuff not trust.\n\nThen comes new school year. Before the first day she wrote to me and sayed that \"I still like you and want to be friends. I won't have any old friends and i still want to talk to  you.\" So for whatever reason i agreed on it and well things started to look up again. About a week later she also came clear why we had a fight and everything. Then we had two great school trips together. After the second trip she started to ignore me again. Then i learnt her bf had broken up with her, so i tried my best to support her if she needed. Things again were going great and she liked me even more (it was back in November 2019).\n\nSo fast forward to today. I went to speak with her after the holidays and see what's up. Well comes out she had found a new boy who liked her but she's still iffy on him. Well done me. I taught if i would give her time and not try anything that maybe we could be something then (i had made some plans to go somewhere in February), because i knew she still liked me very much as i was apparently her first choice  for prom before that and by the way she acts around me and in classes (or it might just be me).\nWell, this whole shit has boosted my depression now and i don't know what to do anymore. And i feel bad cuz i partly blame her new friend for it. She has been provoking her to write to other guys (immediately after the breakup) and do stuff she would not come to by herself and now because this new guy is also her friend she seems to be pleased with herself and smuggs any time they are near me. \n\nI'm sorry it's a long one but i just didn't know what to do so i thought venting here where no-one knows me (so i feel kinda safe) might help. Sorry if there are some typos, english isn't my main language.\n\nBtw i know i was dumb hoping for anything after the first time cuz there has now been like 4 times we've had a fight and not a small one, but every time she comes back around and wants to talk to me for whatever reason.\n\nHappy 2020 my ass.",

Like, really hard. It\u2019s not to the extreme or anything but I\u2019ve always gone out of my way to take care of those around me. Whether it be family, friends coworkers, or someone who may just need a hand \u2014 I will do what it takes to ensure that they are happy. Because, honestly, it makes me happy knowing that I have made a positive influence in someone else\u2019s life. That what I have done has made a difference. I have fought for friendships, for relationships (intimate and familial), for students to achieve their goals \u2014 almost everything that has needed a support system of some kind, I\u2019ve done my best to be it. \n\nWith that being said, it sucks when I\u2019m unable to accomplish that goal, and it takes a toll on me. I hurts because I know that what I tried to do didn\u2019t help. It didn\u2019t make the impact I would have liked. It didn\u2019t make a difference. And that doesn\u2019t make me happy. It hurts sometimes. But I\u2019ve never given up. It\u2019s always been my goal to be there for those who need it, regardless of what it may take. I just strove to be better next time for whoever may need it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until two years ago that I began a relationship that genuinely made ME happy. That took away the pain and sadness that I\u2019ve felt after so many failed attempts at being there for others. This is something that I wanted for myself, someone that I wanted to spend my future with. Someone that I put everything I had into. The good, the bad, the ugly \u2014 all of what made me who I was. Everything. And I failed. And it hurts.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s not the relationship that has me feeling this way. (Don\u2019t let me lie to you - it\u2019s playing a huge part but it\u2019s not the overlying reason.) I\u2019ve told her before that I wanted it and I\u2019ll do what it takes to make it work. But if I\u2019m not good enough, I\u2019m not good enough. I understand that. What has me feeling this way is that for years I have tried so hard to ensure that those around me are taken care of. That they are okay and if they needed something, I was there. I didn\u2019t think about what I wanted, what would make me happy. I wouldn\u2019t ask for things that I couldn\u2019t get myself and I never wanted to be a burden to someone else. What has me feeling this way is that for (what seems like) the first time in my life, I wanted something. I wanted something to work out because it was with someone that I was passionate about, someone who I worked my ass off for day in and day out to see the smile on her face and to hear her laugh. This was someone that I supported with through the lowest times in her life and the highest. This was someone I love. What has me feeling this way is that for this first time, I was pursuing my own happiness. And I failed. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being a bitch about this. I probably am. But after so many times of putting myself out there for others, for fighting for things and people that I cared so deeply about, my body is tired and weak. My body actually hurts sometimes. I\u2019m mentally exhausted and psychologically broken. My sleep schedule is off. I eat a meal a day if someone forces it down my throat. I feel empty inside, dreading every morning, praising every night. Going through the motions of the day with minimal interactions with others. Like I\u2019m in a state of purgatory, wandering with no destination in sight. I\u2019ve lost sight of who I am and what I strive to accomplish. I finally did something for me. I pursued and worked towards something that I wanted. Yet after trying my best for both those around me and for myself, it feels like I\u2019ve amounted to damn near nothing. The differences I have made have been minimal, the happiness I should have for myself is borderline nonexistent, and every day is a struggle to keep up this facade of being the positive spirit in the household or in the hallways or in the gym.\n\nI\u2019ve been like this for two months now, trying to figure myself out and work my way out of this. But in a sentence: I give up. I can\u2019t help others. I can\u2019t help myself. I don\u2019t even want to bother any more. And everything is looking bleak. I feel unfit to be who I want to be in this world. That what I do won\u2019t make the difference that I would like it to. That my efforts will continue to be in vain and there\u2019s no reason to push for something that won\u2019t come to pass anyway. That my happiness will never come to pass.\n\nLike I said before, I\u2019m just going through the motions everyday. But I\u2019m about to tap out.",

I\u2019m trying to figure out what causes snaps, why it\u2019s happening more often now (I\u2019m on holiday after GCSEs and don\u2019t feel as stressed as before, but haven\u2019t really gone back to normal) and how to stop it. Help, please? I keep hurting myself when I snap, and with college starting soon, I don\u2019t want too many obvious scars/bruises or to hurt anyone there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So I had him home with me for the past 3 weeks and they were quite a blur. With making arrangements , the holidays, and just this past weekend , we had a benefit for my father. Now he goes back to work today. He unfortunately works 2nd shift. So it\u2019s not that I\u2019m at work while he is too. I come home to an empty place and I\u2019m usually really good with my alone time. I\u2019m so used to second shift , but these three weeks have been so nice. I haven\u2019t truly been alone since everything happened and I\u2019m just scared. Everyone says to go to my moms and stay busy. But the downside to this , I just want to stay home. Going anywhere right now gives me an unsettling feeling. I\u2019m not too sure what I\u2019m scared of.

         "selftext": "Hi, I'm studying illustration design at a university in Tokyo. A year ago i was diagnosed with major depression and been struggling for a while going on and off my medications. At first, I didn't realize that i have this condition. Probably because my best friend was there for me. She'd always asked me to go out for almost anything; Movies, shopping, anything. She's really smart, beautiful, and really cool! Eventually i started to develop feelings towards her. I used to clean my room regularly, since she liked going to my room so we can study and do projects together. Those were the most wonderful, fun days in my life.\n\nThen things changed.\nMy bestfriend (let's call her Kana), she moved to Australia. She realized that being an illustrator is not the career path she wanted to pursuit, So she moved to Melbourne to study patisserie instead. To be honest when she told me that she's going to move abroad, i was really sad and probably still am. Nevertheless, she's my bestfriend so i'm happy that she finally found her true passion. \nI realized that my time was running out, i had to confess to her or at least tell her how i feel. I'm not handsome at all, below average even. So i really never had the courage to tell girls about my feelings because deep down i already knew that i'm going to be rejected. But Kana, i really love her. I love her so much that i can't stop thinking about her. Time was not on my side, so i had to tell her right? \nI didn't.\n\nWe went to the airport, hugged for the last time as she cried in my arms. I had to let go and said \"go on now, you're going to miss your flight.\"\nI was already holding my tears when we waved at each other as she went through the gate. When she finally was out of sight, i went to smoke a cigarette and as i exhaled the smoke out of my mouth, tears started dropping out. People looked at me with confusion, but i didn't really care.\n\nDays after her departure went bleak, empty, and meaningless. Maybe i was just sad and this all will pass i thought. Yet, this persisted for so long. I started skipping classes, my body aches, and i was always tired! My bed was the most comfortable and 'safe' place for me. I started sleeping when the sun's out and waking up when the sun's down. And the dreams i was having, they were so nice. So nice that i don't want to wake up ever. I woke up everyday realizing that it was all just a dream and i'm back in this reality that sucks. I was always an emotional boy in my childhood, easy to cry and took things too personally sometimes. But i was never THIS sad. Every night i smoke my cigarettes while staring at the window thinking why am i so miserable. Eventually, my homeroom teacher noticed this and he confronted me about it. I told him all about what i've been dealing with. After hearing my explanation, he said that he's really sorry for what i've been through and he's willing to accompany me to meet a psychiatrist.",

When I tell my roommates about my barriers with being able to work right /now/ they judge me. I'm constantly walking on eggshells with them. I stay in my room all the time because it gives me comfort. They don't understand that though, and keep judging every thing I do. If I breath the wrong way and they'll get irritated.\n\nI'm not gonna lie and say that I haven't done anything wrong.. I was naive and leaned on them for support, thinking they'd be there for me until things were better. They've shared their food with me, bought treats and gifts for me, and have even given me advice. Even though those things are so incredible of them to do.. I've had to throw away all my furniture to move here because they didn't want the hassle of moving it, stuffed my whole life in a closet because my room is too small, which was forced on me because my roommate wanted my room since it has a bathroom (she has medical stuff she needed it for). No matter how I look at it... they've been manipulative, degrading, dismissive, and belittling. They have gone behind my back and making decisions without me, and refused to compromise with me while making me feel like I was wrong for even suggesting such a thing.\n\nThey use comments like \"just throw your cat out here, so what if they fight\" in complete disregard to how my kitty's anxiety and stress is, and \"you do nothing all day, and you can't even do the dishes and clean?\" when in reality 90% of the mess wouldn't be there if they just picked up after themselves. I'm constantly snapped at for not cleaning enough, providing enough, or doing enough with my life. Meanwhile they use my stuff freely like the dishes my big brother gave me which are now ruined. I can't even leave a small mess without having my roommates breathing down my neck. They're convinced I'm just a freeloader.. but I'm not! I just stay in my room because I'm comfortable there. When I'm not overwhelmed with depression, anxiety, and stress about home life, I'm working on stuff.\n\nI've just got back in school, just got a new doctor, started to get myself on a routine.. I felt like I've really been making progress in a lot of important things. They keep asking me to prove myself, and rolling their eyes at me when I defend my case. They've even gotten mad at me for using my savings to buy groceries after they cut me off from eating, I had no choice! Did they want me to starve? I was only trying to save for things like emergencies, and getting furniture like a dresser and bed sine I had to throw mine out...\n\nI trusted them when they said they had my back, that's why I came here with them thinking everything was going to work out.  They said I was like a sister to them... I've never tried to make life hard for them, I've tried to be responsible and considerate, and stay out of the way.. I've taken their advice even if I haven't always followed it, never asked for anything, offered to help with cleaning (help, not do it for them), bought some things when I could, gone to food banks, gotten into online classes, gotten into tutoring which hasn't started yet (waiting for them to assign a tutor), gotten a new doctor and plan to get referred to a psychologist and psychiatrist, all leading up to getting into disability and therapy to work through stuff. So why don't they take me seriously? This place is hell on my mental health though...\n\nThey've forced me apply for jobs, minimized what I'm going through, accused me of making fun of people with suicidal thoughts because I laughed (i laugh awkwardly when I'm nervous or uncomfortable) when I said something dark (didn't mean to let it slip out) after they stated there's nothing is wrong with me so I'd be the only one in the house to get drafted, and in general degraded me for practically everything they could humanly find wrong with me... it's tearing me apart.\n\nHow do they not see what they're doing..? It's so passive aggressive, I'm suffocating under the pressure.\n\nThey're acting like I've offended them, when I'm just trying to get in a better place long term!\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? I can't make things move faster..\n\nIdk.. can anyone recommend some coping advice through all of this? I know I'm never going to live up to their expectations, I've accepted that I'm just a failure in their eyes, but it's maddening when you can't escape it!\n\nEdit: Grammar",

I recently lost my great grandmother who raised me as my primary maternal figure and quit my second job after socially ostrazizing myself from everyone there. i'm usually pretty stand offish and god awful at talking to people but i would like to think there's a kind and better and more joyful side to me even if it doesn't come out as often anymore but due to lack of social skills i lasted about a week at my job before i caught people calling me an autist, retard, weird, etc, etc behind my back and it just kind of broke me on top of losing my grandmother just the other month i broke down and started to lose it and I've never felt this hopeless before. on top of that I live with my grandpa and my dad is using again like always nothing really ever changes on that front and i Like to think i'm numb to but I know deep down it's still affecting me in ways i can't fully understand right now without more life experience, My dad has been a severe alcoholic since around the age of 13 or so i've been told by my mom and it's just completely fucked him mentally and physically and he's never once acted like a proper father figure or parent I remember very early on maybe around the age of 8ish him coming home at 7pm just completely obliterated 15/10 drunk but that was by no means a new occurence at that point and thankfully i was never beat or abused but  seeing the person i wanted to look up to badly like that day after day week after week month after month year after year when i was so young made me feel like I had nothing and very early on made me realize that I had a stronger sense of reasoning and common sense then the one I was supposed to be learning from and looking up to and I can still remember being washed over by this strange feeling I couldn't put into words no matter how hard I try now.  I said before i was never abused or beat and i'm really thankful for that seeing some of the older generation in my family and what it did to them and how it shaped them but I remember always being scared and this feeling of tension in the house every time my dad was drunk it was some really odd kind of primal fear an uncertainty of outcome almost. To set scene a little at this point i was staying with my great grandparents, uncle, and dad who i lived with for probably a majority of my life at this point and one of the biggest interests me and my dad shared at this point were video games and I really loved the time I spend playing games with him, We used to play call of duty 3 splitscreen co-op and do this day I think those were some of the most fun days in my whole Life, He was actually really really good at call of duty maybe one of his crowning achievments in life  but I latched on to his skill in the game It let me have something to respect about him as pathetic as that feels to type but just having that feeling of a strong authorative paternal figure standing over me really fulfilled me at the time and I still look back upon those days of me and him laughing and having fun fondly but no matter what kind of little glimmer of hope bonding over games and the escapism games gave me from the situation the alcoholism always crept back in and with it my feelings of fear and uncertainty, I remember my dad being out one night and I was playing halo 3 with some of my best friends in my whole life  a couple of wich i'm even still in contact with today i even talked to one just today but I remember I heard the front door open and i heard my grandpa he was really really upset I think my dad may have managed to stay clean for month or two which happened every now and then but the relapse always came now matter how long after and i remember the yelling match started as always I just kept playing halo and turned off my mic and pretended or maybe convinced myself nothing was happening but then my dad came into the video game room which was down stairs and he sad down and started talking to me i can't really remember what about and I can't even begin to remember how i felt at the time that's still far beyond me at this point, but the conversation ended up coming to him asking me this question \"if somebody did something really really wrong to you do you think it's okay to hurt them\" I kind of just froze i didn't know who or what he was talking about i don't even know if he did with how drunk he was but I remember feeling that same primal fear and uncertanity i mentioned earlier and ran upstairs to my grandparents and when they asked what happened i told them nothing happened like always and I snuggeled in with my grandma and we watched crime dramas and went to bed. My great grandparents were both severe enablers of my father and my grandfather still is to this day he even just bought him some weed yesterday, I remember they would give him 100s of dollars a week to go out and party with and in some sick twisted way they thought they were helping him but I still can't wrap my head around how my grandpa can think that I remember also coming to the conclusion that no matter what happens i should never ever talk to my grandparents about my dads alcoholism and the screaming matches he and my grandpa would have not because of any particular negative experience but through learned reasoning my grandparents never brought it up, and the mood of everyone in the house when the severe drinking was going seemed so heavy and so dark and the time I can't properly put it into words but i remember not wanting to be the one to bring up it felt like it was a taboo action and the handful of times later into my teens i did bring it up I always ended up being the bad guy I the story they gave me was that my dad was incredibly sick and needed our help and love more than anything else. These are more recent memories now but there were times where my dad would do really good with his addiction and stay sober for months even close to half a year at some points but like It always happened the late night 2am door knock came i go downstairs check outside low and behold it's my dad and his girlfriend at the time showing up in the middle of the night completely shitfaced 15/10 drunk like the nights where he relapsed always were and at this point i was in my late teens 17 or 18 i think and I was able to handle these situations a little better I opened the door and the first thing he gives is the classic apology and tells me he's really sorry and ashamed I have to see him like this just the usual speel to get into the house for a week or so while he finds other people to leech off of I let him in and told him that he needed to shut the fuck up and go straight to bed and not make a scene, i told him my little brother had school in the morning and that if he caused a scene i would knock him out flat (i've actually never been in a real fight before i'm a pretty timid person but my emotions always flare when he's drunk and I needed control of the situationit) I actually managed to calm the situation down and i gained a lot of confidence from that, later on that same year a cop showed up at my house and said they were looking for my dad and later that day he comes home the living shit beat out of him and the police are looking for him for assault charges at this point i just kind of snapped and blew up and  this time it was me who instigated the screaming match in front of my little brother (kind of funny how the cycle works our like that) \n\n\n\ni'm really really tired and i've been typing for over an hour now and i've calmed down so i'm going to stop and sleep. I don't think i've ever shared most of this stuff with other people but if this giant wall of text i'm staring at is even remotely legible and you read it thanks o/",

I thought I could handle it, and just toughen myself through it, which I was doing so, my loving and caring girlfriend is an amazing help.  \n\n\nThe past two weeks, specifically the past week, its like my depression has doubled down, or maybe even more than that. I can't find anything enjoyable as much anymore, I'm stressing at work, and not being able to keep the bad things at the door like I'm supposed to at work, because the supported can sense it. I am struggling... physically with my girlfriend, she is loving and understanding but because I can't do like I used to, its stressing me out further. I am not on any medication because I wanted to beat this myself but can't, so I'm going to the GP to see if i can get some Antidepressants. However I've received a text from my boss, saying that she is worried about me and wants to talk to me before I start my shift... This is causing me more stress because I know what its about, and It is taking everything out of me not to just break down and collapse... I say I'm not at risk of hurting myself to others, especially my girlfriend, cause I made a promise to her that I was never going anywhere, I never want to hurt myself because I know how much it would hurt her... But the more this stress goes on, the more I'm worried I'm gonna slip. I dont know what to do.",

         "selftext": "I'm defeated and I don't want to be here any more. Every day i sleep in until the the last moment when I have to go to work or do some other activity that if I don't society will punish me. I spend a majority of my days groggy and solemn, but put on my best face for friends and coworkers. Every day I wake to do things I don't want to do because I have to do them. Every night I suffer from insomnia caused by a cocktail of depression, anxiety and adhd. Whenever I'm alot with my thoughts, my thoughts take over and there is no amount of \"mindfulness\" that can control it. I don't want to take drugs cause I don't want to be controlled by a substance but at the same time I need to function or society will cause my life to become even worse. The drug thing is me being borderline ableist, obstinate and indignant about \"needing\" something to function, part of me feels I don't want to be \"better\" all being better is being able to function as a cog in the machine I don't know what it happened but at a certain point I just stopped being able/ wanting to do things that didn't make me happy or made me miserable or forced me to work hard (which is crazy cause i used to work so hard and push myself more than anyone). Every night I sleep on average around 5 am. I used to be a decent student and have high ambitions but every year i see them drift away and the more they drift away the more I lose dedication, resolve, and will power to make my dreams/goals come true.\n\nI'm constantly forgoing general hygiene going days without brushing or showering. I rarely do my laundry and wear the same shit multiple days a week. I was once super frugal with my money and had tremendous delay gratification and that is all but gone. I constantly replay ever awkward moment or mistake I've ever made in life. I'm frequently reliving traumatic and depressing experiences I've had in my like. I'm constantly hung up on the past, stalled in the present, and terrified of the future especially a future in which i continue to behave in the manner I am behaving. I have constant fears that my once \"vast\" intellect has completely strayed from me. I'm extremely lazy, self loathing, self depreciating and the scariest part is I've come to love it. I am addicted to catharsis.\nThe worse part of it all is although I am currently agnostic, I grew up heavily Christian and because of this and coupled with my existential dread I will never be able to bring myself to end my life. I fear both an afterlife snd and the lack of one. Im terrified of both living eternally as well as the void which trust my I know is nonsensical cause according to Occam's Razer imo after death is like to be like prelife but the way the human brain works (or at least mine) it can't comprehend that, it only knows life aka the known and the u known that is death is too much of gamble to risk. Im stuck here. The closest I can get is neglecting myself which I dread because then my death will be slow and painful, or just simply hoping, begging, praying, manifesting that some day i get in a fatal crash, robbery, accident or something that allows me to leave her while both being surprised by it (i want to die but i cant stand anxiety of seeing it coming) and a way that won't shattered the hearts of my friends and family like suicide would.\n\nMy only solace in life is food, my friends, and distracting my self with binging copious amounts of media such as anime, manga, tv shows, books, memes and league of legends. Anything I can do that I enjoy to force my brain to be occupied otherwise the ruminations are unbearable. Masturbation and sex have just turned into tools to dispense dopamine or aid in my sleep. I don't want to get over it, i don't want to fight it, i don't want to take it a day at a time, i don't want to suck it up and deal with it, i don't want to go through the monotony of life, i don't want to live in fear of people's perspections or abiding by the status quo, i don't want to constantly let down my friends and family, i don't want to grow old, feeble and sickly, i don't want to take risks, i don't want to work towards something only to fail and start again, i don't want to trust ppl and be betrayed, I don't want to live altruistically at the expense of myself, i don't want to live selfishly at the expense of my guilt, i don't want to be alone. \nI don't want to be here anymore, I don't want to do this anymore, but I have to. I don't want to live but I'm too scared to die. I'm defeated.\n\nDon't feel need to comment or reply. Was having another insomniac night and I wanted to A. fucking scream but thought this would be more appropriate, B. Occupy my mind with something other than media and games as I truly do need to sleep asap and C. I just wanted to put this out there for idk validation of my existance, my feelings, idk something about knowing others will read this is cathartic. Don't bother consoling, that isn't what this is about and many have tried for years to no avail and every year it gets worse. I've reach despair and come to terms with the fact this is who i am now, and have no real intentions of truly working \"self betterment\".\n\nThank you for attending my Ted Talk.",

The drug thing is me being borderline ableist, obstinate and indignant about &amp;quot;needing&amp;quot; something to function, part of me feels I don&amp;#39;t want to be &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; all being better is being able to function as a cog in the machine I don&amp;#39;t know what it happened but at a certain point I just stopped being able/ wanting to do things that didn&amp;#39;t make me happy or made me miserable or forced me to work hard (which is crazy cause i used to work so hard and push myself more than anyone). Every night I sleep on average around 5 am. I used to be a decent student and have high ambitions but every year i see them drift away and the more they drift away the more I lose dedication, resolve, and will power to make my dreams/goals come true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m constantly forgoing general hygiene going days without brushing or showering. I rarely do my laundry and wear the same shit multiple days a week. I was once super frugal with my money and had tremendous delay gratification and that is all but gone. I constantly replay ever awkward moment or mistake I&amp;#39;ve ever made in life. I&amp;#39;m frequently reliving traumatic and depressing experiences I&amp;#39;ve had in my like. I&amp;#39;m constantly hung up on the past, stalled in the present, and terrified of the future especially a future in which i continue to behave in the manner I am behaving. I have constant fears that my once &amp;quot;vast&amp;quot; intellect has completely strayed from me. I&amp;#39;m extremely lazy, self loathing, self depreciating and the scariest part is I&amp;#39;ve come to love it. I am addicted to catharsis.\nThe worse part of it all is although I am currently agnostic, I grew up heavily Christian and because of this and coupled with my existential dread I will never be able to bring myself to end my life. I fear both an afterlife snd and the lack of one. Im terrified of both living eternally as well as the void which trust my I know is nonsensical cause according to Occam&amp;#39;s Razer imo after death is like to be like prelife but the way the human brain works (or at least mine) it can&amp;#39;t comprehend that, it only knows life aka the known and the u known that is death is too much of gamble to risk. Im stuck here. The closest I can get is neglecting myself which I dread because then my death will be slow and painful, or just simply hoping, begging, praying, manifesting that some day i get in a fatal crash, robbery, accident or something that allows me to leave her while both being surprised by it (i want to die but i cant stand anxiety of seeing it coming) and a way that won&amp;#39;t shattered the hearts of my friends and family like suicide would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only solace in life is food, my friends, and distracting my self with binging copious amounts of media such as anime, manga, tv shows, books, memes and league of legends. Anything I can do that I enjoy to force my brain to be occupied otherwise the ruminations are unbearable. Masturbation and sex have just turned into tools to dispense dopamine or aid in my sleep. I don&amp;#39;t want to get over it, i don&amp;#39;t want to fight it, i don&amp;#39;t want to take it a day at a time, i don&amp;#39;t want to suck it up and deal with it, i don&amp;#39;t want to go through the monotony of life, i don&amp;#39;t want to live in fear of people&amp;#39;s perspections or abiding by the status quo, i don&amp;#39;t want to constantly let down my friends and family, i don&amp;#39;t want to grow old, feeble and sickly, i don&amp;#39;t want to take risks, i don&amp;#39;t want to work towards something only to fail and start again, i don&amp;#39;t want to trust ppl and be betrayed, I don&amp;#39;t want to live altruistically at the expense of myself, i don&amp;#39;t want to live selfishly at the expense of my guilt, i don&amp;#39;t want to be alone. \nI don&amp;#39;t want to be here anymore, I don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore, but I have to. I don&amp;#39;t want to live but I&amp;#39;m too scared to die. I&amp;#39;m defeated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t feel need to comment or reply. Was having another insomniac night and I wanted to A. fucking scream but thought this would be more appropriate, B. Occupy my mind with something other than media and games as I truly do need to sleep asap and C. I just wanted to put this out there for idk validation of my existance, my feelings, idk something about knowing others will read this is cathartic. Don&amp;#39;t bother consoling, that isn&amp;#39;t what this is about and many have tried for years to no avail and every year it gets worse. I&amp;#39;ve reach despair and come to terms with the fact this is who i am now, and have no real intentions of truly working &amp;quot;self betterment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Either way I would have made this post even if my friend didn&amp;#39;t betray me but she was basically all I&amp;#39;ve had to look forward to for the past year, the only person who I thought genuinely cared for me and once again I&amp;#39;m replaced and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m rambling now. Thank you for reading this and if you read all of it that&amp;#39;s impressive, I guess, thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was bored so drawing alleviated some of the boredom. I eventually became quite good at making images. Mostly monsters and dinosaurs, heavy metal type stuff. But after school I become depressed. I was depressed during school but it just got worse after. \n\nI spent at lot of time on watching videos about spirituality and meaning. Trying to find answers to the fundamental questions. Why am I here? What's the meaning to life? That sort of thing. It led me down a crazy path. A path wrought with everything from the paranormal to ancient aliens. And everything in between. I like to listen to Alan Watts and Echart Tolle. Those two where the most satisfying. There's plenty of lies out there though. But this isn't what this post is about. I don't know what it's about.\n\nGenerally the anhedonia kind of strips away any passion or motivation you had for creating any artwork. What's the point? I try to see it as art therapy. Something cathartic. I don't know how to articulate this feeling of emptiness. How do you describe something that's not there? I tried drawing again last night. Why? Maybe for myself. Maybe to get attention. I see nothing wrong with desiring attention but I also don't want to cheapen what I do for that reason only. I wish I could just lie to myself and tell myself there's this cosmic or magical reason and motivation to making some art but I just don't believe in it. Like there's this artist that says she's channeling aliens or spirits through her art. No offense to those that believe in that sort of thing but I don't. I can't get anything like that to talk to me. So anything I create may not be as important since there's no spiritual connection. Whatever that means.\n\nSo here I am. Trying to find meaning where there is none. Some say that it's good that nothing has any inherent meaning because if there was a great cosmic meaning created by some alien somewhere then it would probably be something detrimental to our health and happiness. I remember my school days. I made art to keep boredom at bay. That's what it's meaning was. I was bored. I became quite good at it and kind of won some friendships due to my silly comics I used to draw. But I rarely ever had any friends and I have none now. Except for one I don't see anymore. Just online buddies. I guess I just have to force myself to be creative again. Maybe even pretend it serves some great purpose. Why not?",

At first me and the girl were super chill and i loved her so much but over time i have started to feel like she doesn\u2019t like me at all or maybe even hates me and my personality. We have a guy group in this dorm and she has slept with 3/8 of the guys which no hate you do you. The most recent guy i used to be really close with however he is not the most attractive and she told me sober that she would never get with him. So when she did this came as a shock and i was trying to be a caring friend on both sides. I told her don\u2019t lead him on because he\u2019s a really nice guy and don\u2019t actually hook up with him unless you really do like him. This is because i hooked up w a guy over summer that I remember not finding attractive at all but i liked how nice he was, i still regret it every second. I think she took offense to this though because ever since then she doesn\u2019t talk to me as much as my roommate, i feel disconnected with them. She did stuff with the guy one night and only told my roommate about it then i heard them talking about it and questioned it and they said they were talking about nothing. Then we went back to our home towns and the girl visits \u201cus\u201d pretty much every week. She lives at my roommates house because her home town is 2 hours away. The other day i was hanging out with my roommate, the girl and the guy at his house. We were all smoking and i was talking then randomly the girl whispered to the guy something while looking at me. I didn\u2019t mention it because i didnt want to start drama, im not a confrontational person at all. Its been 2 days since then and neither my roommate or the girl has texted me about anything, not even to hang, ive just gotten sent mass tik tok dms that my roommate sends everyone. Please let me know if im overthinking im starting to get really depressed about it i feel like my two closest friends hate me.",

         "selftext": "Major Depressive Disorder with PTSD is and has been a bitch most of my life. I'm 38 and just under a year officially disabled. \n\nBoth hips replaced because the joints collapsed thanks to Avascular Necrosis. \n\nThe first surgery was scary enough. I have my now 16 year old daughter full time. I'm her sole parent. A few years before we lost her pawpaw, my father in law (just because our divorce the wife doesn't mean you divorce the family) , died getting a hip replacement. It was a wildly random complication. In a way it was for the best. Alzheimer's is a fucking bitch and it took away my best friend. \n\nAnyway...when I told my daughter about the need for surgery...she had a meltdown. We worked through it together with talks to my doctors and with our therapists. \n\nThen my mother...her grandmother fucked it up by being a Xanax addicted Narc. \n\nWe worked though it and she was on no contact for the stunt. \n\nThen middle of October my other hip collapsed. November first, I got the other one removed and there have been complications. I can't walk without my walker or crutches. \n\nMy knee is constantly swollen and hurts. My leg hurts. I can't feel the inside of my entire leg. And there is consistent nerve pain. \n\nPain pills help with the pain but they also help me sleep a lot. \n\nThe weird manefestations that come with all of the issues have been on random full force. I need to add to my figures collection. I got a couple of switch games for my birthday but my daughter's switch is hers. My girlfriend's brother let me use his but I don't wanna lose my saves. So thankfully my girlfriend got me one for Christmas. \n\nIn my head it was such a big deal. I got a case and screen protector...like I do with all of my electronics. That got me by until I got my tempered glass protectors. \n\nI've updated all the software and set it all up....\n\n\nBut I've not played one game. Managed to remove all my figures and my studio stuff around and have yet to get them out, dust, clean and organize them. \n\n\nI'm doing better than I was....then I slink back. A little at a time. Progress. It just sucks and I hate it. \n\nThe thing that kicked me really hard was being dubbed medically frail by my insurance....then followed by a talk from my doctor's stating that I will never work again. I've got the disease in my knees and suspected in my ankle. But now...every random ache...causes worry. \n\n\nI just lay in bed...get up...piddle around with my walker or my crutches....barely doing much....and then laying back down. Videos on my phone. I feel like I wasted money on the videogames even though I really really want to play.....\n\nMy apologies. I don't mean to bitch. \n\nI hope you all have good mornings/days.",

And there is consistent nerve pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pain pills help with the pain but they also help me sleep a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weird manefestations that come with all of the issues have been on random full force. I need to add to my figures collection. I got a couple of switch games for my birthday but my daughter&amp;#39;s switch is hers. My girlfriend&amp;#39;s brother let me use his but I don&amp;#39;t wanna lose my saves. So thankfully my girlfriend got me one for Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my head it was such a big deal. I got a case and screen protector...like I do with all of my electronics. That got me by until I got my tempered glass protectors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve updated all the software and set it all up....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve not played one game. Managed to remove all my figures and my studio stuff around and have yet to get them out, dust, clean and organize them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing better than I was....then I slink back. A little at a time. Progress. It just sucks and I hate it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that kicked me really hard was being dubbed medically frail by my insurance....then followed by a talk from my doctor&amp;#39;s stating that I will never work again. I&amp;#39;ve got the disease in my knees and suspected in my ankle. But now...every random ache...causes worry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just lay in bed...get up...piddle around with my walker or my crutches....barely doing much....and then laying back down. Videos on my phone. I feel like I wasted money on the videogames even though I really really want to play.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My apologies. I don&amp;#39;t mean to bitch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you all have good mornings/days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am certain that I'm going to take my life some day, I just have to build up courage and stop being scared of what will come to happen after taking my life.\n\nmy story:\n\nI became a father 9 months ago and since my girlfriends pregnancy, both of our lives have been miserable. Before my child I was a national champion in boxing 2 years in a row, with plans and coaches around me waiting for me to turn professional and live from my hobby and i had my own little company.\n\nEver since this little man came to be, i might have gone to the gym 25-30 times in 9 months and there is no work left for me after my 3 months leave. We basically have no income and i started paying our rent from the money i was going to pay tax from - so I am greatly in depth too.\n\nI have always struggled with mental health issues, this is kind of why I'm good at boxing - I can endure long sessions because this is the only place i get to rest my head - now my mind is full of thoughts and I never seem to get any rest or peace from either my kid or my own brain.\n\nOur life at home has become one long discussion about who is the most tired, who hates life the most and who will leave this planet first - this is super unhealthy for the child to feel.\n\nMy family is in another country and i left all my friends there too - I have no contact with any of them - so I sit inside all day, waiting for the next time baby sleeps - so I can put my head on the pillow for just 1-2 hours.  \n\n\nShould I write a note for my baby before suiciding, for him to read when he grows up? or should i just let him forget me, because he won't remember me anyways?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nI lost everything in life because of having a baby - don't ever get a child - I will take my own life, decision is already made.",

She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.\n\nThings seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn\u2019t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she\u2019s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc. \n\nOne day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn\u2019t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.\n\nOn the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn\u2019t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).\n\nWhen she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she\u2019s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary. \n\nAfter her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn\u2019t at home.\n\nShe has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through. \n\nRight now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don\u2019t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it. \n\nWe came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:\n\n* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won\u2019t open up to her therapist. (and it\u2019s very unlikely that she would ever)\n* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?\n* Since we already know that she\u2019s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?\n\nSorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn\u2019t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.",

         "selftext": "This is just a rant because I just have to type this out of my system I think. \n\nI had my past with depression and anxiety/panic and ocd disorder since my late teens and at the age of 21 it got kind of better but mostly because I changed my lifestyle - quit day drinking, smoking, eating like there is no tomorrow and I felt great (ofc the beginning was hard af), went to therapy regularly and I also went to live in a another country nearby. But 2 years later I had to come home because my legs were f\\*d up and I didn't have enough money to cover the therapy for it (was working as a waitress and bartender) so my parents offered to help me. I came back, legs got a little better and then I had to find a job. Thankfully found one near to my parents house and its an okay job, I cant complain. Its not THE DREAM but it is a safe and ok payed job. Thru that job I met my now boyfriend and everything seemed fine. \n\nAt the begining of last year, I started to really hate my job because it was just too much for me. I have no college degree so I always feel like the stupid one from the whole team. But that's fine because I  don't even think of me anymore as a smart person. I feel like a complete failure.\n\nMy dad got really sick at the end of September 2019. We found out he has a brain tumor (malignant, stage 4) and that fucking ruined me. I never had a close relationship with him, but thats my dad. the way I think, which is like 100% negative, I was already preparing for his funeral and THAT thought made me almost puke. not the thought itself but my way of thinking. this is my dad for christ sake I thought and here I am...making plans for his funeral. My bf keeps telling me it's normal to have such neg thoughts, but I must not cling to them, aknowledge them and move past them...but I cant do that.\n\nMy dad had an operation, it went \"well\" for what the tumor is. They don't know how much time he has left but its usually 1 - 5 years life expectancy. He is going thru chemo now and so far so good BUT STILL...it's hard, so hard for me and my mum because we are the only close relatives (my parents are 66 and 63 yrs old). ofc some of our family helps with what they can but the psychical \"work\" and stress...I cant deal with it anymore. I am just filled up to the top. Ofc I don't show that to my parents, I keep smiling but I cry whenever I can because then I feel at ease somehow. My bf doesn't understand that but he supports me where he cans. and that's another thing. my relationship atm isn't the best. I don't wanna be touched, and sex...no thank you. I feel disgusting. I changed weight the last months from normal to \" YOU HAVE TO EAT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE\" and atm I gained weight again. I started smoking again and have a glass of wine once or twice a week just to calm my nerves. My mom is soooo stressed and exsausted and it hurts me so so much because she is my best friend and my dad, due to the operation and constant mood swings, he treats her like shit. it breaks my heart everytime. I try to talk to him because he actually likes to talk to me and I try to calmly explain to him that she is a little bit tired (don't wanna make it sound like he is the trouble child) but it's like talking to a wall. (in the country and city we live in, there is no psychical support or something like where the hospital can suggest you on of their therapists, because they only have one). I took two weeks off just so I can somehow help in the household. It's chaotic.\n\nMy bf's and mine flat (it's basically the first floor of my parents house) is in my eyes PURE CHAOS. I didn't pay much attention to that before due to all the recent crap that has happened but now,whenever I have time I clean. Like an insane person and I am furious during that. I know that a lot of people will say that depression makes you feel unmotivated to do anything, and I was like that  for the whole 3 months now, didn't wash myself even though I had to go to work somedays. I just felt disgusting and I wanted to stay that way. I wanted to just run away from all this. I just want to vanish. \n\nI used to go to therapy before my dad got diagnosed (because of my OCD) but now I really dont have time and when i do, i just wanna do nothing and sleep and cry and cry until it makes me sick. I wanna scream. Insurance doesn't cover therapy so I have to go to a private one and each seasion is around 50 bucks which is for me atm, a lot. \n\nAll I see is chaos, and I just want it all to be gone. The chaos in the the house I can handle, even though my scoliosis isn't much happy about it, but the chaos in our lifes ....I'm scared..and I feel like a crybaby because of it. I don't talk to people about it anymore (my dad), I only say \"he's fine\" just so that i don't think about how nothing is fine. I fucking hate myself so much. I havent felt this hate in sooo long and its just pure shit. Im sorry if im talking nonsense, and nothing is really well written. I just wanna type because I cant scream. \n\nthen, a month ago, my dad had a heart attack in the middle of the night. That took the air out of lungs again. he got a stent placed and at the visiting hours I would just faint. Couldn't sleep or eat, I was just driving from home to the hospital and on and on. Two days later my dad got to go home and the stress in the house continued.\n\nI wanna be there for my family, but its hard once you realise in aaaall this shit that you dont even know your family. My dad is a workaholic and was never really home and my mom, she is the best mom. Even though my dad and I had our differences, I wanna be there for him but also I want to be gone. Gone from this earth. Like I never existed.\n\nmy bfs sometimes jokingly says something about when will we have kids (he is 32 and I just turned 26, 2 yrs together) and I tell him everytime - please dont mention this. I cant have a child in the middle of this. he is not stupid, he knows that but he tries to lift me up which he barely ever can and that breaks my heart. I've been more shitty to him recently, he is a chill guy and I was never chill and I dunno if I'll ever be. I feel like he doesnt do anything in the house (he does some of it) so I always have to tell him, like I'm his mom. I try to explain to him that I'd like that he cleans sometimes the toilet or makes lunch/dinner when I come home from work or the hospital. Sometimes he does, but not really and that makes me even more mad and upset. But at the end of the day he is a great guy, he would do ANYTHING for me, I know that this is also hard for him because he almost lost his dad due to cancer so I dont even know whom to speek to. I don't wanna remind him of his pain that he went thru so I just cry. I feel like Im a shitty gf and daughter but I try, i really do TRY to convince myself that all this will calm one day and I will be better but it feels like a massive lie. \n\nI apologize for the long post and my english and thank you for reading thi and I'm sorry if this isnt the place for it but I just wanted it out of me.\n\nI will try to be better. I will try to fight, don't know how but I will. \n\nGuys, stay safe !",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just a rant because I just have to type this out of my system I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my past with depression and anxiety/panic and ocd disorder since my late teens and at the age of 21 it got kind of better but mostly because I changed my lifestyle - quit day drinking, smoking, eating like there is no tomorrow and I felt great (ofc the beginning was hard af), went to therapy regularly and I also went to live in a another country nearby. But 2 years later I had to come home because my legs were f*d up and I didn&amp;#39;t have enough money to cover the therapy for it (was working as a waitress and bartender) so my parents offered to help me. I came back, legs got a little better and then I had to find a job. Thankfully found one near to my parents house and its an okay job, I cant complain. Its not THE DREAM but it is a safe and ok payed job. Thru that job I met my now boyfriend and everything seemed fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the begining of last year, I started to really hate my job because it was just too much for me. I have no college degree so I always feel like the stupid one from the whole team. But that&amp;#39;s fine because I  don&amp;#39;t even think of me anymore as a smart person. I feel like a complete failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad got really sick at the end of September 2019. We found out he has a brain tumor (malignant, stage 4) and that fucking ruined me. I never had a close relationship with him, but thats my dad. the way I think, which is like 100% negative, I was already preparing for his funeral and THAT thought made me almost puke. not the thought itself but my way of thinking. this is my dad for christ sake I thought and here I am...making plans for his funeral. My bf keeps telling me it&amp;#39;s normal to have such neg thoughts, but I must not cling to them, aknowledge them and move past them...but I cant do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad had an operation, it went &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; for what the tumor is. They don&amp;#39;t know how much time he has left but its usually 1 - 5 years life expectancy. He is going thru chemo now and so far so good BUT STILL...it&amp;#39;s hard, so hard for me and my mum because we are the only close relatives (my parents are 66 and 63 yrs old). ofc some of our family helps with what they can but the psychical &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; and stress...I cant deal with it anymore.

It used to not be so bad, it still effected me but nowadays I\u2019m a total wreck\n\nI don\u2019t really feel comfortable around my friends anymore because of some embarrassing shit I\u2019ve done recently, we\u2019ve had good times in the past but now I tend to be more quiet around them, I\u2019ve started to realize I don\u2019t share many interests with them.\n\nI\u2019ve just turned 18 and I\u2019m graduating soon I feel like wasted my entire school life and there is no going back. Whenever I\u2019m in class I\u2019m scared I might break the chair I\u2019m sitting on because it\u2019s happened in the past. I wear shitty clothes because of my weight and anxiety.\n\nI\u2019ve tried many times to lose my weight but I always give up. I\u2019ve played football for two years but I did not improve at all, was the fattest one on my football team and didn\u2019t see much play. I\u2019ve tried working out regularly multiple times but never stuck to it\n\nI\u2019m Native American and grew up on an extremely poor reservation, I lived with my mom and two brother and it was nice for the most part when everyone was sober.\nLooking back I miss being my self without any shame. \n\nI moved away from the rez to my sisters at the age 9-10 (grade 5). From their it started, I felt like and outsider with my sister and brother (dads side) the way they talked, and what talked about was different, same story at school. I think because of this I closed myself off in fear of embarrassment or being seen as weird, instead I tried to act differently. Great idea right?\n\nI hated school. In grade 7 (which is the first year of middle school) I used to stay up all night playing games and sleep during school, of course I had no friends. This stopped after grade 7 though and the rest of middle school actually wasn\u2019t that bad. I got put into a class with a bunch of other natives, they were from a different tribe though, which meant I couldn\u2019t really relate to them in that department. But it was still fun.\n\nGrade 10 (High school) is when it my anxiety started was getting worse. The older natives in grade 11 at the time were very judgmental, you had to act a certain way to not teased, I followed their behaviour and so did my friends. I always felt like I wasn\u2019t myself when I was with my friends but I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nDuring my time living with my sister and attending white schools I developed severe anxiety. Now I don\u2019t say things very often. Any time I\u2019m in class the anxiety hits even harder. At home is when the depression kicks in, I use Reddit, YouTube, Porn and Games to distract my self.\n\nAnytime I get a break from school I stay home all day. I\u2019m sick of it. During especially long breaks I start going down a deep path, just recently during a 3 week break is when I felt the worst. By the end of it I had a semi break down. And texted my mom for help. As a result my sister and dad tried to set up a therapist appointment but I wasn\u2019t 18 at the time and no therapist in my town would have me. Since then I\u2019m now 18 but now my confidence is gone so I haven\u2019t really brought it up yet\n\nMy mom loves me with all her heart, and I do to. She used to drink sometimes but mostly she just takes pills now. She had me at a later age so she getting old now, she has been though a lot in her life. She lost her only daughter before I was born, and nearly killed her self. When I left her she went into a deep depression, she still struggles with loneliness. \nI love both of my brothers (mom\u2019s side) but one is an alcoholic and the other used to do hard drugs, both high school drop outs\n\nLiving on the reservation is not easy. Drug use is a huge issue, I\u2019m almost certain that if I had lived my teenage years on the Rez I would\u2019ve fallen to the dark side. Probably would\u2019ve dropped out by now as my brothers did before me. But now that 18 and almost done school I\u2019m going to move back closer to the Rez just so I can visit the family\n\nAfter writing all this down I feel much better. I just want go over my past a little bit. There is a lot of details missing but I\u2019m tired of writing now",

From their it started, I felt like and outsider with my sister and brother (dads side) the way they talked, and what talked about was different, same story at school. I think because of this I closed myself off in fear of embarrassment or being seen as weird, instead I tried to act differently. Great idea right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated school. In grade 7 (which is the first year of middle school) I used to stay up all night playing games and sleep during school, of course I had no friends. This stopped after grade 7 though and the rest of middle school actually wasn\u2019t that bad. I got put into a class with a bunch of other natives, they were from a different tribe though, which meant I couldn\u2019t really relate to them in that department. But it was still fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grade 10 (High school) is when it my anxiety started was getting worse. The older natives in grade 11 at the time were very judgmental, you had to act a certain way to not teased, I followed their behaviour and so did my friends. I always felt like I wasn\u2019t myself when I was with my friends but I didn\u2019t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my time living with my sister and attending white schools I developed severe anxiety. Now I don\u2019t say things very often. Any time I\u2019m in class the anxiety hits even harder. At home is when the depression kicks in, I use Reddit, YouTube, Porn and Games to distract my self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime I get a break from school I stay home all day. I\u2019m sick of it. During especially long breaks I start going down a deep path, just recently during a 3 week break is when I felt the worst. By the end of it I had a semi break down. And texted my mom for help. As a result my sister and dad tried to set up a therapist appointment but I wasn\u2019t 18 at the time and no therapist in my town would have me. Since then I\u2019m now 18 but now my confidence is gone so I haven\u2019t really brought it up yet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom loves me with all her heart, and I do to. She used to drink sometimes but mostly she just takes pills now. She had me at a later age so she getting old now, she has been though a lot in her life. She lost her only daughter before I was born, and nearly killed her self. When I left her she went into a deep depression, she still struggles with loneliness. \nI love both of my brothers (mom\u2019s side) but one is an alcoholic and the other used to do hard drugs, both high school drop outs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living on the reservation is not easy. Drug use is a huge issue, I\u2019m almost certain that if I had lived my teenage years on the Rez I would\u2019ve fallen to the dark side. Probably would\u2019ve dropped out by now as my brothers did before me. But now that 18 and almost done school I\u2019m going to move back closer to the Rez just so I can visit the family&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After writing all this down I feel much better. I just want go over my past a little bit. There is a lot of details missing but I\u2019m tired of writing now&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "Hello reddit. It\u2019s hard for me to put it into words but I have recently felt like I have just been psychotic or even a dick. I can\u2019t stop. Let me explain. Just a couple of examples: \n\nWhen I am with my dog I can\u2019t help but feel he doesn\u2019t love me back. It\u2019s weird, Even though I am laying with him right now and I didn\u2019t even invite him to my room he came with his own will. But I feel nothing. \n\nThis one really makes me want to cry.. my mom got me a desk pretty expensive too, but for some reason even while she is sitting there watching me set this thing up I can\u2019t stand her presence same goes for my dad. I just say something like \u201cyou don\u2019t have to watch me the whole time\u201d even if she there for like 3 minutes.  It makes me want to cry because my mom is so sweet and just a hard working soul to keep my family from falling apart...she works so hard. But I never do anything to help like the dishes or other chores. Because I guess I\u2019m self centered. \n\nMy family...well my father cheated on my mother but they are still together so you can only imagine what type of family we are. There is no abuse just a lot of fake ness. (btw I\u2019m the only one in my family that knows besides my mom) My dad claims to be more holy now he even sends me bible quotes and other stuff. \n\nMy love life? Non existent... I would say it\u2019s not about my looks. I have been told my whole life that I am attractive. It\u2019s just I am very picky. No girl meets my standard, and if they do I can barley approach them. Because I\u2019m not only afraid of rejection but also I\u2019m afraid of not receiving the same love back. (Probably because of a past situation with this girl I knew) \n\nSometimes when I\u2019m in a social situation I always seem to somehow fuck up a mood. I end up saying some stupid shit. I\u2019m not annoying and I\u2019m not needy. Either. \n\nI have always been fit but recently I started working out more and joining back onto my football team but I still feel empty.  (I didn\u2019t workout and and stuff because of how I feel btw) \n\nI constantly only look at negatives in every positive situation. Ha ha ha that\u2019s depression right there isn\u2019t it? I have always said to myself that I have and will never be depressed. But here I am...I don\u2019t even see through my own eyes anymore it\u2019s like I\u2019m in a 3rd person view but also in 1st person (imagine that for a second).  Life is moving so slow and so fast at the same time for me. \n\nI have a pretty good idea on what the problem is I think it\u2019s just lack of love and loneliness, but I don\u2019t know what to do to fix it. \n\nI am a fallen angel\ud83e\udd21...meaning I was catholic but then realized that \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of believing\u201d...because really no one knows..but that\u2019s a different conversation. \n\nMaybe I needed to write this to get it all out or maybe it\u2019s just I\u2019m going through \u201crebellion/depression\u201d though regardless I appreciate you reading this whole thing. It would take a genius to give me some advice but maybe you can.  \n\nIt\u2019s very sad for me because I am becoming more and more anti social even though everyone who knows me knows I\u2019m very enthusiastic and extroverted or that\u2019s what I used to think. Now I don\u2019t know what I am anymore and it frightens me. \n\nWe don\u2019t know why we are here on Earth and the point to all this, so isn\u2019t it childish to even bring myself down when it doesn\u2019t matter? Idk? I was a very happy kid and I don\u2019t know what happened.",

I remember consciously, seriously considering suicide since I was as ripe twelve years old, which boggles my fucking mind because I had no godforsaken idea how much worse things could possibly get. I'm an adult now, and every damn time I think I've hit rock bottom, I'm only proven wrong.\n\nI can't even remember the last time I felt truly alive, that I felt happy. This isn't living. There are reasons I guess, I was cheated out of a childhood, my family life was and is all sorts of layered fucked up, and I am so mentally damaged I realize that it is impossible for me to ever have a happy or fulfilling relationship, and I can only ever be damaged by those who claim to love me and damage those who I truly love. But in the end, it doesn't really matter why I want to die, just that I do, and I can't. And I know-- you're supposed to encourage me to live. But don't I have a right to die?? Don't I get to make that decision?? Why are we as a society so keen on forcing people to live who don't want to fucking be here?\n\nBut I can't die. Whoever said suicide is the easy way out didn't know what they were talking about. I've been planning for two days straight now, trying to come up with some godforsaken fullproof plan to disguise my suicide as an accident or a murder. If my family knew, they'd never forgive themselves and feel abandoned, if my boyfriend knew, he would be fucking destroyed, maybe for life. And worst of all, I have a very complicated and toxic relationship with an ex who I honestly still very deeply care about despite everything, and he knows I've been suicidal. He told me I wasn't allowed to do something as shitty as that, and if I killed myself, he promised that he would too. I know as sure as the sun rises that he would. I can't be responsible for his death too.\n\nI figured my only way out, and the best way, is if everyone thinks I died some other way, it will be hard, but they won't feel that I wanted to leave them. But god, there's no fucking foolproof way to pull this off, I've scrapped plan after plan after plan and I've just about given up and I feel so hopeless. I can't even kill myself. God, I can't even die, I can't even get any peace. I can't do this anymore, I've wanted to leave for so long. But I'm trapped. Trapped in some sort of hellish limbo, a nightmare in between life and death. I can never really live, but I can never really die. What am I supposed to do? What in sweet hell is someone like me supposed to do??\n\nI feel so stupid, I probably sound like an angry, mentally-ill drunk retard. And maybe I am. But I hurt so much. I'm crying so hard my chest hurts and my throat is all closed up, I can barely breathe. I've just gone through my belongings and thrown away everything I don't want to be remembered by, or want to be found after my death, if I can even get to that point. It's just wishful thinking in a sick and twisted way. I never thought I'd come to see death as such a blissful privilege. But here I am. I understand if you don't really have an answer for me. I don't think there is one. I don't even really know why I'm writing this.",

I feel like no one wants to be around me and I'm just a downer. \n\nI'm home for winter break, and I've been at home for over 2 weeks and have only seen high school friends once - the rest of the time, they've had holiday plans and some of them have hung out separately, but no one's tried to make plans with me. I've tried to make plans with people or asked to hang out but no one seems to actually want to see me. I've barely talked to anyone since break started and it just hurts because I was so lonely this past semester and I was looking forward to coming here and seeing friends from home, but instead, I've become even more depressed over break. I can't even look forward to going back to school because there's nothing to look forward to. Other people in college have their friend groups already and seem to be having fun and making memories, and I'm not doing anything. Half of college is almost over, and it's just passed me by. This whole semester was a blur, I barely even remember anything that happened. \n\nI'm almost 20, and I've never been on a date or even kissed anyone. I'm a bisexual girl, the dating pool should be twice as big for me but 2 times 0 is still 0 I guess. I'm not attractive so I shouldn't expect anyone to be interested, but I'm scared I'll never be able to date anyone.\n\nI think about the future and my goals and I don't see anything. I can't even imagine existing 5 years from now. I wouldn't hurt myself but I don't think anyone would care if I disappeared, so sometimes I feel like it would be nice to take a vacation from my life for a while, just blink out of existence and come back mentally healthy. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you. I don't know if there's a point in me posting this, but it helped to write it out. I guess I wanted to see if anyone related to anything I wrote, to see if I'm not alone in feeling alone.",

My last post talked about my bleak, do-nothing lifestyle. Fitting to my shitty personality, it is in fact true that nothing has changed since then. I still spend my days with no passion for life and a hole in my heart desperately needing to be plugged with... anything, really.\n\nCollege is starting up again, and all the same realizations are flooding back. I want nothing in my life; I don't feel excited for where life will take me. Not even college has changed that. Feeling much of anything is met with the realization that it's only temporary, and there's surely something to ruin it that I haven't thought of yet. It's a cycle of shit that I spin around in on a daily basis and I'm getting dizzy.\n\nI repress love, I disappoint the people around me, I don't take care of myself or my family, I don't have hobbies anymore, and at this point I don't feel like much is going to change, let alone for the better. When things do change, it's because people take the initiative to change it. I've never had an ounce of initiative in my fucking life and all I've ever accomplished was off the merits of others. All my friends, all my accolades, anything that I'm worth to anybody, I worked to gain none of it. I constantly remind myself of how hollow of a person I am, how empty everything feels.\n\nOh actually, one thing has changed in 3 years: I've stopped crying. I've stopped asking for help. My current psychological goal is to just accept that I'm doomed to live the way that I live. If nothing's changed before, I don't expect it to now. \n\nI hate my past self for being too timid, reserved, and bottled, I hate my future self for settling for life instead of enjoying it, and I hate my present self for being exactly who I thought I'd be 3 years ago.",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 years dormant account, just checking in with myself again. You don&amp;#39;t have to read all this, it just helps to jot it down. My last post talked about my bleak, do-nothing lifestyle. Fitting to my shitty personality, it is in fact true that nothing has changed since then. I still spend my days with no passion for life and a hole in my heart desperately needing to be plugged with... anything, really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;College is starting up again, and all the same realizations are flooding back. I want nothing in my life; I don&amp;#39;t feel excited for where life will take me. Not even college has changed that. Feeling much of anything is met with the realization that it&amp;#39;s only temporary, and there&amp;#39;s surely something to ruin it that I haven&amp;#39;t thought of yet. It&amp;#39;s a cycle of shit that I spin around in on a daily basis and I&amp;#39;m getting dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I repress love, I disappoint the people around me, I don&amp;#39;t take care of myself or my family, I don&amp;#39;t have hobbies anymore, and at this point I don&amp;#39;t feel like much is going to change, let alone for the better. When things do change, it&amp;#39;s because people take the initiative to change it. I&amp;#39;ve never had an ounce of initiative in my fucking life and all I&amp;#39;ve ever accomplished was off the merits of others. All my friends, all my accolades, anything that I&amp;#39;m worth to anybody, I worked to gain none of it. I constantly remind myself of how hollow of a person I am, how empty everything feels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh actually, one thing has changed in 3 years: I&amp;#39;ve stopped crying. I&amp;#39;ve stopped asking for help. My current psychological goal is to just accept that I&amp;#39;m doomed to live the way that I live. If nothing&amp;#39;s changed before, I don&amp;#39;t expect it to now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate my past self for being too timid, reserved, and bottled, I hate my future self for settling for life instead of enjoying it, and I hate my present self for being exactly who I thought I&amp;#39;d be 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

And to be more open about my sexuality.\n\nI became dedicated to my fitness life ~2 years ago and lost alot of weight and never in my life have I ever thought that I was able to run a mile until now. I made fitness goals for myself and stuck with them. \n\nI work 3rd shift as registered nurse at my local hospital, I sleep most of the day and stay up at night....\n\nI became more social and went on a few dates. Who knew my ugly self can land dates with women I found out of my league. Ditto for that. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying so hard these past few years to better myself. I didn\u2019t want to go down the dark path again that lead me to contemplate suicide.

However, I feel utterly hopeless and am constantly tired. I feel little to no motivation to do things and I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve started to lose interest and not have as much fun doing things that I used to really enjoy. I try to help someone that I know who has been diagnosed with depression, but a lot of the time, I feel like I either don\u2019t help at all or end up making things worse. I hate myself and don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m worth anyone\u2019s time.

I'm still having turmoils and clinging on to the regrets that I have deep down inside me.\n\nI was never anyone's best friend. I never truly opened myself to anyone, even my family. Heck, I don't even know who myself truly is, because I never had a personality or \"self\" to begin with. I only wore \"masks\" and put up a facade and acted out \"personas\" that conformed to the expectations of those around me. \n\nAt home, I acted out the persona of an obedient son, one who constantly helped out with housework and behaved well especially during family outings. When I was with the troublesome kids in high school, I wore the mask of an \"asshole student\", I broke school regulations, vandalised, ditched class, constantly sweared and talked trash, spread rumors and made fun of others. College came and I shifted my mask into \"diligent student\", and I consistently aced tests, and performed spectacularly academically. \n\nI polished this \"diligent college student\" mask so much, I did end up having remarkable grades and graduated with honor and awards.

College ended and I had to drop this mask, and I'm left with my blank self again.\n\nI worn so many masks throughout my life, that I don't know my true self and personality anymore. Our family and relatives know me as the sweet obedient son who is very helpful and follows parents orders without fail. While people in high school know me as an asshole, and people in college knows me as the genius anti-social kid. There are times when people actually called me out for acting like a completely different person and \"out of character\", since I've only been showing them a mask of myself. \n\nNeedless to say, this identity crisis maybe crippled my social life as nobody treated me as their \"friend\". Sure there were some acquaintances, but they all since drifted away and doesn't keep in touch anymore. I feel like I wasted away my youth, and I am never gonna experience it anymore. I'm longing for a best friend that I can visit unannounced. I missed out on having a tight knit circle, singing all throughout the night in a karaoke bar.

         "selftext": "Long time lurker first time posting on reddit. \n\nThis is a bit long so bare with me please.\n\nBack story/basics:\n\n I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and insomnia when I was 16, was on medications for a bit and then stopped because, in my mothers words: \"It was all costing too much.\" ( She lost our insurance when she lost her job a couple years before that so it all was out of pocket.) \n\nLet's just say being diagnosed wasn't the best thing for my mom to come to terms with... She, nor NY grandmother were happy that I was diagnosed. \"You'll get over it... It is just a phase...\" Everyone knows the bs that others spew when they're not forced to confront their own inner demons. \n\nNeedless to say, for years I dealt with my depression and insomnia by simply being tired and pretending to be happy... And for a short while it did work. \n\nEarly 2014 I was a non-traditional college student (was over 18), and working about 50 hours a week and had broken up with my bf the christmas of 13.... It was not a good time for me personally... I was flunking out of school simply because I did not wish to go to school anymore... I was tired all of the time. I was told to talk to the school therapist and told him that at the rate I was going, within the year I would probably end it all. \n\nNeedless to say, he had me self admit to a psych hospital, only stayed 3 days because of lack of insurance. Was given even more diagnosis' to add to my list: generalized anxiety, something bad happened to me when I was 19. Insomnia turned into severe insomnia, and suicidal thoughts and ideations (basically thinking about all the ways to kill myself and how I would do it.) My mom and gma visited a couple of times and basically they were disappointed that i was admitted for contemplating suicide... That I \"shouldn't be there\"... \n\nTwo years ago borderline personality disorder was added to my roster... Mainly, in my opinion, because the Dr was an older gentleman and I told him in my past I was very promiscuous hadn't been at the time, but it is what it is. \n\nCurrently:\n\nI'm 32 years old now and have been battling this depression for half of my life. I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 months (promise this isn't a JNSO but this info is important... I think). He basically started off as a f**k buddies which turned into him living with me and us being together... He keeps flipping back and forth between telling people I'm hie girlfriend to just the chick he lives with, his words not mine. He gets onto me for reading, working on my cross stitch, or playing The Sims. He likes touching me, places i don't want him to touch when we are not in bed, but doesn't want me touching him, doesn't want to try new positions in the bedroom, doesn't really look at me period when we are being intimate... Yes I've tried talking to him about not touching me like that, he still does it, he wont even try foreplay ( says he doesn't believe in it), and wont even attempt new positions, the one time we tried missionary only lasted a few seconds and he couldnt do it because I was \"smiling too much\", whatever that means. \n\nMy issue is that my depression has been running rampant lately, I'm sad, dont want to get out of bed, dont want to go to work (im the one paying all the bills in the house) and when I have tried to talk to him about it all he tells me to \"get out of my head\". i keep trying to tell him its not as easy as it sounds but he just doesn't listen. \n\nLately i haven't been motivated to keep this relationship going... I want to push him away, make him leave me basically, because in my head, he doesnt care about me or my feelings, he doesn't want to be with me but he has no other option so he is staying with me until he can get back on his feet and then he will leave and I'll once more be alone.\n\nI'll be alone and I'll be able to end it all... I'll be able to just walk away from this bs I call a life, I gave y'all the basics of my diagnosis' there's a lot more to my life, not the worst but definitely not the best either. \n\nI find that I'm just tired of fighting, of pretending I'm happy just to make everyone else around me happy. I dont know what to do anymore... I'm simply exhausted... I don't want to fight this anymore... I simply want to give up because I dont feel as if I have anything left to live for anymore because I don't think this relationship, or whatever he wants to call it, is going to work out in the end. No I dont want to end my life because of that... \n\nI want to end it all simply because I am tired...",

That I &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t be there&amp;quot;... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago borderline personality disorder was added to my roster... Mainly, in my opinion, because the Dr was an older gentleman and I told him in my past I was very promiscuous hadn&amp;#39;t been at the time, but it is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 32 years old now and have been battling this depression for half of my life. I&amp;#39;ve been with my boyfriend for about 6 months (promise this isn&amp;#39;t a JNSO but this info is important... I think). He basically started off as a f**k buddies which turned into him living with me and us being together... He keeps flipping back and forth between telling people I&amp;#39;m hie girlfriend to just the chick he lives with, his words not mine. He gets onto me for reading, working on my cross stitch, or playing The Sims. He likes touching me, places i don&amp;#39;t want him to touch when we are not in bed, but doesn&amp;#39;t want me touching him, doesn&amp;#39;t want to try new positions in the bedroom, doesn&amp;#39;t really look at me period when we are being intimate... Yes I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to him about not touching me like that, he still does it, he wont even try foreplay ( says he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in it), and wont even attempt new positions, the one time we tried missionary only lasted a few seconds and he couldnt do it because I was &amp;quot;smiling too much&amp;quot;, whatever that means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue is that my depression has been running rampant lately, I&amp;#39;m sad, dont want to get out of bed, dont want to go to work (im the one paying all the bills in the house) and when I have tried to talk to him about it all he tells me to &amp;quot;get out of my head&amp;quot;. i keep trying to tell him its not as easy as it sounds but he just doesn&amp;#39;t listen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately i haven&amp;#39;t been motivated to keep this relationship going... I want to push him away, make him leave me basically, because in my head, he doesnt care about me or my feelings, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be with me but he has no other option so he is staying with me until he can get back on his feet and then he will leave and I&amp;#39;ll once more be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be alone and I&amp;#39;ll be able to end it all... I&amp;#39;ll be able to just walk away from this bs I call a life, I gave y&amp;#39;all the basics of my diagnosis&amp;#39; there&amp;#39;s a lot more to my life, not the worst but definitely not the best either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that I&amp;#39;m just tired of fighting, of pretending I&amp;#39;m happy just to make everyone else around me happy. I dont know what to do anymore... I&amp;#39;m simply exhausted... I don&amp;#39;t want to fight this anymore... I simply want to give up because I dont feel as if I have anything left to live for anymore because I don&amp;#39;t think this relationship, or whatever he wants to call it, is going to work out in the end. No I dont want to end my life because of that... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to end it all simply because I am tired...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

For a while i tricked myself into thinking I could just wait till i die by some accident or until all my loved ones died so i can then kill myself, and that thought was comforting for while, but now it&amp;#39;s losing its appeal. I still can&amp;#39;t see myself committing suicide while i still have someone who cares for me, yet i also can&amp;#39;t imagine living like this for the next however many years it takes for either of the aforementioned options to happen&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I had a pretty positive outlook on January 1st.\n\nDay 2: Found out my aunt and uncle's dog died, lost my job after getting in a nasty argument with the head chef/owner. (Well, it wasn't really an argument. It's his restaurant after all, but I have aspergers so of course I'm trash at my job, as always, so he called me out on my garbage work skills and fired me after I finished my shift.)\n\nDay 3: Went to a guitar center to apply so I could at least try and work in a field that aligns with my passion. Realized brakes on my car were on their last legs, prayed they wouldn't fail on my 25 minute drive home that involved freeways. Then I Ubered over to a friends place to get out of the house and we did dabs. It was nice and I actually woke up early feeling very refreshed.\n\nDay 4: Looked on indeed and ziprecruiter all day and found nothing but skilled jobs (college or certificate required) and ones that drug test. I need a job now dammit.\n\nDay 5: More job search depression. Same results as yesterday. Only went out to get more juul pods and food because those things are the only source of dopamine I have right now. Then went to a friends amazing arcade game party. (He has arcade machines set up in his basement and invited a bunch of people over to play those and some video games and hang out) I kinda just sat around. I apologized to him for being sorta quiet and he understood. It overall was pretty fun though.\n\nDay 6: Just started an hour and 13 minutes ago. I'm scared to go to sleep. I've been having weird and vivid dreams every night. I don't like them. I'll probably wake up somewhere between 11 and 12 and go back on indeed only to get the same results I got the last 10 times I searched.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with my life. I'm 23 and still with my parents. I was stressed at my new job but I was hoping it would be a learning experience and it paid pretty well. I was excited to finally be getting checks that would afford me my own car and maybe my own apartment sometime in the next year. My online searches weren't on indeed, but rather excitedly looking at house rentals/apartments in the city. I was genuinely happy.  I had a 4 day work week (10-12 hours per day, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm not doing anything else on work days anyway so I might as well make good use of that time)\n\nI don't even want to die. I just want to live a fulfilling life and be a generally useful person that contributes to society like everyone else. I want to be happy. I know I *can* get there but I don't know how and I'm scared.",

I was excited to finally be getting checks that would afford me my own car and maybe my own apartment sometime in the next year. My online searches weren&amp;#39;t on indeed, but rather excitedly looking at house rentals/apartments in the city. I was genuinely happy.  I had a 4 day work week (10-12 hours per day, but as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, I&amp;#39;m not doing anything else on work days anyway so I might as well make good use of that time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even want to die. I just want to live a fulfilling life and be a generally useful person that contributes to society like everyone else. I want to be happy. I know I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get there but I don&amp;#39;t know how and I&amp;#39;m scared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

No clubs really interested me (and if they did, they weren't on my specific campus). I did join a music-orientated club, but I didn't really have a positive experience in it honestly.\n\nI wasn't able to make friends through Uni classes either. For my compulsory classes, though there is some class discussion made here and there, it is otherwise 'sit down, shut up, do your work'.\n\nI don't go to lectures either. In my defense, it isn't exactly convenient to do so; 2 hour breaks between each lecture (with there being three), 2 hour commute home. There are lecture recordings available, so it really isn't worth the inconvenience.\n\nI guess making friends isn't exactly an easy experience and I should suffer the inconvenience to make my life more interesting or whatever, but I don't really have a common interest in my peers. I'm studying Media Arts (film, I guess), and my heart really isn't in it.\n\nI did have some positive experience in a group activity but no lasting relationships were made.\n\nLast year, during my break after exiting high school and waiting for March when Uni started, I did nothing. I had no friends and was pretty depressed. I'm still in that same spot, but I've started exercising frequently and filling my day with small but important routines just so I don't keep perpetuating the cycle of a life where I just feel bad about myself. And one of the key issues I have is my inability to make friends.\n\nShould I just keep putting myself out there? I'm interested in music but not good enough at my instrument to join a band, and nor do I really want to. Otherwise, I don't really have any other interests and I struggle to find a job (a job and a place of education seem to be the only places where one can easily make friends).

I&amp;#39;ve never been afraid of death because of depression but I&amp;#39;m starting to feel myself attracted to it again, and it&amp;#39;s really hard for me to stop thinking that way. I had suicidal thoughts for so long in the past it&amp;#39;s like a comfort zone now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, wish me luck, guys...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Unfortunately it seems like my body has adapted to it. My Psych upped the dosage several times until I was up to 200-250mg per day. Subsequently I tried a variety of different medications. I think Cymbalta, Lamictal, something that started with an M, and others. None seemed to help as well as Zoloft originally did. I even tried going off of meds entirely for a couple of months then going back onto Zoloft. I was trying for a tolerance break/reset. Which barely worked and totally wasn't worth it btw.\n\nAnyway, we've relocated recently and I went to see a new Psych. They've suggested coming off of the Zoloft and Wellbutrin that I'm currently on and trying Viibryd and/or Trintellix. Has anyone else used one or more of these meds? How have they worked for you? I know they can work differently for different people; I'm just curious about personal (or 2nd-hand) experiences with the meds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Have you (or someone you know) taken Zoloft, Viibryd and/or Trintellix?

Considering that I believe this relationship might actually be the source of all my stress and depression, I should see it as a step in the right direction even if a somewhat sad one. \n\nThe problem is that for the past few years, I've been on a hell of a downward spiral. A nosedive, really. It's been more and more difficult to keep a job. Luckily I find ways to come up with just enough to cover my bills but it's tough.\n\nI'm at the point where I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to leave the bedroom for food because I don't have the energy to speak to her kids. They don't deserve my seemingly uninterested short answers as I make my food and scurry back to the bedroom. \n\nMy issue is how the hell am I supposed to move out of here and go back to living a normal life when I can barely work up the energy to spend time in my own kitchen? I mean, I \"want\" to. I remember my life before and I feel like going back to that with all the things I've learned in the past 6 years could be awesome. But I also haven't worked a single job for more than a week at a time in over a year. \n\nI'm working on just finding a part time job for the moment. Any consistent income would be huge. I figure the routine of it might help get me back to normal with working a full time job.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this really. I just feel isolated I guess and writing it out seems to kind of help organize my thoughts.",

After slipping into the worst depression of my life, I decided enough was enough and got my Wellbutrin refilled. My current medications are remeron 15 mg, Wellbutrin 150mg , and Depakote 1500mg. \n\nDepression is something I am well accustomed to.

         "selftext": "Hey everyone. \n\nA little bit about myself I\u2019m a 21 year old male. Born in the US. Los Angeles CA to be specific. I\u2019m part Mexican. I\u2019ve been depressed since the age of 15, maybe even sooner I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019ve always been a shy and calm person, never one to start any problems. Lately my depression has been getting worse and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take jt. I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to at all.\nI do have a girlfriend, I do have family, and I do have \u201cfriends\u201d but they are not the type of people I\u2019d go to for help. Every time I bring up my mental state to my girlfriend she shrugs it off and says I\u2019m over exaggerating or thinking too much. I know she means no disrespect or anything but she just doesn\u2019t understand me and I rather not bother her. And For the most part, my family and friends are just people I have love for but not really people I\u2019d sit down and talk with one on one. \nI have a shitty job with shitty pay and live in a shitty neighborhood. My job makes my depression even worse. I work at subway not because I want to but because no other jobs wants to give me a chance. I did graduate high school but I dropped out of college because I need to pay my bills, etc. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to get out of this dump but it\u2019s near impossible. Every shot I get at a potential new job I end up blowing it. Either too good to be true or I\u2019m not the right fit. Subway makes me very very angry and fills me with rage because of how busy it is. I get very tilted as soon as I see a customer come in just because I end up falling behind on my work and I end up leaving late. My boss and manager are the some of the trashing people I\u2019ve been pushed around by and I have some very lazy and bad co workers. \nI often work from 3pm-10:30pm everyday except Thursday. My only day off. Everyday I wake up sad tired depressed looking forward to my terrible day of work.\nThere\u2019s not many things that make me happy except getting out of work and getting payed but that one lasts for so long. I could keep typing and typing but I\u2019m currently on my break and just wanted to let some steam out.\nThe point of this post was to see if there was anyone out there who can help suggest give advice (anything) to me. I\u2019m very lonely deep down and I feel like giving up on life everyday. Male or female i would love to talk to anyone available (just because I have a girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean Im avoiding other women. As a matter of fact I feel like they could be of much more help... giving me advice on my relationship)\nThank you to anyone who read this I really appreciate it considering the fact that I took 20 minutes to type this and I\u2019m not even done lol",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little bit about myself I\u2019m a 21 year old male. Born in the US. Los Angeles CA to be specific. I\u2019m part Mexican. I\u2019ve been depressed since the age of 15, maybe even sooner I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019ve always been a shy and calm person, never one to start any problems. Lately my depression has been getting worse and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take jt. I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to at all.\nI do have a girlfriend, I do have family, and I do have \u201cfriends\u201d but they are not the type of people I\u2019d go to for help. Every time I bring up my mental state to my girlfriend she shrugs it off and says I\u2019m over exaggerating or thinking too much. I know she means no disrespect or anything but she just doesn\u2019t understand me and I rather not bother her. And For the most part, my family and friends are just people I have love for but not really people I\u2019d sit down and talk with one on one. \nI have a shitty job with shitty pay and live in a shitty neighborhood. My job makes my depression even worse. I work at subway not because I want to but because no other jobs wants to give me a chance.

The longer I go without numbing myself, the more I see that I don\u2019t know how to be myself. When I think about myself, all I can see is mistakes. I don\u2019t know how to forgive myself. The only way I know how to be happy is by doing things for other people. I am constantly trying to compensate for all of my guilt. It started in high school when my first relationship ended and I have been stuck in this cycle of guilt, to drug abuse and then more mistakes ever since. I tried to talk to a professional about this cycle before, I tried to explain everything right from the beginning and I was ignored. She just kept going back to the difference between thoughts and actions, how we have control over our actions and that is what I need to focus on. I have so much pain, it is overwhelming and I can\u2019t focus on anything else. I try my best to control my actions but it isn\u2019t enough. I don\u2019t know how to do any better than how I\u2019ve acted around you. The entire time I\u2019ve known you I\u2019ve tried my hardest and I still make mistakes.

I wish I could show her.\u201d I know that\u2019s not true because I don\u2019t know who that best self is. I am completely lost and I don\u2019t know how to find myself. I\u2019m trying to take it one step at a time. I know I have to start with sobriety, but after that I have no idea where to go next. I have small things that I enjoy doing, but nothing that makes me feel at peace with myself. When I\u2019ve spent time with you I feel something different. It\u2019s more than happiness, but it\u2019s not inner peace or love. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. You call it, \u201ca different kind of connection,\u201d and you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never felt it before, and I don\u2019t understand it at all. But I do enjoy that feeling more than any other feeling I can find. I feel like I have no one that I can completely trust. I can\u2019t be open with my mom about how I\u2019m struggling more than I ever have in my life. I can\u2019t put her into a constant state of anxiety, worrying about me in another city, making her feel powerless. She\u2019s exactly like me with her emotions. I can\u2019t talk to my dad about anything. Everything is a criticism. I told him about being sober and all he did was criticize me for vaping. There was nothing, not even a good for you. My sister has a deep resentment for me, and only cares about her own life. I can\u2019t trust you completely. I have this constant anxiety that I\u2019ll never hear or see from you again. And this fear that you don\u2019t mean anything you say. That you just say what you think is the right thing to say and it is all meaningless. I still do trust you more than anyone else, but I\u2019m constantly scared that I\u2019m being lied to and I could be thrown away at any time. I know you have a lot going on and that I\u2019m more than you can handle. But I really need a true friend that I can trust one hundred percent. Someone to do normal things with and make small moments of joy. Someone to talk both lightly and seriously with, without being scared of being judged. I don\u2019t want to be an emotional burden, but I know that I am. If you can be a friend that I can trust completely I think it would help me start to be a better person. I know you would call me out when I am making mistakes, and I would like it if you could do that before I make them. I would like to be able to spend time with you, relax and have fun together. You used to tell me that you were always here if I needed a friend. But you haven\u2019t for a while now, and right now I need it more than ever. I\u2019m trying my best to be honest with myself right now. What I\u2019ve just said is my absolute best right now, I have nothing else left.

It's like I'm scared to leave the house and be around people but I KNOW nothing will happen to me if I do and no one will mess with me but I can't stop the FEELING even though I KNOW better.\n\nI'm terrified of the thought of becoming dependant on a drug and I've heard they only work for a few years and then you end up having to try to go through getting off them which makes it all that much worse.\n\nI feel like any time I get intoxicated rather it be marijuana or alcohol or shrooms or acid (don't do the last two anymore but I have before) I feel okay like the knots in my brain untangle and I can think as long as I'm not in my normal state of mind. I don't desire alcohol, I don't desire weed, but anything that makes me not feel this way is something I desire. My attitude towards that makes me all that much more scared of potentially starting antidepressants or anxiety or whatever my crazy ass needs.\n\nHave you taken any of these? How long?

We really hit it off, which is a first for me, and I caught feelings. Alex did too. We talked almost every day and went on dates, but unfortunately around finals in December my schedule got crazy and my phone broke so I couldn't talk to her for a week or two. \n\nAfter finals were over I texted Alex and we chatted for a bit. An hour later, I see a picture of her and this girl on Instagram. I'm not the jealous type, but it was kinda weird to me that the caption was \"My baby\". Alex had tagged the girl, so I clicked on her account and the first thing I see is a picture of Alex and the girl kissing, like full on kissing, on my phone. Even thinking about it makes my stomach drop. I texted her angrily about it and she apologized for \"hurting me\" and said she \"isn't normally like this\". I blocked her and spent the rest of the day crying in bed.\n\nThat day literally obliterated my last shred of confidence. That was the first time I've ever had someone reciprocate feelings for me, and she cheated on me. I feel like such an idiot for letting myself believe that someone loved me and actually cared, but of course she realized what garbage I am and left me for a girl ten times prettier. I don't think I can recover from this. My life has been spiraling out of control and this was the last straw. Everyone keeps telling me \"it gets better\" but I've been waiting so many goddamn years for it to get better and it never does. I don't know what to do.",

I could barely focus in school, I didn't care too much about the state of my room and about taking care of things I needed to do. If my anxiety wasn't so high (which was making sure I always did my work on time and held me accountable due to worrying what other people thought of me), I think I would've hit bottom a long time ago. My anxiety is still here, but I don't care as much about anything. My room is disgusting, I can't fall asleep, I wake up early, and yet somehow I still manage to sleep like 12 hours a day. It's taken me 2 weeks to do a single project that I could have had done in 2 days. My friends wanted to hang out, but when I couldn't go, I found out I didn't really care that I wasn't there, but at the same time felt like they didn't care about me, which is stupid. I also have to get a job so I have a decent amount in the bank when I start college in the fall, and that's only adding to this whole mess. Everything is confusing, I don't know what feelings are anxiety, what ones are depression. I don't want to go back to school and hide all this again, and go back to doing my work and acting like the perfectly happy and smart and dependable student I know I'm not. I'm afraid of my friends and my family finding out about how I'm feeling. I don't want things to get worse, but considering it's only taken 2 weeks for me to go from only mildly depressed to whatever the hell is happening now, I'm not very hopeful. I feel like the dam just broke when I was at home, because I didn't have a lot of work to keep my busy, and could hide in my room most of the time, meaning I didn't really have to act okay most of the time like I do in school. But now that everything's out I don't think I can put it back. I really want to enjoy the last of my senior year, but I don't have the willpower or the energy to make sure that happens. Anything I know I can do to help myself just seems out of reach, no matter how small.",

As I have social anxiety, people around me kind of stimulate me. Maybe that\u2018s the reason why I\u2018m not getting depressed when people or friends are around me. Or it\u2018s just the typical effect of distraction.\n\nTo my question: What would you say out of your experience? Is it normal to feel those side effects beginning the higher dose of 300mg wellbutrin? Is it a sign that the dosage might be too high, that I should stop, that the medicament is not the right one for me? \n\nThe depressive phases are very bad. I\u2018m in Europe, here it\u2019s 6 am right now, and I just woke up at 5 with bad symptoms of depression and future anxiety.\n\nThank you for your attention!",

I'm hoping to find in this community that I am not alone as I feel. I'm not asking for attention or anything like that. This is purely a place to express my thoughts. Enough with the introduction, here I go.\n\nAfter a recent breakup with my girlfriend of a couple years, I find myself wanting the love and compassion that I now realize, I took for granted. I live alone in a decent sized apartment. I see the empty rooms day in and day out. I sit on my couch every evening putting on a cliche show on netflix or whatever service I decide use that night. I use Tinder and I get a few hits here and there but that is all they are. I don't have the confidence to meet most of the girls, let alone do anything physical. But that's fine, I'm not one for meaningless sexual interaction. It's not me. I go to work everyday, put a smile on my face, act like I am not drowning on the inside. But that's okay. I make my money, I'm polite, and I go home, to an empty space. \n\nI lost my feeling a little bit so I am sorry my post ended upbruptly. Hang with me as I figure out how Reddit works and the proper formatting I should use. If you took the time to read my hodgepodge of emotional writing and you relate, please let me know. If you can comment, then comment and maybe we can talk about it. I can't say how often I will be on here, depends on the social settings I am in as I am trying my best to remain anonymous.

A snake wrapped himself around me and I was transfixed for a moment on the possibility of a lifetime, only to realize that all he really wanted last night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I ran. I ran to paradise. I ran to rainbows. I ran to island breeze. I can breathe a little easier here, but I found what I always find: me. The overweight wannabe creative. The clothes too tight, lips too loose, awkward weirdo, who spills coffee way too often. That\u2019s who I am, and the older I get the more ok with it I suppose I am. But now that I\u2019m finally being honest with myself, maybe change can actually start.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Recently, I was fixing my sleep schedule, and advice I heard was to use your bed only for sleeping. She was having problems sleeping, so I suggested that she used her bed only for sleeping. Turns out she ruminated before going to sleep because she spent all her time in bed (even when she wasn't ruminating), and getting out of bed got her out of 'rumination space'.\n\nShe's well into recovery and is very open and able to take suggestions. Do you guys have any habits to get into which help just a little bit? The \"don't do your stuff in bed\" wasn't hard for her (she moved to her desk) and it helped, and I'm looking for other low-hanging fruit. Anything helps, even if it's real small: doing something which does't work feels better than doing nothing, yanno?\n\nSorry for the throwaway, but it's not my privacy on the line here! Thank you!",

I'm an introvert and not really good at social interaction. I had about four friends in high school but we all went separate ways and I barely talk to them anymore. I've yet to make a friend in college due to my lack of social skills and my shyness. My only true friend in life is my brother, who's older than me. All good things come to an end eventually and things get more and more serious with his longtime girlfriend, so I'm not his top priority anymore. They're thinking about moving out, so I'll lose my closest friend (and one can say my only true friend) when they do. I come from a conservative family and we never talk about our feelings and we never did.\n\nThe Holidays were a reminder of my solitude. I spent New Year's Eve with my brother's friends because I don't have any friends on my own. All they talked about was sex and relationships. I've never had a relationship and never even kissed a girl, so I felt excluded and left early, spending New Year's Eve alone in my bed, crying. \n\nTo come back to my lack of relationship, this is what makes me feel like I'm wasting my life. It's sad to say, but my brother's happiness makes me feel miserable. I feel like I'll never get to cherish the same thing he does and be alone for the rest of my life. I wouldn't consider myself attractive and I've never known anyone who was attracted to me, ever. I've tried all the dating apps imaginable, Tinder, Bumble, Fruitz, POF, Facebook, name it. I've never had a single match. It makes me feel miserable and I get the feeling like I'm going to die alone. \n\nEver since the New Year's Eve episode, I feel a general sadness and I've lost my appetite. The things I previously enjoyed don't have the same effect on me. I feel like I'm drowning in my own sadness. \n\nI know some of you will suggest to me to go out and meet someone. I come from a small town where everyone knows each other, but I can't go to the city, because my conservative parents won't let me and I can't pretend like I'm hanging out with my friends, because I don't have any. \n\nI just want to find someone who will understand me and help me find my will to live again, but I don't see how it's possible. \n\nHelp me Reddit, I'm begging you, I really need your help before something bad happens to me.",

         "selftext": "I spend a good amount of my time worry about both my mental and physical health. I guess you could call it Illness Anxiety disorder. People constantly tell me to chill out, and to not worry. How am I not supposed to worry about my damn health when I have to live with it constantly, and how am I not supposed to worry about my damn health when it could have far reaching complications that could potentially change my life for the worse in the long term. \n\nSome background: \n\nI got into the Drugs scene in college in the first part of 2019. Primarily with psychedelia and marijuana. Being from an illegal state, it was all about being discrete and keeping your marijuana products as lowkey as possible. That being said, THC vape pens; primarily Dank Vapes, Kingpens, Brass Knuckles, GoHards, and pretty much every other black market brand out there was \"the thing to do\" amongst us college sophomores for our recreational time. Being an absolute health nut, I refused to get into the opioid or stimulant scene because of how detrimental it good be for both your physical and mental health, instead opting to do the other things because of good things I heard about it. \n\nI loved Marijuana vape products. Loved them so much that I would almost constantly use them every single of my life for a good 2-3 months, not really caring what was in them or the long term effects of them. As far as I was concerned, it got me high and made me feel good, so I could care less. And everyone was doing them, so what's the harm right, no one else is getting hurt. (should've paid more attention to the drug education during high school) \n\nFast forward to May. I was attempting to try as many marijuana cartridge black market brands as I could possibly do. Much to my shock there was a brand called GoHard Pest Free Clear Cartridges. I didn't know it at the time but something was incredibly off about this cartridge. It tasted like burnt plastic and made me extremely, if not uncomfortably high. I knew nothing or had completely forgotten about Spice/K2 and synthetic cannabinoids during this time period so it never really crossed my mind that this may have been a synthetic cannabinoid tank. Of course like a dumbass I smoked little more than half of it through daily usage. Even after I let my girlfriend try it, in which she vomited and went almost in a \"tripping\" state, I thought nothing of it, like maybe she was just a lightweight. Normal Cannabis Carts don't do that, now I know. \n\nOf course to augment my high and to satisfy my \"munchies,\" I would eat fried chicken and cup of noodles practically every single day. My health deteriorated as such and I didn't even notice it. My weight skyrocketed and my cognitive ability declined sharply. Tried DXM and combined with LSD once after that and my mind fell off a cliff. \n\nIn june I was admitted to the mental health hospital for delusions and nausea in addition to heavy visual snow. Every moment I had during the day I would constantly research diseases, medical conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, and genetic defects. On top of that, I wasn't suicidal but I couldn't stop dwelling about how nasty I felt. The Doctors in the Psychiatric ward pumped me full of antipsychotics, not limited to seroquel, olanzapine, abilify and so on. Nothing worked. Nothing at all. Cognitive ability continued to rapidly shift and I ended up an obsessive vegetable with extreme mental whiplash as to how I reached this point in my life. \n\nThankfully, In the the psychiatric hospital I was released under the condition that my parents would take me halfway across the country back home. Made it home without issue. Life from that point forward has been absolute hell. \n\nMy mental health has improved yes, but its been an uphill battle, and honestly it tires me out. Writing things like this are therapeutic because it reminds me of the journey that it took me to get to this point. \n\nOk back to my story. \n\nFast forward to home. I was forced to meet with a psychiatrist that prescribed me Zyprexa for my issues. Of course, not knowing any better, I thought this would be a one-stop solution that would suddenly fix all my obsessions. \n\nThe olanzapine did nothing more than cut down on my mental capacity and made me further dwell on the possibility that I had early onset dementia, something like brain cancer, or ALS. So after two months of a constant fight within my head, wrestling the issue, I determined that it wasn't for me, and it was only harming me. Once I discontinued it and switched to a regimen of antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and thankfully I began to see some progress. My mental capacity gradually improved, and my mindstate as well began to improve. \n\nIn the place of fear, and sadness came anger towards those psychiatrists and people who constantly pumped with medication. I continued my research on diseases on different neurodegenerative conditions in an attempt to use knowledge as an antipsychotic for my condition. \n\nFast forward to today, why am I writing this post? \n\nWell I am extremely concerned that those synthetic cannabinoids that I smoked are responsible for my issue and I cannot stop obsessing about it. It crosses my mind every single moment of the day that Synthetic cannabinoids, or a large amount of them are Genotoxic and Carcinogenic. I ask myself, what if the genotoxic compounds damaged my Neuronal DNA and what if as a result I well end up with a neurodegenerative disorder such frontotemporal lobe dementia or ALS or even Parkinsons? Obviously these substances bind to Cannabinoid receptors in the brain and its established through some well regarded research to be toxic to throat and lung cells, why wouldn't that same genotoxicity apply to neurons as well? and If so, doesn't that mean that I am fucked? \n\nEvery time I obsess above the stuff above, it sends me into an almost depressive state in which I really really want to end my life because I really don't want to find out, or rather I don't want to be in pain and don't want my family to deal with my shit if something like that actually happens. Then another part of me comes in and tells me that DNA and neurons have repair mechanisms or something like Neurons aren't affected by genotoxic compounds the same way that lung and throat cells are affected. But I really don't know. It's the unknown, and I'm not a qualified Geneticist, so I really can't say anything on the matter, which drives me mad, and ultimately makes me feel hopeless. **I'm obsessing about the possibilities and it's making me feel lifeless.** How would I even know that i'm affected by such disorders, how do I know that I didn't fuck myself over by willingly smoke genotoxic compounds. Lab results and MRIs don't show anything out of the ordinary and yet the worry still persists in my mind, making me sick and depressed. \n\nYes I know that's its my fault that I got into doing these substances in the first place and honestly it might just be karma that I'm getting hit with all these mental issues, but I never imagined just how horrible things would be. I'm not crazy, I'm not schizophrenic, I don't feel like I want to stab someone, I just want to know If I'm sick with a disease or not! The fact that people are willing to pump me with antipsychotics for just having questions is absolutely mental, I wish that there was a more effective way to screen the body for defects or things that could put at risk for certain diseases/neurodegenerative disorders. That is the only thing holding me back in life, and I keep getting two types of nightmares. One of them is that I do have a neurodegenerative disorder and I'll be dead in a couple of years, another of them is that I don't and I continue to obsess about them, ultimately ending up homeless. \n\nIt's been six months since my symptoms started and I feel as if I haven't gotten any worse. Visual snow is still there and I get occasionally nauseous. My parents think I have improved as well. The concern though persists, how do I really know that I'm safe and how do I live my life if that possibility is always there, even though i'm only 20? Genotoxicity is no fucking joke and it scares the fuck out of me. \n\nHere is the article I spent too much time reading on:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/) \n\nWill I spend the rest of my life worrying about the possibility of disease? This is not how I want to live. I want to just know, and get on with my time here on this world.",

I have legal action against the college, but it hardly matters, and was forced to attend an institution which I view as second-rate. Compared to my great amount of friends, clubs, and fulfilling academic life at my old University, I now feel entirely lost (it's more of a commuter school), and as if I've wasted my entire collegiate life. I hardly put effort into classes, I have no relationships with my professors, and have very few friends at this University or new city in general. \n\nMy second issue is a sort of great disconnect I feel between myself and people with whom I attempt to socialize. It's extremely difficult for me to put into words, but I very well may be autistic given the inability I have to judge people's emotional state, expressions, sincerity, etc. In short, people I think despise me really don't mind me, and vice versa. It's caused me to revert back to socializing more with a no-good gang of losers from my old school who, at the very least, I understand emotionally. I have no idea how to connect with others, and I quite literally spent a few hours the other day just thinking about the \"idea\" of friendships. In a literal sense it makes sense to me, but on an emotional basis, I'm entirely lost.\n\nI know my issues are not at all unusual for symptoms of depression, but I really have no idea where to start.

I\u2019ve overcome a great deal of negativity and have learned to handle depressed feelings with mindfulness and compassion exercises.  The thing is, my parents have become obsessed with my mental health.  They\u2019re constantly psychoanalyzing me and criticizing my behaviour.  And whenever I get defensive in regards to their incessant opinions they act as if I\u2019m being ungrateful and I don\u2019t care that they care.  They say they\u2019re doing it out of love but honestly, \u201cthe road to hell can be paved with good intentions\u201d.  I\u2019m sick of these people acting like my nurses.  I just want my parents back, instead of the \u201cnurses\u201d they\u2019ve become.  The worst part about this situation is that they\u2019re so obsessed with my mental health that they\u2019re completely ignoring their own.  I honestly think they\u2019re probably doing worse than I am.  And they blame me for it.  Not explicitly but implicitly in the things they say like, \u201cwhen you suffer, we suffer.\u201d  That\u2019s just absolutely crazy.  Because when they think that way, the act in a way that just increases my agitation creating a vicious feedback loop.  Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the funds to move out of the house since I\u2019m young and still in college.  But I want to get some good distance from these people because this situation is toxic and dysfunctional.  Anyone have any advice on the matter?  I don\u2019t have many people that can relate to this, so I came here.  It feels so oppressive since I can\u2019t move out.  I tried to recently but I didn\u2019t have the money or frame of mind at the time to make it work.  I honestly feel like this is the only solution.  For their good and my own good.  They\u2019ll start to heal their mental health issues once I leave and they drop a little bit of their obsessiveness with me.  Because they won\u2019t have an object for their \u201ccare\u201d anymore and they\u2019ll be forced to realize that they\u2019re miserable regardless of whether or not I am doing wonderful or not.",

The thing is, my parents have become obsessed with my mental health.  They\u2019re constantly psychoanalyzing me and criticizing my behaviour.  And whenever I get defensive in regards to their incessant opinions they act as if I\u2019m being ungrateful and I don\u2019t care that they care.  They say they\u2019re doing it out of love but honestly, \u201cthe road to hell can be paved with good intentions\u201d.  I\u2019m sick of these people acting like my nurses.  I just want my parents back, instead of the \u201cnurses\u201d they\u2019ve become.  The worst part about this situation is that they\u2019re so obsessed with my mental health that they\u2019re completely ignoring their own.  I honestly think they\u2019re probably doing worse than I am.  And they blame me for it.  Not explicitly but implicitly in the things they say like, \u201cwhen you suffer, we suffer.\u201d  That\u2019s just absolutely crazy.  Because when they think that way, the act in a way that just increases my agitation creating a vicious feedback loop.  Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the funds to move out of the house since I\u2019m young and still in college.  But I want to get some good distance from these people because this situation is toxic and dysfunctional.  Anyone have any advice on the matter?  I don\u2019t have many people that can relate to this, so I came here.  It feels so oppressive since I can\u2019t move out.  I tried to recently but I didn\u2019t have the money or frame of mind at the time to make it work.  I honestly feel like this is the only solution.  For their good and my own good.  They\u2019ll start to heal their mental health issues once I leave and they drop a little bit of their obsessiveness with me.  Because they won\u2019t have an object for their \u201ccare\u201d anymore and they\u2019ll be forced to realize that they\u2019re miserable regardless of whether or not I am doing wonderful or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I hate it but I get fairly jealous when someone I have feelings for is with someone else, and idk what to do about it. Idk... there\u2019s definitely ways for me to fix this but.. I think I\u2019m just scared to do anything. I\u2019ve been so down this last year, just feel like I\u2019m missing someone but my insecurities hold me back and push me even further&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I know that life is full of people that can't give more than a shit about you, and I have plenty of it left to go through.

Even to the few people i came to truly love, it was the same thing. I have a very active libido, sure. But is it so wrong to just want to have someone that's there for more than that? \n\nI have all of one friend in my life. I love her more than anything. When we met, it was all online. But she's been there for me, more so than anyone in my life. I recently flew to her country to visit for a whole montj. If it's not obvious I'm in love with her, I dunno what else I should do. \n\nBut she already has someone. It's stupid to be so upset over it, but I am. I'm happy for her, of course I want her to be happy. It's all that really matters for me anymore. Make sure she's safe, happy. \n\nShe said she felt the same. For a moment. \n\nA moment. \n\nI had heard that before. It's always just for a moment. It hurts so much, even if I knew that would be the case. Always knew it would be. \n\nI have the worst luck imaginable when it comes to these things. Having friends, romance. \n\nI hate romance nowadays. Every time I've tried, every time she's told me to try, it's blown up in my face. Put me down into a hole. \n\nDug my heart out further. Dramatic, I know. But it's what it feels like. Like there's this constant grip on it. Squeezing. Especially when I think of her smile. \n\nHow much I wish I could be the reason for it. \n\nNothing feels good anymore. I feel sick to my stomach constantly. Smiling feels so forced when it's not with her. Even then, I have to search for a real smile at times. \n\nIt's so stupid to get this way over something that seems so simple, right? I'm a mess over a woman who's spoken for. A mess over everyone who shouldn't matter because they didn't care. \n\nI'm a tragedy. And I know I'll die alone. My lifespan isn't all that long anymore, anyway. Maybe it's for the best that I just forget about having something more. \n\nI know that this was just a weird, rambling bit of text. Frankly, I don't expect much of anyone to bother reading.

I lost my 1st one becuz he acts above everyone online but hes nice irl. Me and him were just chatting after i had blocked and unblocked him several times and he thing that set it of is that he told me to stop bothering him im real sensitive to stuff like this. Then i spammed i should get new friends then he said i should i kept spamming and he threatened to get me banned for spamming. I another not to long ago becuz his cousin didnt like me so he ignored me for 2 days then i asked him to invite me to a party but his cousin was in it and \"He doesn't want  to talk to you\" he says so then i unfriended him and left chat. They might know i am depressed or maybe not cuz i always acted happy around them. Now im mute at school we knew eachother since kindergarten now idk what table to sit at now im not asking for pity i just need to vent noone in my family knows im depressed or wanted to killmyself i dont depend on my friends for emotional support becuz i have tried to receive pity from them but they didnt care and my friend with an ego always shows off his expensive stuff and when i do it he says no one cares or makes fun of me these sound like shitty friends right? But before we were friends nline we were happy oh yeah my friend got a iphone11 and took it to school and all the girls got and asked for his number well good thing almost eveyone is related to him cuz we live on a indian owned land and everyone goes to a natives only school just so you know most of us natives are assholes.

I lost my 1st one becuz he acts above everyone online but hes nice irl. Me and him were just chatting after i had blocked and unblocked him several times and he thing that set it of is that he told me to stop bothering him im real sensitive to stuff like this. Then i spammed i should get new friends then he said i should i kept spamming and he threatened to get me banned for spamming. I another not to long ago becuz his cousin didnt like me so he ignored me for 2 days then i asked him to invite me to a party but his cousin was in it and &amp;quot;He doesn&amp;#39;t want  to talk to you&amp;quot; he says so then i unfriended him and left chat. They might know i am depressed or maybe not cuz i always acted happy around them.

And kind of just the whole thing threw me for a (bit of)  a loop cause she hadn't told me this before, she mentioned it and I asked a lot about it and she was hesitant to tell me cause she said she didn't want to be a burden and I said that relationships work by sharing stress with your partner, it helps relieve it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure how badly depressed she is cause she doesn't usually act like she \"feels like shit\" as she put it, but obviously it is very easy to miss signs of depressed people so that is no indicator to me so it might be worse than what she told me.",

And kind of just the whole thing threw me for a (bit of)  a loop cause she hadn&amp;#39;t told me this before, she mentioned it and I asked a lot about it and she was hesitant to tell me cause she said she didn&amp;#39;t want to be a burden and I said that relationships work by sharing stress with your partner, it helps relieve it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how badly depressed she is cause she doesn&amp;#39;t usually act like she &amp;quot;feels like shit&amp;quot; as she put it, but obviously it is very easy to miss signs of depressed people so that is no indicator to me so it might be worse than what she told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019m such a failure that 14 suicide attempts have failed to put me down.  Everything from hanging to pills, I\u2019m still fucking alive for some reason.  So I\u2019m going to tell everyone on this lovely subreddit about how I ended up like this.  It all started in 2017.  I\u2019m a retarded 7th grader and life\u2019s going okay.  Then I got my first girlfriend!  That was awesome.  Yeah yeah, stupid jr high shit and then we broke up.  This made me sad as fuck but it was nothing too bad.  So 8th grade and 2018 role around and life\u2019s looking better.  I\u2019m more of an asshole, and a cynic but life\u2019s going alright still.  So then around the end of eighth grade I started dating this girl, I ended it only a couple weeks into the relationship because I just wasn\u2019t into.  I spent the next couple weeks being harassed by her friends because I was a shitty person.  Yeah nothing I didn\u2019t know.  THEN me and my best friend at the time ended up liking the same girl.  Nothing terrible, honestly not the worst thing in the world.  On the other hand how we went about dealing with the situation really fucked me up.  We decided for some reason that it was best to just wait it out and see who she would pick.  That was the worst fucking idea any of us could\u2019ve had.  I wanted out of the situation but no the girl and my friend both roped me back into this shit and had me stay involved.  It was literal months of me just saying I give up go be with my friend, and eventually I just fucking snapped.  I might be a pussy for this but I just couldn\u2019t fucking deal with it.  Long story short I get sent to a psych ward and shit I end up back out in the real world now seeing a therapist every week, and yeah yeah you get the picture.  Life starts to look up around here and I get into highschool.  Highschool is fucking awesome.  Greatest time I\u2019ve had in my short life so far.  Honestly amazing.  I started dating a sophomore who was a bitch and who I really shouldn\u2019t have been with from the start.  She cheated on me and blamed it on me for having mental health issues.  That was less fun.  Over the summer my grandmother died, my great uncle died, my other grandparents got into a car accident, and I tried long distance dating which didn\u2019t work out.  I\u2019m still trying long distance and hoping this time it works out.  Now I\u2019m on meds and don\u2019t give a shit.  I plan on joining the marines and dying by age 25 at most.  Thank you for reading.",

And I\u2019m doing everything I can to make myself attractive enough to do so - I\u2019ve *been* doing it - but it\u2019s just not happening.

I\u2019ve only ever had one girlfriend. We broke up just over a year ago, and we were only together for about 8 months. That was the only time since high school that I felt happy. And I feel like I\u2019m never going to get that again. I don\u2019t live my life in a way where I\u2019ll meet anyone.

If it\u2019s a rest day, or it\u2019s not study season, I\u2019ll just go straight home.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get hot enough to use tinder, but I\u2019m going bald. I went to a hair surgeon for a consultation and found out I\u2019m beyond help. I get almost no matches. The only matches I get are from super likes, and they never respond to more than 2 messages - because super likes lead the other to match with you out of guilt. I used tinder for a year, almost consistently throughout, and never went on a single date from it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to write. I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve tried three times now, and just deleted everything each time, because everything is so tangled together. I hate this",
