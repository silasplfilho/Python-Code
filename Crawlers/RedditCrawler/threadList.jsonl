My home life leaves much to be desired (still living with parents; they have a sub-par relationship themselves), and years of isolation and anxiety have lead to zero friends, other than some workplace acquaintances. I feel like I'm mature enough for dating (and especially for just new friends), but I think I have some long-term c-PTSD that triggers when I try to get out of my comfort zone. I am almost at the point where I think the only way for a relationship to work is if the other person has a similar past or trauma, and we want to work through it together.** \n\nFYI there's a lot to unpack here, so I'm using a throwaway account. For reference, I live in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities, Minnesota if anyone has any local ideas for me. \n\n# About me\n\nFirst, some details and general positivity to kick things off. 29M, tall, thin/fit (and working on ramping up fitness more!), introverted, and have a solid job. I think I'm pretty good at what I do, and I believe I'm well respected in the work place. I think I'm pretty attractive too, and other must agree, because several coworkers keep trying to set me up with people (and they don't know me / my type AT ALL lol). I must give off the whole \"how is this guy still single?\" vibe, which at times is flattering. My work life is one thing, but that's where things fall apart...\n\nWhen I go home, I feel like in sink into a malaise. Depression sinks in, and just the thought of going out is exhausting most days, and often times triggers anxiety. I put a lot into what I do at work, and being a type B person I am completely drained by the end of the day, or even through the weekend. Instead of going out and doing things 2-3 times a week like I aspire to (hobbies, shopping, etc.), it's more like 4-5 times a month. \n\nOne thing that I can't mentally get over is that I live with my parents. They are good people, and help me any way they can, but they've had their own history of a somewhat toxic relationship, and I feel like I'm in the middle of it (or holding the entire marriage together by living there). Living with them is extremely challenging. My father (who has been unemployed for over a decade) is very controlling and micromanages the whole house (not exaggerating). He is a type B person also, and my mother is completely, completely the opposite. She is a total type A person, and it's gotten to the point (through his control and micromanaging) where she is becoming a shut-in like me. Her friends, family, and coworkers are not allowed to visit our house, and anytime she's tried to go out after work it's always the '20 questions' game afterwards. As for me, anytime I want people over (not often), I'm told I'm always \"allowed to\", but I always shy away from it because everything is so awkward; it's like years of control and heated arguments (either between myself and my parents, or between the pair of them) have led to me feeling bad for wanting to socialize. Some of this stems from my own social anxiety, but there is definitely some deep-seeded thing happening because of my home life too. \n\nMy extended family is much worse. We don't attend holidays anymore, as both my mothers and fathers sides of the family are toxic. Chemical dependency strong runs through both bloodlines, as does anxiety and depression, which has led to vast majority of my family becoming alcoholics as a coping mechanism. We also have a strong history of chemical sensitivity (along with addiction), which makes things like anti-anxiety or anti-depressants something I refuse to try (I've seen several family members have bad reactions). This is also why I've chosen to better myself through my health choices (not that I'm perfect, but fitness is something that I choose to make a priority). All in all I don't have a family other than my parents, or my fathers parents (who are also good people). One good thing is that my parents have actively chosen not to drink, smoke, or take any addicting medications. \n\nI have a problem with physical touch too. Over the years, every time my mother would go to put a hand on my shoulder, or hug me, or embrace me in any way, my father would nudge her away, angrily saying something like \"knock it off\" or \"quit goofing around\" (even from an early age). This is the same way my father would react to my mother's embrace, and I believe these reactions towards my mother and I were a result of his disgust with her and his marriage. Without spelling it out, I'll just say they've been in separate rooms for years until recently (and even so he refuses any physical contact from anyone). Over years and years of reinforcement of this behavior, I have become very sensitive to touch myself. More accurately, any psychical contact triggers immediate anxiety. I feel attraction and lust, but I simultaneously feel shame, embarrassment, anxiety, and basically shut down emotionally. As an example, I went on several dates with a girl (from online dating), and at the end of date #2 she went to embrace me in the parking lot; I immediately tensed up and made sure it was a quick hug and not a kiss. I'm not sure what may or may not have happened after that, but I just wanted it to be over with, even though at some level I do desire physical touch. These feelings leave me very confused, and I'm not sure how to get over this.\n\nOn a positive note, in the past two years or so things have definitely cooled-down with my parents. I've called out my father for what I believe is irrational behavior, and while things still occasionally get heated in the moment, he does usually listen and back off to some degree. Even so, I can't drop these feelings of shame, embarrassment, or constantly doing something wrong, even when my parents are pretty much laying off of my personal business nowadays. I can't exactly explain it, but things just don't feel right when I go to socialize now, and I know  it's more than just my own everyday social anxiety. \n\nYou might say then, \"You need to move out, now!\" but with the current housing costs, I'm struggling to wrap my head around the affordability factor. Yes, I've had the privilege of saving up for a down-payment on a house, but the houses I can reasonably afford are, to put it lightly, problem-ridden. If I was living on my own, one major repair (very likely in my price range) or emergency situation would leave me living check-to-check, and the years of me diligently saving and sacrificing my social life could be just thrown away... Given my lack of support system outside of my parents, I don't have anyone in my life that can move in with me (or that I can move in with), and finding some rando's online would be just way too much for me to handle right now. I know renting is an option, but with basic apartments and town homes around me going for $1500+/month before utilities, I feel like I'd be throwing away my only opportunity to ever own a home. I'm so close to being able to buy, but I just need prices to come down a bit. Ugh. While my social life is frustrating, I have taken the opportunity to do some of the hard stuff early on, like trying to get financially set in an economy that is rough on the middle class and poor. \n\nI have actively chosen to attend therapy to help with these issues, but I wanted to anonymously pull-in other ideas as well. Things are starting to get better for me, but even with some of my recent positive changes, relationships are still something I clearly struggle with.\n\n# Where do I go from here?\n\nAt surface value, I think people see a young, attractive professional that has his life put together. Once I get home, however, it's like imposter syndrome takes over. Like it's all a facade that crumbles away when I'm away from my professional work. Like I'm only as good as my last failure. \n\nI'm almost thinking some of my issues are so complex and deep-seeded that there isn't a way forward for me for a relationship. What do I do? Should I seek someone in a similar position as me? Every time I look on dating sites, or see people out and about, I start thinking about how they look well put together, and wouldn't want to deal with my fussy issues, etc. Then the shame comes, like I'm not supposed to be seeking others. My father always hammered in to me \"50% of marriages end in divorce\". Thanks for the positivity, dad.\n\nOn the other hand, my confidence swings a 180 in the blink of an eye. I've been to several volleyball Meetups in my area, and my experience has always led to me either start cringing at some of the awkward conversations I'm overhearing (with an immediate boost to my confidence; \"OMG I can do this!\"), to seeing that one person I find attractive and turning into a stuttering, bumbling mess, and instantly shutting-down. I wish I could pull my at-work confidence into my personal life. \n\nWhat should I do? What type of people would work for me? What platform would work best to meet people?

After of what happened, I looked up and saw the food prep teacher looking down at my sink, and told me to not touch it. But out of no reason, I didn’t listen to her and decided to touch the bowl in the sink, but I barely touched the glass, and she got even angrier and scolded at me, “(insert my name here, but can’t bc I’m afraid she might read this), I TOLD YOU NOT TO MOVE.”  And so I backed up far away, and I felt really numb because I could already hear the whole class falling into silence and all eyes were on me.  Then at the end of class, I regained my posture and courage to go up to the teacher, and I apologized to her again. I then asked her how much the custard cups costed so that I can pay. And she told me that didn’t matter, she said, “(insert my name) you just need to listen to me more. You NEED TO listen..” and then I just stood there for a couple of seconds kind of traumatized. Finally I walked out the classroom and throughout that whole day, I feel very weakened and sad, traumatized after getting scolded at again. Even though this wasn’t my first time getting scolded at by a teacher. Today was a suckish day, and this day made me reconsider about my suicidal thoughts even more.  I wish I was even more dead. \n\nI told my mom about this and she said one of the reasons why I’m so clumsy like this and keep breaking things is due to how my mind is always busy and not settled or calm. I agree with her, but it’s insanely difficult to keep calm in my mind. I’m constantly talking negative things in my mind, and suicidal thoughts everyday in my mind. I can’t control myself. I never went to a therapist, I want to but my mom won’t ever take me because she doesn’t believe that depression should be taken seriously.

After of what happened, I looked up and saw the food prep teacher looking down at my sink, and told me to not touch it. But out of no reason, I didn’t listen to her and decided to touch the bowl in the sink, but I barely touched the glass, and she got even angrier and scolded at me, “(insert my name here, but can’t bc I’m afraid she might read this), I TOLD YOU NOT TO MOVE.”  And so I backed up far away, and I felt really numb because I could already hear the whole class falling into silence and all eyes were on me.  Then at the end of class, I regained my posture and courage to go up to the teacher, and I apologized to her again. I then asked her how much the custard cups costed so that I can pay. And she told me that didn’t matter, she said, “(insert my name) you just need to listen to me more. You NEED TO listen..” and then I just stood there for a couple of seconds kind of traumatized. Finally I walked out the classroom and throughout that whole day, I feel very weakened and sad, traumatized after getting scolded at again. Even though this wasn’t my first time getting scolded at by a teacher. Today was a suckish day, and this day made me reconsider about my suicidal thoughts even more.  I wish I was even more dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my mom about this and she said one of the reasons why I’m so clumsy like this and keep breaking things is due to how my mind is always busy and not settled or calm. I agree with her, but it’s insanely difficult to keep calm in my mind. I’m constantly talking negative things in my mind, and suicidal thoughts everyday in my mind. I can’t control myself. I never went to a therapist, I want to but my mom won’t ever take me because she doesn’t believe that depression should be taken seriously. Now I have to take it more seriously when I move out and get therapy myself but that’s going to take forever until I graduate from college and get a decent job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this, this is more of a rant. \nI wonder if any of you cannot think clearly, have more of a slower reaction and have trouble listening to what others tell you.

Today school started again and after a month and a week not having to go i went again . And i felt shit again , was scared , could barely pay attention because of all the thoughts but I pushed through.

The laptop broke, this was the crack that broke the camels back (or whatever that saying is) I lost it, sold everything and left my house to 'find myself'... Anyway I live with my mum now for the moment. I returned a few months ago. This afternoon I found my laptop and though why not! And it worked! God knows how, we tried everything at the time. I think maybe having a few years in the draw to dry off haha might hv helped. It was like finding a lost loved one. All the memories, the music of my past, I love music, my photos, (I literally cried) it might sound stupid and yh if it was that important I should have had everything backed up.

I think maybe having a few years in the draw to dry off haha might hv helped. It was like finding a lost loved one.

It was nothing out of the usual, you know how it happens, people just fall apart and i was very young anyways, but it was still sad. Because of the break-up,15 yo sad me though that it would be a great idea to go see a psychologist. So after that i have been going to a psychologist for the last 5 years. I switched 3 psychologists throughout my \"therapy\" journey. \n\nBut the strangest thing kept happening to me and still does that i just can't seem to comprehend and it's me being absolutely emotionless. When i became 16 i started volunteering at events and i made some friends but i lost them very soon, because i didn't really care about them. \n\nAt the time, my only friend that is still my only friend to this day told me that \"you have to care about people in order not to loose them\" but i just can't do that for some reason. I have been actively trying to make friends for the past 4 years and i am struggling, like a lot. Somehow i do manage to meet someone from time to time and i would even say that there is quite a bit of people surrounding me now, but the problem is that i don't care about them. \n\nAll i feel for anyone is numbness. There were instances when people asked me for help with their mental wellbeing, but i just couldn't seem to understand their emotions and problems. The problem was that i just couldn't show any empathy. \n\nTo this day i feel nothing for anyone, even my family members, except 2 people. These 2 people are both my friends (sort of). The first one is my best friend who is the same guy that i mentioned earlier in this post, i am just always happy to see him. The second one is my ex, we still hang out and do some things together, but i have no feelings for her (relationship related), i am just always happy to see her and interact with her. I know how it might sound, pathetic that i am complaining about something when i have 2 people that i sort of care about when there are people with way worse problems than mine. But just for a moment when i go onto any social media platform i see people hanging out together. \n\nAlso i keep hearing stories about people doing thing together. I know some very sociable and popular people, but i just can't seem to understand how they do it. For me it probably wouldn't be a big problem to find people to hang out with, but i would not enjoy it, fact is i wouldn't even care really. FYI i did go to a psychiatrist and i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I even dealt with panic attacks for a while, wasn't fun really, because i didn't know that it was panic attacks and i genuinely thought that i'm going to die each time lol. I used to sit at home and still some times do for days, weeks and sometimes even month without going outside. I excel at university assignments and that's it, i don't do anything else well. People said that i am a really good cook, but i don't know and don't really care tbh. \n\nThing is that i play video game every day and just don't do anything except uni, video games, masturbation and watching videos on youtube. But i occasionally go out into the wild world that is earth and i try as hard as i can to be a good and a caring person towards everybody, but i don't feel anything so i have to fake it every single time. Don't know what's wrong with me at this point, tried everything i could to fix the numbness but it just doesn't go away. Please tell me what to do, i am desperate at this point (i'm not suicidal and i'm kind of used to people telling me to kms, won't work), but any suggestions would be amazing. \n\nThe reason why i am even writing this post is because it just can't last, this numbness has to go away because i want to live a normal life.

It started off by having a 'breakdown' bursting into uncontrollable tears with no explanation at the time. The breakdowns could last from 10 minutes to literally 7 hours. I spent whole days off college, laying on my bedroom floor crying my eyes out all day long. It even got to the point of occasionally scream and then laughing.\n\nI then started to feel worse. The real fun was soon to begin. my mental decline swiftly fell through the floor. Having public breakdowns in college. I just felt awful but still no explanation.\n\nI got suspended from my job as a Lifeguard due to breakdowns being too dangerous on pool side because if I was a cabbage as someone was drowning they'd die and I'd go to jail, as well as the company being sued. so they suspended me until I got 'better'... I never lifeguarded on my own again. I became a bartender in october of 2018. and I quit my job as a lifeguard/swimming teacher. My breakdowns started getting worse so I went to the doctors and got pescribed with severe depression. I began taking anti depressants that then caused me to have partial insomnia where I wouldn't sleep for literally 4 days straight. \n\nThat Christmas was living hell. I didnt move out of my bed from Christmas eve to boxing day. Crying constantly, not eating or talking to anyone. I mean why would I talking to anyone? why ruin their fucking Christmas? The day after boxing day. I tried to kill myself, I tried to drown myself in the bathtub.\n\nMid january rolled around and I felt like I was going fully insane. The occasional voices in my head, taunting me from the shadows. Dreams of alternate history or potential futures. my life had then become one Giant breakdown... (SPOILER; still hasn't stopped) one night after days without sleep I had finally gotten to sleep. However I had one nightmare, and every time I woke up and went back to sleep it continued from where it left off. The dream was my parents had decided to get me sectioned and the doctors had tried all the medication to get me to sleep and nothing worked, so their solution was to cut and bleed me until I passed out. I woke up and continued this dream about 5 times that night.\n\nafter this I was so scared to sleep I called the doctors and got on a waiting list for therapy. While on the waiting list again I attempted to kill myself twice, once again in the bath and the other by walking infront of a lorry (that one was awfully close)\n\nTherapy was amazing however it was too short. The therapist I had was very very skilled, and just genuinely amazing. and if I were to go back I'd want her. During therapy however, things piled up very quickly. The people I held closest to me abandoned me, I had to quit my job because it was causing me to have more and more breakdowns while not paying me enough or giving me enough hours. I became more and more lonely. and among this my anxiety began going off the charts. \n\nAfter therapy ended things went downhill very fast, and what was worse was I thought I was at the bottom when I tried to kill myself 3 times. If I ever went out rather than getting a bit drunk or tipsy i'd get black out fucking drunk. so drunk that you wake up with an empty bank, naked in your room with a bottle of bourbon in your hands and some insane scrawling that partially resembles words in your journal of madness. This was mainly August 2019 onwards.\n\nI became more and more anxious about being a 20 year old virgin. not because its a bad thing, or sad or whatever. but just the fact it hasn't happened. Im a very impatient person. I just want it gone. my anxiety around it is unbelieveable. It haunts me. It makes me feel so self concious and worthless. which in turn is ridiculous but it's how I feel. Im not the most good looking, but im certainly not the worst. And my personality sure as shit isn't the worst. but yet people 'worse' in both aspects are getting it gone. But anyway.\n\nAfter this became more potent I started drinking more, not as much to even question the word 'problem' However since then I have jumped from booze to drugs. frequently getting high on Weed and Codiene. I tried cocaine too. That was awful. \n\nI have spiralled further from my self, getting high at home on my own, not being able to get out of bed, barely picking up the guitar, hardly talking at all and then the other day I was sat at the end of my bed. looking at my medication (im on 9 pills a day so I have over 100 pills in my room. from anti depressants, anti anxiety, Folic acid tablets and sleeping tablets) and I was about 3 seconds away from grabbing whatever I could and doing it right. forth times the charm right? that's the saying??\n\nAll people have said the past year is 'Wow Raven, on the bright side. you didnt die, and this was a year of survival' which sure that's true but I dont care. that doesnt help me in anyway or make me feel better ahahah.\n\nI dont know why Im posting this.\n\nIf you read all this, fair play ahah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove,\n\nRaven xx", "author_fullname": "t2_2mw2k1e9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I feel so alone. lol", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_el045w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578372712.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;for the past 2 and a half years I have been downwardly spiralling. heading into the abyss in my head. delving deeper and deeper into darkness.

Things changed a little bit when I started to visit the local college, but in. the end only the bullying stopped and I still lived as a loner with my parents.\n\n3 years ago I moved out and lived in a new city for my master’s degree...and what can I say, I had the best time of my life. I met amazing people and went out to clubs and parties for the first time in my life.

I've had depression since I was a child but it got worse and I became suicidal after my great grandmother died when I was 17. I tried living on my own about 3 or so years ago. I got fired from my job and did nothing until I hit the bottom and ended up homeless living in a shed for over a year. I could have gone on welfare but just did nothing. I would take my bike at night and grab bags of garbage from restaurant dumpsters for food. I was in the shed throughout a winter. One day my aunt came out of nowhere and took me in. We had never really known each other.\n\nI had somehow lost my Id, social insurance card, bank account, birth certificate and started to slowly get things back together. I ended up getting a job at a carwash. It's a very easy job. I have severe anxiety and constantly worried I was going to get fired. But really anyone could do this job. \n\nMy depression got very severe after a year. My severe social anxiety almost disappeared because I no longer gave a crap about anything. When I would get stressed or depressed, I would feel like I was having a nervous breakdown. I started to repeatedly tell myself I'm a terrible person and constantly insulted myself. It felt like my mind had just cracked. \n\nOne day my boss said hi to me and I couldn't even pretend to smile. He has a son with severe mental issues and immediately saw that I wasn't doing well. He helped me get a private doctor for free even without a health card or Id. I was put on antidepressants. \n\nI've had a lot of issues with my aunt and her boyfriend. A few days after I was saved from being in homelessness, her boyfriend threw a mask at me and told me about a place he wanted to rob. Nothing happened with that. He slowly revealed himself as a racist bully who lacked empathy and could manipulate people in a massive way. He was arrested multiple times, cops walked through the house looking for a gun, etc.. but I was never allowed to have a problem with any of this or my aunt would threaten to send me back into homelessness. I was always the bad guy in every situation involving her boyfriend. And I think it destroyed my self esteem. I started bullying myself and I think it really damaged my mind.\n\nAnyway, my boss is in a program that helps people with mental issues, so he has been able to give me incredible advice. I ended up in the hospital for suicidal thoughts. I was afraid something was going to happen and I called my boss crying. He contacted the doctor and the doctor recommended I go.to the emergency room. I was put on 2 different antidepressants. I didnt notice a single difference for a few months. \n\nBut slowly I've noticed moments of pure happiness for no real reason at all. There is a way to get out of most depressed feelings, every suicidal thought I've ever had was not logical. And my boss seems to be an expert in helping me with that. \n\nMy plan is to save up and get an apartment for myself. I'm going to get a social worker who can help me get my id. And maybe I'll be put in a group home so I dont end up where I was.\n\nI'm not sure where to go with this, but i wanted people to know about my boss who helped me so much when he barely knew me. Hes a great man and there does seem to be an answer to these horrible thoughts we get. Some lives are much worse than others, but it seems a lot of these thoughts really dont have logic at the end of the day. The problem is that these thoughts sometimes happen regardless if its logical. I'm still suicidal, but it's more so intrusive thoughts when I get into a really bad place, I don't constantly believe it's the best option. I'm also religious and I dont  believe suicide will help me at all.\n\nI've been put on celexa and risperdal which is an antipsychotic, but I was told it would help boost the antidepressants and help me sleep. I've taken 4 sleeping aids at one time and nothing ever works. I even tried drinking wine to help me sleep. It definitely worked but only 10 sips gave me bizarre nightmares for almost a week and it really lowers my body temperature for some reason. \n\nLately I've been in a much better mood for some reason. Hopefully it lasts. Honestly I feel a bit guilty for even feeling this good in a place like this...\n\nI hope this is helpful in some way.", "author_fullname": "t2_2qo3stqj", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My boss saved my life", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ekzgpf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1578341663.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578370018.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im 24 years old.

This starts in october and ends in february every year. I'm finally getting help because it started affecting my performance at work. I've tried light therapy, more vitamin D, taking an extra half hour break (compensated by staying half an hour longer) so I can take walks outside, sleep hygiene is on point, you name it I've tried it. It didn't help enough, so I sought help. My therapy sessions are starting next week and I have a few questions.\n\nI'm going in to cognitive behavioral therapy. How has this helped you cope with your depression? I have read about it and I have one friend who has had good outcomes with this type of therapy, but I've lost contact with him recently (possibly also because of my depression and my oversharing, and it's the main focus of my negative thoughts lately) and he won't answer my questions. Probably because he's learned not to feed other people's depressions or his own but I can't be sure because he's not answering.\n\nI'm considering taking a vacation to a sunny place next winter. Has any of you tried this? Does it help? I'm worried about a possible comedown once I get back home and back to the relative darkness.\n\nOn to the most complicated thing in this post...\n\nMy friend is in a mentally challenging situation himself. He has PTSD from a near-death experience in his pre-teens. He's had brain surgery at 23 (when we had a relationship) which has left him with brain damage, which leaves him with emotional difficulties and depression. He's been in therapy for his PTSD, and is learning how to live with his brain damage. We weren't in a relationship together for 6 years when we reconnected in 2018 and evolved into a fwb relationship. I fell in love with him again after being with him regularly for 10 months. He has told me he cares about me a lot and he loved me. I've honestly never felt this much love between myself and someone else.\n\nThen this winter came, along with my winter depression. I shared all my feelings with him. He didn't respond for a while, and when he finally did respond he told me he was having a PTSD relapse and was isolating himself because of it. This tore me up and when we finally got the opportunity to talk about it, he broke up the fwb relationship. He promised me we would stay in contact and remain friends, but the benefits would be out for now. I told him about my worries, how I'd lose yet another friend and be alone forever (I haven't had a lot of friends my whole life and feel like I don't have anyone left to call 'friend'), how I'd slip back into a deep depression, and as I listed everything I was worried about he reassured me he wouldn't let that happen.\n\nI've had problems maintaining friendships all my life. I try to keep in touch, but eventually the friendship just stops existing. I've thought about why a lot. The only reason I can come up with is that I'm the limiting factor myself. The situation with my friend only strenghtens that idea. I've been sharing too many of my thoughts and feelings and now he won't talk to me anymore. I'm causing him to isolate himself, I'm sure of it. He's terribly afraid of confrontation, maybe that's the reason why he's not telling me what he's thinking/feeling. It's all maybe's and what-ifs. Nothing is confirmed so I'm unsure of what to do. I haven't contacted him since december 31st, but I broke yesterday and sent another barrage of texts his way... I shouldn't have done that. My texts focussed on his promises to me and how he hasn't kept them.\n\nNow, on to my questions regarding this. How do I snap out of it? I can't be sure of his reasoning behind his not answering my calls/texts. I can't go visit him out of the blue because that would be creepy. Right? I don't know what he's doing, I don't know if he even has time for a visit, I don't know what he thinks of me or my behaviour. And yes, that is important to me because I can't lose another friend because of my mental crapfest.\n\nI feel like this is way too long of a post already. Another reason why I think people stop contacting me.

This starts in october and ends in february every year. I&amp;#39;m finally getting help because it started affecting my performance at work. I&amp;#39;ve tried light therapy, more vitamin D, taking an extra half hour break (compensated by staying half an hour longer) so I can take walks outside, sleep hygiene is on point, you name it I&amp;#39;ve tried it. It didn&amp;#39;t help enough, so I sought help. My therapy sessions are starting next week and I have a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going in to cognitive behavioral therapy. How has this helped you cope with your depression? I have read about it and I have one friend who has had good outcomes with this type of therapy, but I&amp;#39;ve lost contact with him recently (possibly also because of my depression and my oversharing, and it&amp;#39;s the main focus of my negative thoughts lately) and he won&amp;#39;t answer my questions. Probably because he&amp;#39;s learned not to feed other people&amp;#39;s depressions or his own but I can&amp;#39;t be sure because he&amp;#39;s not answering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering taking a vacation to a sunny place next winter. Has any of you tried this? Does it help? I&amp;#39;m worried about a possible comedown once I get back home and back to the relative darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to the most complicated thing in this post...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend is in a mentally challenging situation himself. He has PTSD from a near-death experience in his pre-teens. He&amp;#39;s had brain surgery at 23 (when we had a relationship) which has left him with brain damage, which leaves him with emotional difficulties and depression. He&amp;#39;s been in therapy for his PTSD, and is learning how to live with his brain damage. We weren&amp;#39;t in a relationship together for 6 years when we reconnected in 2018 and evolved into a fwb relationship. I fell in love with him again after being with him regularly for 10 months. He has told me he cares about me a lot and he loved me. I&amp;#39;ve honestly never felt this much love between myself and someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then this winter came, along with my winter depression. I shared all my feelings with him. He didn&amp;#39;t respond for a while, and when he finally did respond he told me he was having a PTSD relapse and was isolating himself because of it. This tore me up and when we finally got the opportunity to talk about it, he broke up the fwb relationship. He promised me we would stay in contact and remain friends, but the benefits would be out for now. I told him about my worries, how I&amp;#39;d lose yet another friend and be alone forever (I haven&amp;#39;t had a lot of friends my whole life and feel like I don&amp;#39;t have anyone left to call &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39;), how I&amp;#39;d slip back into a deep depression, and as I listed everything I was worried about he reassured me he wouldn&amp;#39;t let that happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had problems maintaining friendships all my life.

I feel that I am capable of finding somebody, but I feel that I am too shy and awkward to even have somebody be interested in me.

But I guess I start from the top.\n\nWhen i was in school from grade 1 all the way up to grade 9 i was heavily bullied and I was not a person that said enough is enough and hit back\n\nInstead I held it all inside me, Clinching my teeth and crying at night when no one heard me. I got stoned thrown at me, Beaten up, Hunted around school so I hid in stairwells, robbed and my things broken, Usually my cloth were all ripped up when i got home from being held down on the ground.\n\nMy mom back then had split up with her other half and being a single mom in the early 80,s was a big thing and it took a lot of energy from her so watching how she every day worked her ass off for me I didn't dare to say that I wasn't in school for weeks because I got beaten up and bullied every single day and going through a process of changing school and going to meetings and all that I feared would take a to big hit on my mom so instead I kept my mouth shut.\n\nYears moved on and I completed the 1-9 grade school and went into the gymnasium. By then I had 0 friends from my older school, I had heavy depression (that I did not talk about to anyone) but always kept on smiling because in my head I felt that if I just smile. I will feel better. It became a mask I put on every morning when I woke up.          I never finished the gymasium because of my depression that gave it open hunting season for everyone that loved to be mean to people that did not fit in to the \"alpha\" status in the class pushed me to be put in a \"special\" class that just did everything worse so i quit after 1 year saying fuck it all.\n\nI met some ppl in the gymnasium and through the years we became friends. My depression started to slowly fade away but every time I was alone I could feel it coming creeping up, There for I always made sure to have a party or people at my place. And I am talking always, Monday to Sunday we had party at my house, There were always people over and there were always people calling on my door wanting to come in.\n\nThanks to being so many parties and having so many people around me every day i got the feeling that I belonged but I was completely blind from what other people from the outside looking in started to see. That was that they were using me for a place where they just could party and stay instead of being at home. They were not my friends, They were people that wanted to be with me because I let them party and go crazy. But still I was blind to that. I kept on smiling and gladly opening my door for anyone that wanted to come in to my house because I didn't want to be alone.\n\nAfter a couple of years with heavy drinking and partying every day a whole summer and usually the winter month it happened, I got thrown out and everything got pulled out under my feet. I moved up to the country side in a house where I lived and every day a guy came by checking up on me that I didn't do anything stupid like partying or drugs.\n\nWell that worked out for maybe half a summer before I learned to know a new bunch of people up there and it all started again. Partying a whole summer with drugs and alcohol. It was also here I for the first time heard: You have it to easy to say YES to people. I didn't listen and when the winter came and the time to get back to the city took hours and the small community where I lived started to get more and more isolated the bad thoughts started to come again and it ended with me cutting up my arms with a knife. That next summer people that worked in the house started to realize what I did so they instantly found me a place back in the big city to stop me from self harm.\n\nI moved back in the end of the summer and it didn't take long before I started to not be able to say \"NO\" to people and my new apartment was filled with people, fights, drinking, drugs and partying. Long story short.. 2 years later I lived in an other place, Nothing had changed more then the street and the address but the person I was, Was still the same. Had a hard time saying NO because I felt that if I do people will get pissed off and I will get lonely so I just let it slip.\n\nMore partying, More drinking, More Drugs. Though now people around me really have started to realize that hey maybe this guy is way to nice? He maybe can't say no? Yet they continued with questions like: Can I come by with some friends when I was alone at home. And of course, Me being a person with heavy depression and started at this point get suicidal thoughts did of course not say no. All kind of different people came by partying, Some ppl I did not know at all and some people came with 5 other people and I did not say anything because I was starting to get to mentally tired of all the drugs and drinking.\n\nBut slowly I started to feel like enough is enough so a moment came where I said NO! Enough is enough.\n\nAnd that ended with that it was me that everyone turned on with questions like: Why are you so mean? What's wrong with you? What have we done you? Why are you acting up like that? And when I told them I have a depression, A big one they said. Well talk to US about it then, As I did and cried my eyes out. They listened and were supportive but even if I for a moment felt good, It didn't take long before I as soon as I was alone at home started to battle against me questioning my self: What if.... I just jump from a bridge?\n\nSome years moved on and I was walking around like an empty shell, I was still going to parties, I was still out clubbing sometimes and I was still having home parties but something had changed. Instead of being that always happy person walking around talking to everything and everyone I now more sat on a chair in the back of the room just watching people, Reading people and starting to see connection. If someone asked me if everything was alright with me sitting all alone I said that everything was just great, I just needed to rest.\n\nA lot of the people from all the home parties by now I did not meet anymore. They did not call me or ask how I was and when I called them I usually got no answer or I got an answer about a huge party somewhere that I was invited to if I wanted but I started to feel more and more that if I go there I will just sit alone in a corner and observe people.\n\nSlowly everything started to change, People didn't call me anymore because I no longer partied every weekend, I was no longer the fun and always happy dude but started to become a easily annoyed person, An easily triggered person and a person that had no what so ever problem with drugs.\n\nTime passed by and my circle of maybe 20 ppl went down to 6, Then to 5 then to 4. By this time I had come to an acceptance that \"older\" people don't have a lot of friends, Less so 20 people they party with every weekend so I did not care about it. But there was still a lot of: Did you know what he/she said or have you heard what He/she done and for me that was the last thing I needed to hear, I did not want drama and i had by this time heavy anxiety of stuff i knowed i had done making it incredibly hard to sleep at night, I did not care for it so I started to push away from that also. Sadly that meant that the 4 people became just 2 and with that my anxiety also leveled up thinking people leaving me because i have done something wrong.\n\nThen I met a beautiful woman, Older then me with some years but I felt that this woman was the one that I had been waiting for a big time of my life, We clicked on every level and she listened to my story (that I now tell you) and she said strait up: Stop hanging out with these people, Everyone of them. They have all connection to who you were, Not who you want to become and sometimes you have to let people go, Even if they are really really close to your heart.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and I did, Together with her. I realized that even if I loved my friends from the deepest bottom of my heart sometimes it had to end there. With them in my heart, Nothing more. It started to work, I did not focus on drama or get anxiety over who would call me on my phone, Asking what I was doing and wondering why I hadn't called or anything or why I haven't partied anything more or if I could get my hands on stuff.\n\nSo, Month passed and we got incredibly tight. She made me smile from the bottom of my heart in a way that I never had done before, She made me laugh for real and she made me feel so incredibly good being next to her. She told me that even if its hard I need to focus on my self and I have to be strong. I have to be a person that focus on positive energy and focus forward.\n\nTime moved on and as all couples do we fought, I started a new job that went great and everything seemed to be clearing up. Until one evening when she and I just were home drinking and chilling and we got in a fight over a person that had feelings for her and it went so far with her being real drunk showed me a couple of SMS,es (that I now in hindsight think she realized the day after was NOT a good idea) because clearly he had been writing her for weeks, Saying how he missed there time in the sofa cuddling and so on where she clearly had been writing him back not saying that it might be a very fucking stupid idea to write that when I have a boyfriend but instead she wrote hearts and kisses back. Seeing that put me in a downward twist with her thinking that if she did not even tell me that before we had a fight, What more is she not telling me and me being a person where honesty and respect is A and O in a relationship really started to loose my grip.\n\nSo I went and bought some weed to calm my nerves and try to focus, Sadly that made me slowly get more and more silent and turned inwards, It made me more \"low\" emotionally and I was more tired of everything. So she defending her self broke up with me leaving me with no friends, no communication with anyone, No social life and isolated.\n\nNow of course you can just pull yourself up in the back and say enough is fucking enough and start over again but I feel so tired now, Its all like a dark pit that I slowly just glide down towards and I can't find anything to hold on to. I am NOT writing this to feel sad about my self, I am NOT writing this to get pity from anyone else. I am writing this because I Dona know how long I can take this and just wanted to get it all out there.\n\nNow I am alone, isolated, don't talk to anyone more then my mom sometimes and if I did not go out during the days I would not talk to anyone for weeks maybe month. I have no energy left it feels like, I am all cold inside and I feel so tired and i dont know how long i can continue this to tell the truth before i am putting a gun in my mouth and blowing my head out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry the very long read.", "author_fullname": "t2_mrplr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "[Very long read] What happened...

But I guess I start from the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i was in school from grade 1 all the way up to grade 9 i was heavily bullied and I was not a person that said enough is enough and hit back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I held it all inside me, Clinching my teeth and crying at night when no one heard me. I got stoned thrown at me, Beaten up, Hunted around school so I hid in stairwells, robbed and my things broken, Usually my cloth were all ripped up when i got home from being held down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom back then had split up with her other half and being a single mom in the early 80,s was a big thing and it took a lot of energy from her so watching how she every day worked her ass off for me I didn&amp;#39;t dare to say that I wasn&amp;#39;t in school for weeks because I got beaten up and bullied every single day and going through a process of changing school and going to meetings and all that I feared would take a to big hit on my mom so instead I kept my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years moved on and I completed the 1-9 grade school and went into the gymnasium. By then I had 0 friends from my older school, I had heavy depression (that I did not talk about to anyone) but always kept on smiling because in my head I felt that if I just smile. I will feel better. It became a mask I put on every morning when I woke up.          I never finished the gymasium because of my depression that gave it open hunting season for everyone that loved to be mean to people that did not fit in to the &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; status in the class pushed me to be put in a &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; class that just did everything worse so i quit after 1 year saying fuck it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met some ppl in the gymnasium and through the years we became friends. My depression started to slowly fade away but every time I was alone I could feel it coming creeping up, There for I always made sure to have a party or people at my place. And I am talking always, Monday to Sunday we had party at my house, There were always people over and there were always people calling on my door wanting to come in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to being so many parties and having so many people around me every day i got the feeling that I belonged but I was completely blind from what other people from the outside looking in started to see. That was that they were using me for a place where they just could party and stay instead of being at home. They were not my friends, They were people that wanted to be with me because I let them party and go crazy. But still I was blind to that. I kept on smiling and gladly opening my door for anyone that wanted to come in to my house because I didn&amp;#39;t want to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years with heavy drinking and partying every day a whole summer and usually the winter month it happened, I got thrown out and everything got pulled out under my feet. I moved up to the country side in a house where I lived and every day a guy came by checking up on me that I didn&amp;#39;t do anything stupid like partying or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well that worked out for maybe half a summer before I learned to know a new bunch of people up there and it all started again. Partying a whole summer with drugs and alcohol. It was also here I for the first time heard: You have it to easy to say YES to people. I didn&amp;#39;t listen and when the winter came and the time to get back to the city took hours and the small community where I lived started to get more and more isolated the bad thoughts started to come again and it ended with me cutting up my arms with a knife. That next summer people that worked in the house started to realize what I did so they instantly found me a place back in the big city to stop me from self harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved back in the end of the summer and it didn&amp;#39;t take long before I started to not be able to say &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; to people and my new apartment was filled with people, fights, drinking, drugs and partying. Long story short.. 2 years later I lived in an other place, Nothing had changed more then the street and the address but the person I was, Was still the same. Had a hard time saying NO because I felt that if I do people will get pissed off and I will get lonely so I just let it slip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More partying, More drinking, More Drugs. Though now people around me really have started to realize that hey maybe this guy is way to nice? He maybe can&amp;#39;t say no? Yet they continued with questions like: Can I come by with some friends when I was alone at home. And of course, Me being a person with heavy depression and started at this point get suicidal thoughts did of course not say no. All kind of different people came by partying, Some ppl I did not know at all and some people came with 5 other people and I did not say anything because I was starting to get to mentally tired of all the drugs and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But slowly I started to feel like enough is enough so a moment came where I said NO! Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that ended with that it was me that everyone turned on with questions like: Why are you so mean? What&amp;#39;s wrong with you? What have we done you? Why are you acting up like that? And when I told them I have a depression, A big one they said. Well talk to US about it then, As I did and cried my eyes out. They listened and were supportive but even if I for a moment felt good, It didn&amp;#39;t take long before I as soon as I was alone at home started to battle against me questioning my self: What if.... I just jump from a bridge?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some years moved on and I was walking around like an empty shell, I was still going to parties, I was still out clubbing sometimes and I was still having home parties but something had changed. Instead of being that always happy person walking around talking to everything and everyone I now more sat on a chair in the back of the room just watching people, Reading people and starting to see connection. If someone asked me if everything was alright with me sitting all alone I said that everything was just great, I just needed to rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the people from all the home parties by now I did not meet anymore. They did not call me or ask how I was and when I called them I usually got no answer or I got an answer about a huge party somewhere that I was invited to if I wanted but I started to feel more and more that if I go there I will just sit alone in a corner and observe people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly everything started to change, People didn&amp;#39;t call me anymore because I no longer partied every weekend, I was no longer the fun and always happy dude but started to become a easily annoyed person, An easily triggered person and a person that had no what so ever problem with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time passed by and my circle of maybe 20 ppl went down to 6, Then to 5 then to 4. By this time I had come to an acceptance that &amp;quot;older&amp;quot; people don&amp;#39;t have a lot of friends, Less so 20 people they party with every weekend so I did not care about it.

coast of the US, and have been dealing with mild depression for my entire adult life. I'm married , and my wife puts up with my bs, now that she's learned better ways to deal with it. At least when I let it show.\n\nAnyway, I finally talked to my doctor about it, he called it mild depression, and prescribed me lexapro. That was about 2 1/3 years ago. \n\nI have a fear of two things, spiders, and death (including ghosts, they give me the jibblies). The second one has kept me from ever trying to kill myself. \n\nIt's never stopped me from feeling absolutely worthless, however, like nothing I do really matters to anyone, or like any time I try to succeed, I'll just come out worse. \n\nUgh, I'm wordy. Anyway, I finally got a steady job that I can one day retire from, am an active part of my local union, and have held onto a 5 year old youtube channel that I try to stay excited about.\n\nOh, and I'm trying to raise my credit score to get a house so we can get out of a shitty apartment.\n\nTl:dr my intro: I'm just a guy who tries to do good things so he can feel better about himself. Also I take pills.\n\nCurrently:\n\nIt got me again. The pills kept me from seeing the pit of depression, I see it as a pit in a dry, flat land. But I misstepped, and fell in. It's never one single thing, it never has been, it's just that any one thing had the ability to send me there.\n\nAnyway, I was really good at cleaning up my credit, but the loan company told me I needed to do a few more, to me, impossible tasks. My paychecks are already stretched to their limits, Xmas was coming, and I was working overtime with high stress levels.\n\nThat was two things.\n\nThe big reason we're trying to get out is because our landlord told us our kitten had to go. She was the only thing that was able to pull my wife out of her misery when our eldest cat died, in early summmer.\n\nThat kitten is staying with a friend of ours, and my wife goes there to spend time with her when our friend goes out of town to visit her bf, which is about every other weekend.\n\nWe talked about it, and it was supposed to be for the 3 months it took to clean up my credit. It's month 5 now. I know if she doesn't spend time with the kitten, the kitten may not recognize her as she does now, while I have logic and would not forget her.\n\nThat's a third thing.\n\nThe promotion I was hoping for (with a raise that would make it so I don't stretch my paycheck ALL the way) showed up, but it was done in a way wherein I couldn't apply for it.\n\nAs this is the third time I tried and failed at it, now I need to look at rethinking my entire career plan. That's not their rule, but what's the point, y'know?\n\nThing number 4.\n\nThere are more: An almost always there headache that started when I got some tooth work done 6 months ago,  an inability to get that taken care of as my insurance was finished. I also owe them money because they were halfway through a procedure series when my insurance did run out.\n\nAn argument that ruined my visiting for the weekend cat stay after xmas, and [political figure] made the worst mistake in my lifetime, and I'm worried about that.\n\nAnd yet, I didn't realize I was in the pit of depression until a couple of people at work asked me about it. It must be all over my face.\n\nTl/dr: things happened that made me depressed again, and I just realized I'm that way because other people told me.", "author_fullname": "t2_rb8rq", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Introduction of me, return of the void", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ekyrmw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578367179.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little about me to introduce myself, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 38, from the east coast of the US, and have been dealing with mild depression for my entire adult life.

That was about 2 1/3 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a fear of two things, spiders, and death (including ghosts, they give me the jibblies). The second one has kept me from ever trying to kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never stopped me from feeling absolutely worthless, however, like nothing I do really matters to anyone, or like any time I try to succeed, I&amp;#39;ll just come out worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I&amp;#39;m wordy. Anyway, I finally got a steady job that I can one day retire from, am an active part of my local union, and have held onto a 5 year old youtube channel that I try to stay excited about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I&amp;#39;m trying to raise my credit score to get a house so we can get out of a shitty apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl:dr my intro: I&amp;#39;m just a guy who tries to do good things so he can feel better about himself. Also I take pills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It got me again. The pills kept me from seeing the pit of depression, I see it as a pit in a dry, flat land. But I misstepped, and fell in. It&amp;#39;s never one single thing, it never has been, it&amp;#39;s just that any one thing had the ability to send me there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was really good at cleaning up my credit, but the loan company told me I needed to do a few more, to me, impossible tasks. My paychecks are already stretched to their limits, Xmas was coming, and I was working overtime with high stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was two things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big reason we&amp;#39;re trying to get out is because our landlord told us our kitten had to go. She was the only thing that was able to pull my wife out of her misery when our eldest cat died, in early summmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kitten is staying with a friend of ours, and my wife goes there to spend time with her when our friend goes out of town to visit her bf, which is about every other weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talked about it, and it was supposed to be for the 3 months it took to clean up my credit. It&amp;#39;s month 5 now. I know if she doesn&amp;#39;t spend time with the kitten, the kitten may not recognize her as she does now, while I have logic and would not forget her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The promotion I was hoping for (with a raise that would make it so I don&amp;#39;t stretch my paycheck ALL the way) showed up, but it was done in a way wherein I couldn&amp;#39;t apply for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this is the third time I tried and failed at it, now I need to look at rethinking my entire career plan. That&amp;#39;s not their rule, but what&amp;#39;s the point, y&amp;#39;know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thing number 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are more: An almost always there headache that started when I got some tooth work done 6 months ago,  an inability to get that taken care of as my insurance was finished. I also owe them money because they were halfway through a procedure series when my insurance did run out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An argument that ruined my visiting for the weekend cat stay after xmas, and [political figure] made the worst mistake in my lifetime, and I&amp;#39;m worried about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, I didn&amp;#39;t realize I was in the pit of depression until a couple of people at work asked me about it. It must be all over my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl/dr: things happened that made me depressed again, and I just realized I&amp;#39;m that way because other people told me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekyrmw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MystXtreme", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekyrmw/introduction_of_me_return_of_the_void/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekyrmw/introduction_of_me_return_of_the_void/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578338379.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Back when I was younger (in my teens, I'm an \"adult\" now) I used to play this weird game called \"Gaiaonline\" and it was pretty forum based with a few flash games here.

I’ve never been diagnosed or even seen a doctor/therapist for this so maybe I don’t deserve to be posting here? But I just feel so low and exhausted. I feel like everything in my life is crashing around me and I can’t claw my way out of this awful despair.\n\nMy husband and I have been married for six years but it’s never been easy. We fight all the time over stupid stuff, but mostly because of the way he reacts/over reacts to even small stressors. If he needs to make breakfast but the pan is dirty, it turns into a diatribe about how he always does everything and the kitchen is never clean and he’s going to be late for work because he’s not dressed yet and he needs to clean the whole kitchen before he can wash a pan to cook eggs (and when I say, ”just wash the pan don’t clean the whole kitchen” I’m met with more yelling that I “don’t get it”). \n\nIf our kid is being loud or annoying him or isn’t listening it turns into him yelling at her and then yelling at me for asking him to calm down and then it’s “she does this because of you, she doesn’t respect me because you keep doing this in front of her, she doesn’t listen to me because you keep bossing me around.” \n\nEven small disagreements between the two of us are met with sarcasm and hurtful words and I’m so exhausted from it. This happens almost daily and I’m so, so exhausted from constantly being yelled at, and yelling back. I’ve spent so long fighting with him, trying to explain how what he does makes me feel, demanding better treatment and suggesting counseling (he won’t go because his mom forced him to do counseling when he was younger and he knows they’ll just take my side. Or, he says he’ll go but I won’t like it because the therapist will tell me all the ways I’m causing problems in our relationship and I’ll finally see that it isn’t all his fault so he doesn’t think I really want to go 🙄). \n\nAnd I’m just tired to the point that I don’t even try anymore. I don’t argue with him, I don’t fight, but still he yells and argues with me. He has whole arguments between the two of us with himself where he tells me exactly how he thinks I’ll react to something, what I’ll say, how I’ll feel, while I sit and watch. And I’m just so tired from it. I feel like I’m carrying all of his stress and my own because he can’t manage his stress and anxiety in a healthy way.\n\nAnd on top of that I run my own business and it is not going well. I set goals every year and I never reach them, I struggle so hard to bring in customers and every year I start off hopeful but I watch other businesses succeeding when I just can’t seem to make it happen. I work so hard to hustle but it feels like I’m taking one step forward and two steps back. And everyone makes it seem so easy. “Just do xyz and you’ll make 6 figures, buy this course and you’ll uplevel your business in no time, etc. etc.” But I’m doing all the things and it’s not working and I’m so tired of trying. Everyone says “your website is amazing, your work is so good, you’re so talented” and yet I can’t get people to actually buy anything from me?? I’m so tired of being told no over and over and over again. I’m tired of seeing people who don’t know what they’re doing or who have half the experience I do succeed while I can’t. I’m tired of fighting so hard and being rejected over and over again. I don’t know how to keep putting in effort and not seeing results. And it’s like, what can I do? Just give up? Close my business? Fail? How will I pay my bills? I don’t even know what I’d do with my life if I didn’t run this business. \n\nAnd all of this stress has just come crashing down on me all at once and I feel so broken. Our house is a mess, I haven’t showered or brushed my teeth or combed my hair since Thursday, I’m sitting in filthy clothes but I’m so tired I can’t do anything about it. All I can do is lay in bed and cry all day. And when I’m not crying I just feel numb. And none of this is new. I’ve had periods like this before and I just chalked it up to being lazy. But this is different. I feel so low. I can’t bring myself to do anything. All I want to do is lay in bed. Not even watching tv is helping. Normally I can take a day or two, or a week, binge watch some tv and then I can get back to life after a while. This time I just feel so low and can’t seem to recover. I’ll feel better for an hour and then I’m reminded about how shitty my life is and I’m crawling back into bed for the fourth time that day.\n\nAnd my husband, as much as we fight, still seems to want to help me? But I can’t talk to him about all this because how can I say, again, “you’re the one who is causing my unhappiness. Your stress is too much for me. The yelling is too much. The lack of kindness and compassion is unbearable. At least that’s how I feel.” But that conversation always leads to talks about counseling or divorce and you can guess how that ends up. With him angry and yelling and me crying and just wanting to be in bed for the rest of forever. Been there, done that a thousand times. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I’m so tired and I feel like I’m failing at life. Sometimes I feel like maybe our good days are good enough to stick it out. Maybe we can try harder and make it work? A lot more often I feel like I want to divorce, but I have no way of supporting myself and my child. The thought of making enough money with my business to support the two of us just feels impossible. But then how do I work a minimum wage job and pay for childcare and pay our bills?? I don’t know what to do but I’m so tired of trying and putting in so much effort into everything just to see things fall to shit again. I feel trapped. Stuck in this deep hole and I can’t do anything to get out of it so why bother fighting anymore. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you and I’m sorry, I don’t even know why I’m posting this other than I have no one to turn to and maybe some strangers on the internet can relate? I’m just tired of pretending that I’m happy and everything is good and okay. I’m tired of pretending I have this great happy relationship full of love and a great successful business that’s doing so well. No one knows how it really is. Not even my closest friends or family.

However, just a heads up that this is going to be long. A lot has happened in the past year or so and it is really hard to summarize without leaving out key details. I'm just looking for any advice from others, especially those who have suffered from depression while in a relationship and can help give me some perspective. Just a note that I am currently working with an online therapist and have my first in-person therapy appointment scheduled for tomorrow. \n\n  \nMy boyfriend is 22, I am 23. We have been dating for 15 months. We met through my ex-boyfriend a couple of years before we started dating. My ex was a narcissist who put me through a lot of narcissistic and emotional abuse, as well as sexually assaulting me on several occasions. My current boyfriend ended up becoming his best friend. I dated my ex for almost 5 years. During the last parts of my relationship with my ex, my boyfriend and I started growing closer to each other. My ex wanted to open the relationship and actively encouraged us to see each other. It was then that I realized how messed up my situation with my ex was and I broke up with him. I was living with him, so my current boyfriend offered his place up to me to stay when I didn't feel safe in my own apartment. We started \"seeing each other\" as this was happening. It was a messy situation. I had freshly gone through trauma and had experienced trauma throughout my childhood. I was a mess. My boyfriend was going through some depression issues at the time, but he kept them hidden (as many people with depression do). He seemed to cope with this by smoking weed a lot. He frequently joked about how he should cut back, and that I should never feel the need to smoke as much as he does because it's probably too much for anyone. He would occasionally mention very quickly that he had a rough day and spent time crying in bed listening to sad music. Just little things here and there. I had never really been close to a guy with depression before, so I never really knew how to help (and am now realizing sometimes there's just not much I can do). So I would cuddle him and hug him and just let him know I was there. \n\n  \nThings were pretty good in the beginning, besides my anxiety attacks and his off days. He started saying I was one of the only good things to happen to him during college. I spent most nights at his place, both because I enjoyed staying there and also because I didn't feel very safe in my apartment. As time went on, things started getting even better. We realized we liked each other for more than just sex/company, and that we really enjoyed talking with each other and doing things together. We had extremely similar goals in life (both wanted to move to the same state out west, both wanted to eventually build a van and travel, both wanted to get involved in the music industry, etc.) and it felt really good to have someone understand those things. \n\n  \nHowever, I had occasional setbacks. I had 22 years of unprocessed trauma just sitting in my brain and body. I had one failed attempt at therapy in high school, and that experience caused me to hate what my idea of therapy was. I thought it was super professional and clinical, and didn't realize that there are therapists out there who offer more calming/casual safe spaces where I could still work through a lot of my issues. I also didn't really realize how severe my issues were, thanks to my parents and ex-boyfriend (all of whom had caused a large portion of my trauma) frequently minimized my mental health issues. They told me they weren't real or that I was just trying to play the victim. That there were easy fixes to help me. So I just kind of did what a lot of people with trauma/C PTSD do, I turned myself into a workaholic. I made myself so busy so that none of my emotions would catch up with me. I ran from my trauma, desperately, even though I didn't fully realize it was there at all. I worked 60+ hour weeks, which was something I could not mentally or physically handle at the time. I distracted myself in every way I possibly could. Which was unhealthy. I bottled up all of my emotions/traumas until I would occasionally snap. One of the first times that this happened was over a weekend where my boyfriend's college was having a one-day music festival. It's a big party weekend for the school. His high school friends from out of state were coming to stay the weekend. They got an Airbnb together so the three of them could stay somewhere. My boyfriend had miscommunicated that I was more than welcome to hang out with them all weekend, but that apparently wasn't what he meant. He ended up wanting a lot of alone time with them, which is fine with me, I just thought I had been told something different. The day before the festival I had one of the first big moments where I \"snapped\". I couldn't get ahold of my boyfriend and started spiraling. I can't even remember what had set me off in the first place or what thought loop I got stuck in, but I ended up considering walking in front of a car that night. I eventually got in my car and drove near my boyfriend's house. I parked the car and called him a bunch of times, unable to get an answer from him. He eventually picked up the phone saying that he was sorry, his phone had been on silent. I explained what had happened and he flipped. He asked where I was and wanted me to stay there. He \"came to the rescue\" and scooped me up, making sure I was okay. The next day was the music festival. We took acid, which was a horrible idea for him to even offer it to me, and also a horrible idea of mine to take it. I had taken it a few times before but was obviously not in a mental state to be dealing with that. After the music festival itself was over, we went back to his place to hang out. Eventually, his friends wanted to head back to the Airbnb. For whatever reason, I had it in my head from the miscommunication about the weekend that I would be going back with them, but I was wrong. I was supposed to stay at his place. I was still tripping and had been fending off anxiety the entire trip. I broke down. I cried and said I couldn't believe he was making me stay there by myself while I was still in that state. He became frustrated. He eventually left and came back the next day, wanting to break up with me. He said he loved me so much but that things were unhealthy for him. We talked for a while and decided to keep the relationship going, on the condition that I start therapy. I found an online therapist that same day. We talked about doing couples counseling, but that never happened. \n\n  \nThis ended up happening a few times. I snapped, started having suicidal thoughts, and he came to the rescue thinking he could save the day, except, this wasn't his job. It was a job for a professional. He convinced himself that he could save me from PTSD flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. He put a ton of pressure on himself to be the perfect boyfriend and ended up enabling some bad behaviors of mine that were caused by my own mental health issues. My online therapist was of no help to me whatsoever. She made me understand that I had PTSD and severe anxiety, but never gave me the tools to actually help me work through them. She enabled me further, saying my boyfriend was my knight in shining armor who had come to rescue me. She focused more on what he could do for me than what I could do for myself. It was a fucked situation. I believed this therapist was supposed to help me, so I believed what she said. I worked on an off with her for months. She got me a Xanax prescription for panic attacks, which helped immensely in the moment, but due to the fact that I am a 23-year-old my doctor gave me an incredibly low dose prescription and it was hard to get a refill. All of this was causing my trauma issues to just get bottled up further. My therapist wasn't giving me the tools I needed. My boyfriend wasn't giving me the space I needed to work through my traumas by myself, because he just wanted to fix me and my problems. I felt lost, but I didn't know why at the time. \n\n  \nMy anxiety and depression only got worse. I was fired from a new job I loved because the owner blew through all of her investment money and couldn't pay her two employees anymore. I was working part-time. I had been saving to get my own apartment because I thought having my own space would be healthier for our relationship since it was really hard to spend any time at all in my apartment with my abusive ex. I was determined to find an apartment, but then lost this job and barely had an income. I was only making $100/week from a part-time nannying job. I thought we were supposed to move in a couple of months, so my boyfriend offered for me to just stay with him and then we would move out west together. He was about to graduate from college/start his job search. That job search didn't work out and caused him a lot of pain. He felt defeated. I felt awful for him but also was now stuck in a situation where I didn't know what the fuck to do. I could tell things were getting tense in our relationship, but our plans had just completely changed and I needed to now find a job in the area/change my plans. He enrolled in a data science boot camp so that he could make his resume a little better/get some more skills in his field. I tried my best to be optimistic about the situation. I suggested we both find our own short-term sublets in the area so we could just stay the duration of his boot camp and then move. He thought this was great and the search began. It didn't pan out. We both couldn't find something that was good for us to be alone, so we eventually found a large two-bedroom apartment in the area that was available for the exact duration we needed to stay. It was a relief. Except for that right when we were supposed to move in, the girl told us she had given it to her rental company instead because she was \"too busy\" to do the paperwork and forgot to contact us. We ended up scrambling for Airbnbs. \n\n  \nFrom September to December 2019 we stayed in multiple Airbnbs. I was working two stressful nannying jobs from 5:30 am-9:30 am and then 3 pm-6 pm (one of which I quit on the spot in late November because the mom was a nightmare, wasn't paying me the correct hours, frequently changed my schedule a few hours beforehand, made me stay later without notice, and was treating me horribly). On top of that, I was doing an online Digital Marketing certificate. I was burning out fast, and my traumas/mental issues were quickly catching up to me. My boyfriend was \"working\" long 9 am-6 pm days at his boot camp, with a 40+ minute train commute. It was a huge change for him, as he spent the summer in his room most of the day job searching. He was exhausted too. We were both starting to struggle. All this time we were bouncing around from place to place, living out of suitcases, trying so hard to make the situation work. Staying in small rooms together, while bringing my two cats with us. During the month of September, we didn't stay in the same Airbnb for more than 4 days. There were weekends where we didn't have an Airbnb to stay in so we drove a few hours to go camping after dropping off my cats at a friend's apartment. At first, it was sort of fun, but in reality, it was hell. We tried to make the best of it. We tried so hard to be there for each other, but we were both spiraling into deep mental health issues. My boyfriend was slipping into depression. At first, it was hard to notice, but looking back now I can see all of the signs so clearly, and I'm kicking myself for not noticing sooner. He was starting to become distant. He would get overwhelmed easy. He wanted to go to concerts less, which was one of our favorite things to do together. He was tired. All this time though, he was still trying to be the \"perfect\" boyfriend and help me during my rough days. Except at this point, it wasn't helping. It was hurting me. It wasn't allowing me to go through my mental issues on my own. It was making me feel crazy. \n\n  \nWe were supposed to both go to Thanksgiving in his hometown in California. It would be my first time traveling to his home state and seeing his parents' house. I was so excited, as my daily life had started to feel like an inescapable hell. It felt like he dangled that trip in front of me, using it to encourage me to get through shitty days of work. Then the news came that his childhood dog would probably be euthanized over Thanksgiving break, while he and his brother were home. He knew it had been coming for months, but it hit him hard. I hugged him and tried to be there for him, but he started being incredibly distant. He didn't want to talk about it and started slowly but surely pushing me away. Right before Thanksgiving, he dropped a lot of stuff on me. It was the night I had quit my nannying job spot, working for a narcissistic/abusive mom boss who had been driving me insane for months. I came home crying and was upset, especially after the dad boss had sent me some nasty texts saying I had \"caused chaos for a beautiful family and that I should be ashamed of myself\". Then, my boyfriend dropped on me that he had called his mom (I believe for the first time in a couple of weeks because he was starting to sneakily push everyone away), and a lot of our circumstances were changing. I wasn't going with him to California for Thanksgiving, meaning I was to stay in the Airbnb alone for the holiday (my car had just recently broken down and wouldn't make the trip to my family's home out of state). He didn't have a job yet and said it may take months longer than he had originally thought to get one. His parents had offered to help him pay for the Airbnb (I was paying half, his parents were paying the other half), up until mid-December, and then he was to move home to job search. Leaving me to move home to my parents' house, where so much childhood trauma had happened to me. I snapped. I sat on the bed crying for hours. I said I was going to leave the Airbnb and never come back, hinting at suicide. I told my boyfriend I never wanted to see him again. I had just completely lost it. I wasn't able to deal with all of these life changes at once while I was holding years of trauma, anxiety, and sadness. On top of that, I was being sent back to the one place I never really wanted to stay in again. \n\nHe froze. He just sat there. He went into his avoidant-attachment shell. He also cried. The next few days he was just a shell of himself. He felt awful for what he had put me through and was starting to have the realization that his communication issues were causing major issues in the relationship. He said he completely understood if I wanted to break up with him and that I deserved better than him. I assured him that I was upset, but that we could work through this. That I thought he was worth just trying to work through everything. He said he was going to go home to California for 7-10 days and start seeing a therapist while he was there. That he would come back to visit me before our stay at the Airbnb was up and before I finished up my morning nannying job and moved to my parents' home. He wanted to fix things. He wanted to get better at communication so we would stop having these fights and he would stop promising things and then backing out on them last minute. He left for California and I proceeded to have a rough few days. We talked every day while he was gone, but I fear that as he was falling into a depressive episode that I was not fully aware of, that my anxiety about the situation was pushing him further and further away. That it was making him feel more guilty to hear how shaken up I was after my entire world had just collapsed around me after he told me the change in plans. I spent a lot of days just crying. Grieving the plan I had been dangling in front of myself to get through those last few months of living in a city that made me miserable. It got me through months of working jobs that made me feel I had no purpose. Then, it was gone. My boyfriend was falling deeper and deeper into his depression, but I was too anxious/panicked/sad/shocked/stuck to even really notice. I feel fucking horrible about it now. He kept extending his stay in California, saying he needed more time alone/more time in therapy. \n\nThe uncertainty about the future was eating me alive. I started having trouble sleeping, eating, and drinking water. About 2 weeks after he had gone home to California, I had the worst mental breakdown of my life, all while on a video call with my boyfriend. I had just told my morning nannying family that I was quitting, which had been incredibly stressful for me (due to me hating being a burden on other people). I was video chatting with my boyfriend and joked about having a drink. He said \"Why not? You don't have work today and deserve to celebrate.\" The issue was that he didn't know I had been sleeping MAYBE 3 hours a night for days. I hadn't eaten food in 48 hours. I was barely drinking water. I was mostly just downing caffeine. I opened a drink. It made me feel better. I continued to have maybe 3 or 4 throughout the call. That's when the breakdown happened. At the beginning of the call, I was super optimistic about everything going on and was saying it would all work out and I wanted to be patient, but the alcohol triggered some deep emotions within me. I proceeded to blackout and apparently tell my boyfriend I was going to kill myself. It was the first time I had ever explicitly said I was going to kill myself, instead of just hinting at it. He called the National Suicide Hotline. They told him to get in contact with my friends in the area and vaguely told the Airbnb host to keep an eye on me because I was struggling with my mental health. While this was going on, I apparently left the room and self-harmed for the first time in over 10 years. I sent my boyfriend a picture of my arm, telling him that this was what was happening because I had to move home, and hung up the discord call. He freaked out and called my closest friends in the area, explaining the situation. The National Suicide Hotline told him they didn't think I was in immediate danger, but to have friends check up on me. I ended up passing out on my bed with my winter jacket on, keys beside me. I woke up a few hours later to the discovery that this had happened, and looked back on the chat with my boyfriend. I panicked. I didn't know what the fuck was going on with my brain. I tried calling him multiple times but couldn't reach him. I ended up contacting the friends that had reached out to me and talked to them, they helped calm me down. \n\nMy boyfriend and I eventually talked after a couple of days of him not talking to me. He sent me an incredibly long message and asked if he could read it to me over the phone. He often time has issues communicating his feelings via talking, so I know that writing things down can help him a lot. It went into detail about how he had enabled me and was hurting me in the process. How he didn't have what it takes to help me solve my mental health issues. That he could do what he could to be a good boyfriend and hold my hand through the process of me getting help, but that he couldn't take responsibility for my anxiety and depression anymore. He said we needed a calm and collected space to voice our opinions about how we feel about each other without getting aggressive or escalating the situation (which we both are at fault for). We are in that anxious-avoidant dance where when conflict happens, he shuts down and I panic and feel the need to vocalize all of my fears/worries/anger. Which causes us to get stuck in this cycle where we aren't coming to a resolution. He said he hasn't wanted to see me upset/hurt so he oftentimes doesn't speak up and bottles his feelings up inside. He said he was scared that if he told me his opinions that it would seem like he was foisting all responsibilities of the issues of our relationship onto me. He said the attempts he has made to solve my \"snap\" situations have just been bandages and stopgaps instead of actual solutions and has become evident to him that it has just been hurting me even more. He put all of this pressure on himself to get me out of my rut, but that he was setting himself up for failure because he doesn't have what it takes to help me as a professional would. He said it isn't either of our responsibilities to \"fix\" each other's anxiety and depression (we both suffer from both, I tend to lean more towards anxiety and he leans more towards depression). He said he loves hearing my voice on the phone and talking to me but that it is hard for him to maintain keeping up with my anxious moments through the phone.\n\nHe ended up saying \"Ultimately it is our responsibility to ourselves and to each other to develop good independent coping mechanisms so that we can allow each other to lead the lives that we want to so that we can support each other in those endeavors and enjoy the journey in the process. I will openly admit that I do not currently have those-- my most frequently used is to do nothing and lock up. I feel like working this through is going to require a hefty amount of therapy on both of our parts, as they are the professionals who have the tools and the know-how to help us develop those independent coping skills and healthy mental states. \" He promised me in this letter that he loved me and really does want to continue dating me. He said he wants us to have happy healthy lives together but as independent individuals who can support each other and thrive together. \n\nI did not initially have a great response to this letter, as it was a lot to take in. This was my first time hearing him fully open up like this and it was a lot to handle at once, while I was already not in a great mental state. Over the next week or so, I had severe panic attacks every single day. Unfortunately, my boyfriend heard a few of them over the phone while he was calling to check in on me. So it seemed to him like nothing was changing, while in reality, I was just having a hard time processing what I had read a few days earlier. A week before I was supposed to leave the Airbnb, he stopped talking to me. One night he messaged me a super sweet goodnight message after I was asleep, saying that he loved me but was sorry he didn't call that night. He had a really dysphoric therapy session that evening, but that he loved me and would talk to me the next day. That never happened. I spent the entire weekend freaking out about what I had done wrong. I messaged him simple, nice things trying to let him know I was sorry if I had done something wrong. \n\nEventually, I took some time to just process what I had read. I stopped messaging him and really sat with my feelings about everything. I wrote another really long letter back explaining that we were on the same page now and that it just took me longer than expected to process everything. That I was willing to go to in-person therapy, look into meds, look into couples counseling, and try to fix things, not only for us but for me. I sent him a short message a few days before I had to leave the Airbnb, explaining the progress I had made (getting a prescription from the doctor, getting a new temporary online therapist, explaining why my last one had been awful, spending time with friends, etc.) and letting him know that I was sorry he was struggling. I let him know that I understand if he needs space and that I would love to read him the letter I wrote when he was ready. He responded a few days later, the night before I was supposed to move back to my parents' house, saying that he loved me and was ready to talk. That he would call tomorrow. \n\nThat call the next day after moving home to my parents' place was amazing. It was over 2 hours long. It was emotional but made me feel really optimistic. It was my first time talking to him in a week. He explained to me that he had fallen into a depressive episode. He felt awful about not coming back to the Airbnb before I was leaving and that he didn't know how to tell me. He had planned on coming back but ended up being offered a job through his dad's company so he could get something on his resume. Unfortunately, the meetings he had to go to ended up being really close to when I was going to leave, so flying back didn't make sense. He said he shut down and dissociated for days, just staring at a wall, and focusing on his job search when he could. He felt so guilty about everything he had done to me. I assured him it was okay and that it was hard for me, but I forgave him. I read him my letter. He broke down crying and said I had hit the nail on the head throughout the entire thing. About how he was feeling, about what I needed to do to get better, and about our dream for a beautiful future together. He initially broke down crying when I read the part about his depression, and how I suspected it made him feel like he didn't deserve me. How he shut down in the relationship every time his communication issues hurt me. How he would ruminate about losing the love of his life due to his mistakes/struggles. I told him he deserved the relationship. That I loved him. That I was done putting timelines on him to fix the whole mess. That I wanted to be patient with him, and be here to support him. That I was done trying to \"fix\" him. That I was just doing that because I hated seeing him in pain and wanted to rip that pain away from him, but realized I couldn't. That he just needed time in California to rest and heal. That what he needed right now is love, support, and time, and that I wanted to give him those things. He cried and said he needed to hear this and that he was so happy that we were on the same page. He wanted a future with me but that it would take time. He said he loved me. He gave me so many reasons to feel optimistic about everything. He said he felt a weight fall from his shoulders. He said he was going to hang out with high school friends that night (the same ones that didn't have a great impression of me from the music festival). I told him I was so excited for him to hangout with them and hoped he would have fun. We made plans to have a movie night online the next day. He told me he was going to contact our mutual friend that he had also been shutting out and planned to call him the next day. We said we loved each other and goodbye, and he told me we would talk soon. \n\nIt's been over two weeks. Our mutual friend (who is, by the way, one of his very best friends) still has not heard from him and was never messaged/called like my boyfriend told me he would. There could be so many reasons he isn't talking to me right now, and I'm just sort of lost. I had a rough time the first couple of days because he promised me he would talk (like has happened before over the last couple of months) and then just disappeared. On top of that, two days after I got home/the phone call happened, my parents and I got into a fight where they both started emotional abusing me a little bit again. I started having a flashback during this. I eventually got myself out of the room with them and went up to my room, falling onto my bed sobbing. I, out of habit, messaged my boyfriend briefly explaining that my worst fears had come true and that my parents were being awful to me again. An hour later I realized that was a mistake and I was crossing a boundary that had never really been set, but that I knew was too much for him currently. I sent him a message saying I was sorry and I still was working on handling these situations without him/had slipped up. That I understood it was a lot to handle and I was sorry I had messaged him. I messaged a few days later on Christmas saying I would call later to wish him a Merry Christmas. That message went through. A few hours later after waking up with a fever/the flu, I called him but his phone was turned off. I messaged him saying I was sorry I didn't call earlier because I had the flu, and that message never went through. His phone was completely shut off. I cried. I have pretty much cried most days since then. I have held off from trying to message him. I see him come online on Facebook every couple of days, just for a few minutes. He hasn't \"read\" any of my messages, but I know you can read received messages with airplane mode on. \n\nIt is January 6th today. I haven't tried to contact him since Christmas. It hurts. It hurts a lot, but I know he is struggling. I wish I could just wrap him up in a hug, but I am across the country and can't. I have focused on finishing my Digital Marketing certificate (which should be done within the next few days) so I can get a couple of smaller certifications, and begin my job search for a remote job. I have been reading articles on depression, especially male depression, to try and understand what he is going through. I have read articles on how to anxious-avoidant relationships can be healed.  I know his therapist specifically focuses on attachment theory and does a lot of couples therapy to show couples how to properly communicate with each other to save their relationships. I have done a lot of self-work in the past couple of weeks. I have been meditating every day, getting time outside, learning better coping strategies from my current online therapist. I am hoping that my session with my new in-person therapist goes well tomorrow, as she specializes in trauma and works with EMDR and DBT. I haven't started my SSRIs yet (I was prescribed generic Lexapro), as I didn't want them to affect me getting this certification done in time, but plan on starting to take them next week. I talked to a mutual friend of my boyfriend and I's last night, and she said I sound like a drastically different person to who I was a few weeks ago. She said she is proud of me for working so hard. I have been having dreams where I try to reach my boyfriend on the phone, but can't because the people who have traumatized me are getting in the way of me contacting him. I realize I need to work on my traumas before I can continue a healthy relationship with him. I realize these things now but am scared. Logically, I know that I have so many reasons to trust that he eventually wants to work things out, but that he is just majorly struggling right now. He told me multiple times that he loves me, but just doesn't have the tools currently to offer what I need, but that he is working on getting them. That it will take time. I understand this, but my anxiety is eating away at me, telling me he wants to break up with me. Convincing me that he never wants to talk to me again/hasn't contacted me because he is scared to break up with me. It's gotten to the point where the last couple of days it has been hard for me to get out of bed. I feel like I'm taking on a couple of symptoms of depression. I have to peel myself away from working at my laptop just to go curl up in bed and sob. I'm learning to self-soothe because I was neglected as a child. It's hard, but I'm trying my best. \n\nI guess I just need some perspective from the other side since my boyfriend obviously is having a hard time communicating right now. I have a hunch he feels guilty that he isn't contacting me. That he is worried that when he eventually contacts me, I'm going to be mad at him for ghosting me and just break up with him. I know he has said he doesn't want to feel like a burden to me (something we both struggle with feeling). Do I send him a short message just letting him know I'm still here? I have been contemplating for the past few days just sending him something along the lines of \"Hey, I don't expect an answer to this message, but I just want you to know that you are loved. I love you and I am sending hugs. I'm here if you ever need me.\" However, I keep getting hung up on if this will push him away or if he will appreciate this. I don't know if it will annoy him and he just actually wants space? Or if he is feeling scared of abandonment and would like to know I'm still here for him. On top of all of this, I have no clue what is happening with his dog. They didn't euthanize him over Thanksgiving and I guess were planning to do it around the holidays while his brother was home. My boyfriend has had this dog since he was 11, he is 22 now. That's half of his life. It's devastating for him, and I feel horrible. Before he left for Thanksgiving I asked him to give me a heads up for when they decided to put his dog down, because I wanted to send him a letter to read to his dog from me. I know that my boyfriend was extremely torn up about me never getting to meet his dog. He cried when I suggested the letter and said he would really appreciate this a lot, and said it would be really special. So I'm half wondering if something happened with his dog and he feels guilty telling me/is just even more depressed because his childhood dog is gone? I could definitely see him feeling guilty about me never getting to meet the dog because he wanted me to so badly. \n\nI guess I'm just a little lost, trying to make up stories in my mind of what is going on to keep myself sane. I know I won't know the truth until he decides to talk to me. We have our stuff together, near our old apartment in another state, in a storage unit. I have his DJ controller (which is a prized possession of his) because he left it at the Airbnb, intending to get it when he came back to get it. It's not like we are never going to talk again, and it really does seem to me (despite what my anxiety tries to tell me) that he wants this to work out. I guess I just want to be as supportive as possible but am struggling with how to do that without hurting him more. I feel guilty as hell for my own actions throughout the relationship. He means the world to me. I never got that excited about having a future with anyone (even after dating my ex for almost 5 years I would roll my eyes if he ever brought up marriage or some further commitment), but I can see a future with my boyfriend. Our dreams are so weirdly similar. I know this post has been a highlight real of our bad moments (specifically mine because I don't feel that I am in a place to start blaming him for the things his depression has caused him to do), but when we are both having good mental health days this relationship is a dream. We are happy with each other. He expresses to me that he loves me more than he has ever loved anyone. That most of his favorite memories include me. We push each other to follow our dreams, to be better people, to be happy, but our unresolved mental health issues have caused us both to get SO scared of losing this relationship, that we have both fucked up. He pushes me away by distancing himself from me. I push him away by self-sabotaging both myself and the relationship. I want a future with him. I want this to work out, even if it takes a lot of time. I understand that his depression may never \"go away\", and just want to learn how to support him and be there for him when those hard times come. I know my anxiety is making me be impatient as hell, which is why I'm directing my worries to Reddit and therapy both today and tomorrow (and of course weekly in the future). How can I support this person I love so fucking much after I unintentionally pushed him away because of my own unresolved traumas? How can I support this person who is terrified of losing me, so he isolates himself so he doesn't do anything to hurt me? \n\nIf you made it this far. Thank you. This took me a long time to write and scrolling back I realize how long it is. I hate that so much has happened in such a short time in this relationship. I kind of want to propose (once he is ready) that we \"start over\" in a sense. I want to live in my own apartment for a year (once we decide to move to the state we want to move to) so I am not overwhelming him when I have bad days, and so I can learn to support myself through my bad moments. So I can reparent the inner child within me that has been lost for years, that is causing me issues now. I expressed to him in our phone call a couple of weeks ago that I want to get \"me\" back after having my identity ripped away from me in my previous abusive relationship. I want to develop hobbies that I'm not trying to monetize. I want to get some friends outside of our mutual friend group so I can have nights out without my boyfriend/our mutual friends. So I can develop a life of my own, so I can have the ability to have a healthy commitment with my boyfriend.

However, just a heads up that this is going to be long. A lot has happened in the past year or so and it is really hard to summarize without leaving out key details. I&amp;#39;m just looking for any advice from others, especially those who have suffered from depression while in a relationship and can help give me some perspective. Just a note that I am currently working with an online therapist and have my first in-person therapy appointment scheduled for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend is 22, I am 23. We have been dating for 15 months. We met through my ex-boyfriend a couple of years before we started dating. My ex was a narcissist who put me through a lot of narcissistic and emotional abuse, as well as sexually assaulting me on several occasions. My current boyfriend ended up becoming his best friend. I dated my ex for almost 5 years. During the last parts of my relationship with my ex, my boyfriend and I started growing closer to each other. My ex wanted to open the relationship and actively encouraged us to see each other. It was then that I realized how messed up my situation with my ex was and I broke up with him. I was living with him, so my current boyfriend offered his place up to me to stay when I didn&amp;#39;t feel safe in my own apartment. We started &amp;quot;seeing each other&amp;quot; as this was happening. It was a messy situation. I had freshly gone through trauma and had experienced trauma throughout my childhood. I was a mess. My boyfriend was going through some depression issues at the time, but he kept them hidden (as many people with depression do). He seemed to cope with this by smoking weed a lot. He frequently joked about how he should cut back, and that I should never feel the need to smoke as much as he does because it&amp;#39;s probably too much for anyone. He would occasionally mention very quickly that he had a rough day and spent time crying in bed listening to sad music. Just little things here and there. I had never really been close to a guy with depression before, so I never really knew how to help (and am now realizing sometimes there&amp;#39;s just not much I can do). So I would cuddle him and hug him and just let him know I was there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things were pretty good in the beginning, besides my anxiety attacks and his off days. He started saying I was one of the only good things to happen to him during college. I spent most nights at his place, both because I enjoyed staying there and also because I didn&amp;#39;t feel very safe in my apartment. As time went on, things started getting even better. We realized we liked each other for more than just sex/company, and that we really enjoyed talking with each other and doing things together. We had extremely similar goals in life (both wanted to move to the same state out west, both wanted to eventually build a van and travel, both wanted to get involved in the music industry, etc.) and it felt really good to have someone understand those things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I had occasional setbacks. I had 22 years of unprocessed trauma just sitting in my brain and body. I had one failed attempt at therapy in high school, and that experience caused me to hate what my idea of therapy was. I thought it was super professional and clinical, and didn&amp;#39;t realize that there are therapists out there who offer more calming/casual safe spaces where I could still work through a lot of my issues. I also didn&amp;#39;t really realize how severe my issues were, thanks to my parents and ex-boyfriend (all of whom had caused a large portion of my trauma) frequently minimized my mental health issues. They told me they weren&amp;#39;t real or that I was just trying to play the victim. That there were easy fixes to help me. So I just kind of did what a lot of people with trauma/C PTSD do, I turned myself into a workaholic. I made myself so busy so that none of my emotions would catch up with me. I ran from my trauma, desperately, even though I didn&amp;#39;t fully realize it was there at all. I worked 60+ hour weeks, which was something I could not mentally or physically handle at the time. I distracted myself in every way I possibly could. Which was unhealthy. I bottled up all of my emotions/traumas until I would occasionally snap. One of the first times that this happened was over a weekend where my boyfriend&amp;#39;s college was having a one-day music festival. It&amp;#39;s a big party weekend for the school. His high school friends from out of state were coming to stay the weekend. They got an Airbnb together so the three of them could stay somewhere. My boyfriend had miscommunicated that I was more than welcome to hang out with them all weekend, but that apparently wasn&amp;#39;t what he meant. He ended up wanting a lot of alone time with them, which is fine with me, I just thought I had been told something different. The day before the festival I had one of the first big moments where I &amp;quot;snapped&amp;quot;. I couldn&amp;#39;t get ahold of my boyfriend and started spiraling. I can&amp;#39;t even remember what had set me off in the first place or what thought loop I got stuck in, but I ended up considering walking in front of a car that night. I eventually got in my car and drove near my boyfriend&amp;#39;s house. I parked the car and called him a bunch of times, unable to get an answer from him. He eventually picked up the phone saying that he was sorry, his phone had been on silent. I explained what had happened and he flipped. He asked where I was and wanted me to stay there. He &amp;quot;came to the rescue&amp;quot; and scooped me up, making sure I was okay. The next day was the music festival. We took acid, which was a horrible idea for him to even offer it to me, and also a horrible idea of mine to take it. I had taken it a few times before but was obviously not in a mental state to be dealing with that. After the music festival itself was over, we went back to his place to hang out. Eventually, his friends wanted to head back to the Airbnb. For whatever reason, I had it in my head from the miscommunication about the weekend that I would be going back with them, but I was wrong. I was supposed to stay at his place. I was still tripping and had been fending off anxiety the entire trip. I broke down. I cried and said I couldn&amp;#39;t believe he was making me stay there by myself while I was still in that state. He became frustrated. He eventually left and came back the next day, wanting to break up with me. He said he loved me so much but that things were unhealthy for him. We talked for a while and decided to keep the relationship going, on the condition that I start therapy. I found an online therapist that same day. We talked about doing couples counseling, but that never happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This ended up happening a few times. I snapped, started having suicidal thoughts, and he came to the rescue thinking he could save the day, except, this wasn&amp;#39;t his job. It was a job for a professional. He convinced himself that he could save me from PTSD flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. He put a ton of pressure on himself to be the perfect boyfriend and ended up enabling some bad behaviors of mine that were caused by my own mental health issues. My online therapist was of no help to me whatsoever. She made me understand that I had PTSD and severe anxiety, but never gave me the tools to actually help me work through them. She enabled me further, saying my boyfriend was my knight in shining armor who had come to rescue me. She focused more on what he could do for me than what I could do for myself. It was a fucked situation. I believed this therapist was supposed to help me, so I believed what she said. I worked on an off with her for months. She got me a Xanax prescription for panic attacks, which helped immensely in the moment, but due to the fact that I am a 23-year-old my doctor gave me an incredibly low dose prescription and it was hard to get a refill. All of this was causing my trauma issues to just get bottled up further. My therapist wasn&amp;#39;t giving me the tools I needed. My boyfriend wasn&amp;#39;t giving me the space I needed to work through my traumas by myself, because he just wanted to fix me and my problems. I felt lost, but I didn&amp;#39;t know why at the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My anxiety and depression only got worse. I was fired from a new job I loved because the owner blew through all of her investment money and couldn&amp;#39;t pay her two employees anymore. I was working part-time. I had been saving to get my own apartment because I thought having my own space would be healthier for our relationship since it was really hard to spend any time at all in my apartment with my abusive ex. I was determined to find an apartment, but then lost this job and barely had an income. I was only making $100/week from a part-time nannying job. I thought we were supposed to move in a couple of months, so my boyfriend offered for me to just stay with him and then we would move out west together. He was about to graduate from college/start his job search. That job search didn&amp;#39;t work out and caused him a lot of pain. He felt defeated. I felt awful for him but also was now stuck in a situation where I didn&amp;#39;t know what the fuck to do. I could tell things were getting tense in our relationship, but our plans had just completely changed and I needed to now find a job in the area/change my plans. He enrolled in a data science boot camp so that he could make his resume a little better/get some more skills in his field. I tried my best to be optimistic about the situation. I suggested we both find our own short-term sublets in the area so we could just stay the duration of his boot camp and then move. He thought this was great and the search began. It didn&amp;#39;t pan out. We both couldn&amp;#39;t find something that was good for us to be alone, so we eventually found a large two-bedroom apartment in the area that was available for the exact duration we needed to stay. It was a relief. Except for that right when we were supposed to move in, the girl told us she had given it to her rental company instead because she was &amp;quot;too busy&amp;quot; to do the paperwork and forgot to contact us. We ended up scrambling for Airbnbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From September to December 2019 we stayed in multiple Airbnbs. I was working two stressful nannying jobs from 5:30 am-9:30 am and then 3 pm-6 pm (one of which I quit on the spot in late November because the mom was a nightmare, wasn&amp;#39;t paying me the correct hours, frequently changed my schedule a few hours beforehand, made me stay later without notice, and was treating me horribly). On top of that, I was doing an online Digital Marketing certificate. I was burning out fast, and my traumas/mental issues were quickly catching up to me. My boyfriend was &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; long 9 am-6 pm days at his boot camp, with a 40+ minute train commute. It was a huge change for him, as he spent the summer in his room most of the day job searching. He was exhausted too. We were both starting to struggle. All this time we were bouncing around from place to place, living out of suitcases, trying so hard to make the situation work. Staying in small rooms together, while bringing my two cats with us. During the month of September, we didn&amp;#39;t stay in the same Airbnb for more than 4 days. There were weekends where we didn&amp;#39;t have an Airbnb to stay in so we drove a few hours to go camping after dropping off my cats at a friend&amp;#39;s apartment. At first, it was sort of fun, but in reality, it was hell. We tried to make the best of it. We tried so hard to be there for each other, but we were both spiraling into deep mental health issues. My boyfriend was slipping into depression. At first, it was hard to notice, but looking back now I can see all of the signs so clearly, and I&amp;#39;m kicking myself for not noticing sooner. He was starting to become distant. He would get overwhelmed easy. He wanted to go to concerts less, which was one of our favorite things to do together. He was tired. All this time though, he was still trying to be the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; boyfriend and help me during my rough days. Except at this point, it wasn&amp;#39;t helping. It was hurting me. It wasn&amp;#39;t allowing me to go through my mental issues on my own. It was making me feel crazy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to both go to Thanksgiving in his hometown in California. It would be my first time traveling to his home state and seeing his parents&amp;#39; house. I was so excited, as my daily life had started to feel like an inescapable hell. It felt like he dangled that trip in front of me, using it to encourage me to get through shitty days of work. Then the news came that his childhood dog would probably be euthanized over Thanksgiving break, while he and his brother were home. He knew it had been coming for months, but it hit him hard. I hugged him and tried to be there for him, but he started being incredibly distant. He didn&amp;#39;t want to talk about it and started slowly but surely pushing me away. Right before Thanksgiving, he dropped a lot of stuff on me. It was the night I had quit my nannying job spot, working for a narcissistic/abusive mom boss who had been driving me insane for months. I came home crying and was upset, especially after the dad boss had sent me some nasty texts saying I had &amp;quot;caused chaos for a beautiful family and that I should be ashamed of myself&amp;quot;. Then, my boyfriend dropped on me that he had called his mom (I believe for the first time in a couple of weeks because he was starting to sneakily push everyone away), and a lot of our circumstances were changing. I wasn&amp;#39;t going with him to California for Thanksgiving, meaning I was to stay in the Airbnb alone for the holiday (my car had just recently broken down and wouldn&amp;#39;t make the trip to my family&amp;#39;s home out of state). He didn&amp;#39;t have a job yet and said it may take months longer than he had originally thought to get one. His parents had offered to help him pay for the Airbnb (I was paying half, his parents were paying the other half), up until mid-December, and then he was to move home to job search. Leaving me to move home to my parents&amp;#39; house, where so much childhood trauma had happened to me. I snapped. I sat on the bed crying for hours. I said I was going to leave the Airbnb and never come back, hinting at suicide. I told my boyfriend I never wanted to see him again. I had just completely lost it. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to deal with all of these life changes at once while I was holding years of trauma, anxiety, and sadness. On top of that, I was being sent back to the one place I never really wanted to stay in again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He froze. He just sat there. He went into his avoidant-attachment shell. He also cried. The next few days he was just a shell of himself. He felt awful for what he had put me through and was starting to have the realization that his communication issues were causing major issues in the relationship. He said he completely understood if I wanted to break up with him and that I deserved better than him. I assured him that I was upset, but that we could work through this. That I thought he was worth just trying to work through everything. He said he was going to go home to California for 7-10 days and start seeing a therapist while he was there. That he would come back to visit me before our stay at the Airbnb was up and before I finished up my morning nannying job and moved to my parents&amp;#39; home. He wanted to fix things. He wanted to get better at communication so we would stop having these fights and he would stop promising things and then backing out on them last minute. He left for California and I proceeded to have a rough few days. We talked every day while he was gone, but I fear that as he was falling into a depressive episode that I was not fully aware of, that my anxiety about the situation was pushing him further and further away. That it was making him feel more guilty to hear how shaken up I was after my entire world had just collapsed around me after he told me the change in plans. I spent a lot of days just crying. Grieving the plan I had been dangling in front of myself to get through those last few months of living in a city that made me miserable. It got me through months of working jobs that made me feel I had no purpose. Then, it was gone. My boyfriend was falling deeper and deeper into his depression, but I was too anxious/panicked/sad/shocked/stuck to even really notice. I feel fucking horrible about it now. He kept extending his stay in California, saying he needed more time alone/more time in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty about the future was eating me alive. I started having trouble sleeping, eating, and drinking water. About 2 weeks after he had gone home to California, I had the worst mental breakdown of my life, all while on a video call with my boyfriend. I had just told my morning nannying family that I was quitting, which had been incredibly stressful for me (due to me hating being a burden on other people). I was video chatting with my boyfriend and joked about having a drink. He said &amp;quot;Why not? You don&amp;#39;t have work today and deserve to celebrate.&amp;quot; The issue was that he didn&amp;#39;t know I had been sleeping MAYBE 3 hours a night for days. I hadn&amp;#39;t eaten food in 48 hours. I was barely drinking water. I was mostly just downing caffeine. I opened a drink. It made me feel better. I continued to have maybe 3 or 4 throughout the call. That&amp;#39;s when the breakdown happened. At the beginning of the call, I was super optimistic about everything going on and was saying it would all work out and I wanted to be patient, but the alcohol triggered some deep emotions within me. I proceeded to blackout and apparently tell my boyfriend I was going to kill myself. It was the first time I had ever explicitly said I was going to kill myself, instead of just hinting at it. He called the National Suicide Hotline. They told him to get in contact with my friends in the area and vaguely told the Airbnb host to keep an eye on me because I was struggling with my mental health. While this was going on, I apparently left the room and self-harmed for the first time in over 10 years. I sent my boyfriend a picture of my arm, telling him that this was what was happening because I had to move home, and hung up the discord call. He freaked out and called my closest friends in the area, explaining the situation. The National Suicide Hotline told him they didn&amp;#39;t think I was in immediate danger, but to have friends check up on me. I ended up passing out on my bed with my winter jacket on, keys beside me. I woke up a few hours later to the discovery that this had happened, and looked back on the chat with my boyfriend. I panicked. I didn&amp;#39;t know what the fuck was going on with my brain. I tried calling him multiple times but couldn&amp;#39;t reach him. I ended up contacting the friends that had reached out to me and talked to them, they helped calm me down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I eventually talked after a couple of days of him not talking to me. He sent me an incredibly long message and asked if he could read it to me over the phone. He often time has issues communicating his feelings via talking, so I know that writing things down can help him a lot. It went into detail about how he had enabled me and was hurting me in the process. How he didn&amp;#39;t have what it takes to help me solve my mental health issues. That he could do what he could to be a good boyfriend and hold my hand through the process of me getting help, but that he couldn&amp;#39;t take responsibility for my anxiety and depression anymore. He said we needed a calm and collected space to voice our opinions about how we feel about each other without getting aggressive or escalating the situation (which we both are at fault for). We are in that anxious-avoidant dance where when conflict happens, he shuts down and I panic and feel the need to vocalize all of my fears/worries/anger. Which causes us to get stuck in this cycle where we aren&amp;#39;t coming to a resolution. He said he hasn&amp;#39;t wanted to see me upset/hurt so he oftentimes doesn&amp;#39;t speak up and bottles his feelings up inside. He said he was scared that if he told me his opinions that it would seem like he was foisting all responsibilities of the issues of our relationship onto me. He said the attempts he has made to solve my &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot; situations have just been bandages and stopgaps instead of actual solutions and has become evident to him that it has just been hurting me even more. He put all of this pressure on himself to get me out of my rut, but that he was setting himself up for failure because he doesn&amp;#39;t have what it takes to help me as a professional would. He said it isn&amp;#39;t either of our responsibilities to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; each other&amp;#39;s anxiety and depression (we both suffer from both, I tend to lean more towards anxiety and he leans more towards depression). He said he loves hearing my voice on the phone and talking to me but that it is hard for him to maintain keeping up with my anxious moments through the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ended up saying &amp;quot;Ultimately it is our responsibility to ourselves and to each other to develop good independent coping mechanisms so that we can allow each other to lead the lives that we want to so that we can support each other in those endeavors and enjoy the journey in the process. I will openly admit that I do not currently have those-- my most frequently used is to do nothing and lock up. I feel like working this through is going to require a hefty amount of therapy on both of our parts, as they are the professionals who have the tools and the know-how to help us develop those independent coping skills and healthy mental states. &amp;quot; He promised me in this letter that he loved me and really does want to continue dating me. He said he wants us to have happy healthy lives together but as independent individuals who can support each other and thrive together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not initially have a great response to this letter, as it was a lot to take in. This was my first time hearing him fully open up like this and it was a lot to handle at once, while I was already not in a great mental state. Over the next week or so, I had severe panic attacks every single day. Unfortunately, my boyfriend heard a few of them over the phone while he was calling to check in on me. So it seemed to him like nothing was changing, while in reality, I was just having a hard time processing what I had read a few days earlier. A week before I was supposed to leave the Airbnb, he stopped talking to me. One night he messaged me a super sweet goodnight message after I was asleep, saying that he loved me but was sorry he didn&amp;#39;t call that night. He had a really dysphoric therapy session that evening, but that he loved me and would talk to me the next day. That never happened. I spent the entire weekend freaking out about what I had done wrong. I messaged him simple, nice things trying to let him know I was sorry if I had done something wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I took some time to just process what I had read. I stopped messaging him and really sat with my feelings about everything. I wrote another really long letter back explaining that we were on the same page now and that it just took me longer than expected to process everything. That I was willing to go to in-person therapy, look into meds, look into couples counseling, and try to fix things, not only for us but for me. I sent him a short message a few days before I had to leave the Airbnb, explaining the progress I had made (getting a prescription from the doctor, getting a new temporary online therapist, explaining why my last one had been awful, spending time with friends, etc.) and letting him know that I was sorry he was struggling. I let him know that I understand if he needs space and that I would love to read him the letter I wrote when he was ready. He responded a few days later, the night before I was supposed to move back to my parents&amp;#39; house, saying that he loved me and was ready to talk. That he would call tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That call the next day after moving home to my parents&amp;#39; place was amazing. It was over 2 hours long. It was emotional but made me feel really optimistic. It was my first time talking to him in a week. He explained to me that he had fallen into a depressive episode. He felt awful about not coming back to the Airbnb before I was leaving and that he didn&amp;#39;t know how to tell me. He had planned on coming back but ended up being offered a job through his dad&amp;#39;s company so he could get something on his resume. Unfortunately, the meetings he had to go to ended up being really close to when I was going to leave, so flying back didn&amp;#39;t make sense. He said he shut down and dissociated for days, just staring at a wall, and focusing on his job search when he could. He felt so guilty about everything he had done to me. I assured him it was okay and that it was hard for me, but I forgave him. I read him my letter. He broke down crying and said I had hit the nail on the head throughout the entire thing. About how he was feeling, about what I needed to do to get better, and about our dream for a beautiful future together. He initially broke down crying when I read the part about his depression, and how I suspected it made him feel like he didn&amp;#39;t deserve me. How he shut down in the relationship every time his communication issues hurt me. How he would ruminate about losing the love of his life due to his mistakes/struggles. I told him he deserved the relationship. That I loved him. That I was done putting timelines on him to fix the whole mess. That I wanted to be patient with him, and be here to support him. That I was done trying to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; him. That I was just doing that because I hated seeing him in pain and wanted to rip that pain away from him, but realized I couldn&amp;#39;t. That he just needed time in California to rest and heal. That what he needed right now is love, support, and time, and that I wanted to give him those things. He cried and said he needed to hear this and that he was so happy that we were on the same page. He wanted a future with me but that it would take time. He said he loved me. He gave me so many reasons to feel optimistic about everything. He said he felt a weight fall from his shoulders. He said he was going to hang out with high school friends that night (the same ones that didn&amp;#39;t have a great impression of me from the music festival). I told him I was so excited for him to hangout with them and hoped he would have fun. We made plans to have a movie night online the next day. He told me he was going to contact our mutual friend that he had also been shutting out and planned to call him the next day. We said we loved each other and goodbye, and he told me we would talk soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been over two weeks. Our mutual friend (who is, by the way, one of his very best friends) still has not heard from him and was never messaged/called like my boyfriend told me he would. There could be so many reasons he isn&amp;#39;t talking to me right now, and I&amp;#39;m just sort of lost. I had a rough time the first couple of days because he promised me he would talk (like has happened before over the last couple of months) and then just disappeared. On top of that, two days after I got home/the phone call happened, my parents and I got into a fight where they both started emotional abusing me a little bit again. I started having a flashback during this. I eventually got myself out of the room with them and went up to my room, falling onto my bed sobbing. I, out of habit, messaged my boyfriend briefly explaining that my worst fears had come true and that my parents were being awful to me again. An hour later I realized that was a mistake and I was crossing a boundary that had never really been set, but that I knew was too much for him currently. I sent him a message saying I was sorry and I still was working on handling these situations without him/had slipped up. That I understood it was a lot to handle and I was sorry I had messaged him. I messaged a few days later on Christmas saying I would call later to wish him a Merry Christmas. That message went through. A few hours later after waking up with a fever/the flu, I called him but his phone was turned off. I messaged him saying I was sorry I didn&amp;#39;t call earlier because I had the flu, and that message never went through. His phone was completely shut off. I cried. I have pretty much cried most days since then. I have held off from trying to message him. I see him come online on Facebook every couple of days, just for a few minutes. He hasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; any of my messages, but I know you can read received messages with airplane mode on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is January 6th today. I haven&amp;#39;t tried to contact him since Christmas. It hurts. It hurts a lot, but I know he is struggling. I wish I could just wrap him up in a hug, but I am across the country and can&amp;#39;t. I have focused on finishing my Digital Marketing certificate (which should be done within the next few days) so I can get a couple of smaller certifications, and begin my job search for a remote job. I have been reading articles on depression, especially male depression, to try and understand what he is going through. I have read articles on how to anxious-avoidant relationships can be healed.  I know his therapist specifically focuses on attachment theory and does a lot of couples therapy to show couples how to properly communicate with each other to save their relationships. I have done a lot of self-work in the past couple of weeks. I have been meditating every day, getting time outside, learning better coping strategies from my current online therapist. I am hoping that my session with my new in-person therapist goes well tomorrow, as she specializes in trauma and works with EMDR and DBT. I haven&amp;#39;t started my SSRIs yet (I was prescribed generic Lexapro), as I didn&amp;#39;t want them to affect me getting this certification done in time, but plan on starting to take them next week. I talked to a mutual friend of my boyfriend and I&amp;#39;s last night, and she said I sound like a drastically different person to who I was a few weeks ago. She said she is proud of me for working so hard. I have been having dreams where I try to reach my boyfriend on the phone, but can&amp;#39;t because the people who have traumatized me are getting in the way of me contacting him. I realize I need to work on my traumas before I can continue a healthy relationship with him. I realize these things now but am scared. Logically, I know that I have so many reasons to trust that he eventually wants to work things out, but that he is just majorly struggling right now. He told me multiple times that he loves me, but just doesn&amp;#39;t have the tools currently to offer what I need, but that he is working on getting them. That it will take time. I understand this, but my anxiety is eating away at me, telling me he wants to break up with me. Convincing me that he never wants to talk to me again/hasn&amp;#39;t contacted me because he is scared to break up with me. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where the last couple of days it has been hard for me to get out of bed. I feel like I&amp;#39;m taking on a couple of symptoms of depression. I have to peel myself away from working at my laptop just to go curl up in bed and sob. I&amp;#39;m learning to self-soothe because I was neglected as a child. It&amp;#39;s hard, but I&amp;#39;m trying my best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I just need some perspective from the other side since my boyfriend obviously is having a hard time communicating right now. I have a hunch he feels guilty that he isn&amp;#39;t contacting me. That he is worried that when he eventually contacts me, I&amp;#39;m going to be mad at him for ghosting me and just break up with him. I know he has said he doesn&amp;#39;t want to feel like a burden to me (something we both struggle with feeling). Do I send him a short message just letting him know I&amp;#39;m still here? I have been contemplating for the past few days just sending him something along the lines of &amp;quot;Hey, I don&amp;#39;t expect an answer to this message, but I just want you to know that you are loved. I love you and I am sending hugs. I&amp;#39;m here if you ever need me.&amp;quot; However, I keep getting hung up on if this will push him away or if he will appreciate this. I don&amp;#39;t know if it will annoy him and he just actually wants space? Or if he is feeling scared of abandonment and would like to know I&amp;#39;m still here for him. On top of all of this, I have no clue what is happening with his dog. They didn&amp;#39;t euthanize him over Thanksgiving and I guess were planning to do it around the holidays while his brother was home. My boyfriend has had this dog since he was 11, he is 22 now. That&amp;#39;s half of his life. It&amp;#39;s devastating for him, and I feel horrible. Before he left for Thanksgiving I asked him to give me a heads up for when they decided to put his dog down, because I wanted to send him a letter to read to his dog from me. I know that my boyfriend was extremely torn up about me never getting to meet his dog. He cried when I suggested the letter and said he would really appreciate this a lot, and said it would be really special. So I&amp;#39;m half wondering if something happened with his dog and he feels guilty telling me/is just even more depressed because his childhood dog is gone? I could definitely see him feeling guilty about me never getting to meet the dog because he wanted me to so badly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m just a little lost, trying to make up stories in my mind of what is going on to keep myself sane. I know I won&amp;#39;t know the truth until he decides to talk to me. We have our stuff together, near our old apartment in another state, in a storage unit. I have his DJ controller (which is a prized possession of his) because he left it at the Airbnb, intending to get it when he came back to get it. It&amp;#39;s not like we are never going to talk again, and it really does seem to me (despite what my anxiety tries to tell me) that he wants this to work out. I guess I just want to be as supportive as possible but am struggling with how to do that without hurting him more. I feel guilty as hell for my own actions throughout the relationship. He means the world to me. I never got that excited about having a future with anyone (even after dating my ex for almost 5 years I would roll my eyes if he ever brought up marriage or some further commitment), but I can see a future with my boyfriend. Our dreams are so weirdly similar. I know this post has been a highlight real of our bad moments (specifically mine because I don&amp;#39;t feel that I am in a place to start blaming him for the things his depression has caused him to do), but when we are both having good mental health days this relationship is a dream. We are happy with each other. He expresses to me that he loves me more than he has ever loved anyone. That most of his favorite memories include me. We push each other to follow our dreams, to be better people, to be happy, but our unresolved mental health issues have caused us both to get SO scared of losing this relationship, that we have both fucked up. He pushes me away by distancing himself from me. I push him away by self-sabotaging both myself and the relationship. I want a future with him. I want this to work out, even if it takes a lot of time. I understand that his depression may never &amp;quot;go away&amp;quot;, and just want to learn how to support him and be there for him when those hard times come. I know my anxiety is making me be impatient as hell, which is why I&amp;#39;m directing my worries to Reddit and therapy both today and tomorrow (and of course weekly in the future). How can I support this person I love so fucking much after I unintentionally pushed him away because of my own unresolved traumas? How can I support this person who is terrified of losing me, so he isolates himself so he doesn&amp;#39;t do anything to hurt me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far. Thank you. This took me a long time to write and scrolling back I realize how long it is. I hate that so much has happened in such a short time in this relationship. I kind of want to propose (once he is ready) that we &amp;quot;start over&amp;quot; in a sense. I want to live in my own apartment for a year (once we decide to move to the state we want to move to) so I am not overwhelming him when I have bad days, and so I can learn to support myself through my bad moments. So I can reparent the inner child within me that has been lost for years, that is causing me issues now. I expressed to him in our phone call a couple of weeks ago that I want to get &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; back after having my identity ripped away from me in my previous abusive relationship. I want to develop hobbies that I&amp;#39;m not trying to monetize. I want to get some friends outside of our mutual friend group so I can have nights out without my boyfriend/our mutual friends. So I can develop a life of my own, so I can have the ability to have a healthy commitment with my boyfriend. I love him so much and want us both to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekybbw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "winter-fox222", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekybbw/boyfriend_with_depression_shutting_me_out_after/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekybbw/boyfriend_with_depression_shutting_me_out_after/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578336451.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "All my life I've hated drugs and cigarettes.

Had to get my first colonoscopy which sucked\n\n20: was still a virgin and never had a gf, seriously contemplated suicide but didn’t go through with it because of my family\n\n22: got fired from the startup I founded and had to move to Arizona for a job I hated\n\n25: had over half my body covered in psoriasis, had a negative net worth, a gf that ended up ghosting me, and a job I despised\n\nNow I’m 30 and I feel like I’m back to where I was when I was 23: I got a girl pregnant last year, lost more money then I can explain, got fired for the second time from the company I founded, my gf just got into a terrible car accident that I blame myself for, and I no longer can trust any of my family members. I’ve also been unemployed for 6 months and feel worthless.\n\nPlease if you’re young (or even old) know that it will usually get better. Sometimes it doesn’t, but that’s ok. I wake up with horrible stomach pains everyday but I’d take that over being dead. Also, it’s pretty much impossible to always be happy. Everything is relative and we need to experience the lows in life, to have something to compare the good things too.\n\nI’ve also been focusing on sharing gratitude recently.

I’ve learned just talking or putting things into words can help us all:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18: I was diagnosed with psoriasis and Crohn’s disease and thought my life was over. Had to get my first colonoscopy which sucked&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20: was still a virgin and never had a gf, seriously contemplated suicide but didn’t go through with it because of my family&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22: got fired from the startup I founded and had to move to Arizona for a job I hated&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25: had over half my body covered in psoriasis, had a negative net worth, a gf that ended up ghosting me, and a job I despised&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I’m 30 and I feel like I’m back to where I was when I was 23: I got a girl pregnant last year, lost more money then I can explain, got fired for the second time from the company I founded, my gf just got into a terrible car accident that I blame myself for, and I no longer can trust any of my family members. I’ve also been unemployed for 6 months and feel worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please if you’re young (or even old) know that it will usually get better. Sometimes it doesn’t, but that’s ok. I wake up with horrible stomach pains everyday but I’d take that over being dead. Also, it’s pretty much impossible to always be happy. Everything is relative and we need to experience the lows in life, to have something to compare the good things too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been focusing on sharing gratitude recently. So thanks to everyone on this subreddit for sharing their stories. Being open to complete strangers on the internet seems weird, but it’s definitely therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "eky05e", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AffectionateYellow8", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eky05e/things_ive_gone_through/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eky05e/things_ive_gone_through/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578335110.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I am 25 and I finished my degree in IT (I live in Norway). \n\nMy main problem is everyone seems to get stuff handed to them on a silver plate.\n\nI have been applying for a job 1.5 years and all my other friends got their jobs instantly and it kills me to know how easily they get stuff in their lap.

After 3 plus years of adderall use I quit cold Turkey when my son was born. I experienced 3 months of the worst depression of my life. Luckily I worked from home and was able to also be a full time father while my girlfriend worked serving tables.

I even have been robbed and jumped 13 times while I was homeless and had a guy shoot a  gun near my left ear which has caused some hearing loss in my left ear that is permanent. \n\nBefore I was homeless I was kept on our ten acres of property, never left it, never went to school. Didn't know how to read or write until I was 19 to 20 years old. Spent my entire child and teen hood on the ten acres of land we had. Isolated away from the world.\n\nI been single my entire life and never even had a date or a woman who wanted me. both my parents are dead. my real dad I knew for only a few months died of liver failure when I was 23, my mom died when I was 25 of suicide. my grandma when I was 17. I have no other friends, no other family in this world. I am utterly alone.\n\nPast ten years I have tried to get my GED, a job, my own place, a car, a girlfriend and in that entire time I have spent trying to lose weight as well.

I liked the job and the people, but felt overwhelmed and incapable of doing it which led me into a major depressive episode and hospitalization for the first time.\n\nMy job has been insanely understanding with me. They gave me a month of temporary disability (well, their disability insurer did, but they have told me my job is still waiting for me when I'm ready). I'm not sure I'll ever be ready to go back though. My therapist recommended I ask to be eased in or to switch roles from kitchen to something less stressful. Advice on the other hand is just guiding me towards less stressful jobs. These both seem like temporary fixes that won't do anything to solve the root of the problem: Why am I getting so upset and overwhelmed by every job I have?

On the Reddit, talking to total strangers just so I can talk to someone. I would like to talk so much but I cant find the right words. Im 18 now and I was outsider my whole life. When I was on elementary school I used to have few friends. But they were that kind of friends who really didnt care about me. We were just talking to each other, some childish jokes and thats it. Later on the high school I was not able to find any new friends. I had girlfriend once, for few months but nothing serious. Now Im studying second high school and I still dont have friends.  Honestly I have one online friend, its good friend, probably best I ever had.  But we cant even talk to each other now because he is going to hard stage of his life. Its will be 2 years since we really talked and played something together. Sometimes we talk on Messenger. Not really often. Im trying to help him get through his hard times. Its just that I really miss him. He knows that but we just cant do anything with it now. I have deppresion for years but when I was talking with him, it wasnt hurting so much. We were talking daily. That was something I lived for. I was going through everyday shit and I was thinking about evening when we call each other and will have fun. Since we cant speak with each other, I fully sank into deppresion. I cant enjoy anything. One thing that keeps my mouth and nose above the waters of depression so I dont drown is that I started drinking coffee daily. Its like, I wake up and I know I will sit down in the evening and have my cup of coffee, so somehow I manage make it that day. Thats what keeps me alive now. Coffee. Pathetic. Pathetic life of mine. I used to play lot of games, it helped me to numb that feelings. I used to forget about my shitty life and play whole day and night. It wont help now. I just turn on computer to play something and Im bored, I feel down, I wont help me anymore. I just sit behind me computer, staring on the screen with some game on in and thats it. Im also trying to create some art. You know, painting, writing books, texts for songs, music, poems, etc. It also used to help a little. Now, now Im stuck with half finished book, finished lyrics for one and half album, few music demos, some poems and currently one painting Im \"working on\". It wont help anymore. Everything I paint, write, compose feels so shitty, so cheap. I even tryed to find somebody to work on art with. Due to my social anxiety, it is nearly impossible for me. I even tryed to find somebody on places like r/BedroomBands. Nothing. Im still alone. I would like to finish it all and start new projects but everytime I try to do so theres a voice somewhere in my head telling me why should I do that, it has no meaning, no future. Since this was what I lived for since I was young, it is really hard when I feel like Im loosing it. I got it, Im 18 I have many years to do something with my art and with my life and friendship etc., I heard things like that many many times. I tryed to speak with my mom about my depresison. She is amazing human being, very nice lady. She had hard childhood. And lot of struggles with her mom. I know she love me and I love her. But I think she dont understand. When I speak with her about my depression shes trying to help me with things like I need to change my view on the word and that I have lot of time to make my life better and things like that. I understand shes trying to help me but that is just not working. I stopped talking about that with her since it was one big circle(For anybody asking, yes I went to see terapist because of my depression, couple of them. It didnt help me at all. I didnt want to take some medical drugs beacuse I felt that if I would take it, that person after that wouldnt be me. Also I dont want to have depression in any of my medical records and since I studied nursing school and I kind of know how these kind of medicine can fuck you up, I dont want to take it for that reason too.). I dont feel suicidal but I just dont want to live. I dont want to kill myself, Im not somebody who hurt/cut himself because of depression. Depression itself hurts like hell. I wish it would all stop. In the Freddies words:  I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. Since I wrote this, I will say that I love music. It used to be my analgesic. Now, same as other things it wont help anymore. I hate my life, I hate myself and I hate everyting I do. Im tired of life and it didnt even started. I dont know what to do.\n\nSo yea. Thats my life. For anybody else with depression reading this. I hope you will get better. I really dont know what I should say to you other then find some small thing you can do everyday that helps you keep going and hold on. Keep on hoping that one day all of that pain will be gone and you will be happy. Thats all I can say. Thats all I do to make it through another day.

It would also be cool if you had a picture of yourself, I don’t care about what you look like or anything It’s just nice to put a face to the name you know? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also this is me if that matters to you at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/BwCsnmi\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/BwCsnmi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With love,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your soon to be pal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekwj8n", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ryfry314", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekwj8n/i_am_looking_for_someone_to_help_keep_me_alive/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekwj8n/i_am_looking_for_someone_to_help_keep_me_alive/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578328846.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Gonna post this in a few subreddits, and thought this would be a good one. \nTo start: I am a 19 year old university student (male) studying math and economics. I go to a decent state school and never once questioned my academic ability; I always thought I was a bright kid, was always at the top-ish of my class, was the type of person who never studied but was naturally good at taking tests,etc. I say this not to ‘brag’ but as to shed light on what kind of a person I have always been, until recently. Basically, although my memory wasn’t the greatest, it was NEVER this terrible.  Ever since starting university last year (I’m entering my 4th semester, graduating next year), my sleep schedule got completely destroyed. Besides my two roommates and maybe one or two friends, I have never seen a schedule as strange as mine. We would generally go to bed around 4 am, waking up around 12-1 pm, go to our afternoon classes, come back and nap for 2 hours, go to class in the evening, nap for another 2 hours around 8pm ish, then stay up all night not because we want to but because we literally can’t fall asleep. This went on all first year and continued this year so far (but this time going to bed around 6 am). I really don’t know why we do this but we do. I hate it, but the amount of effort it would take to fix has prevented me from doing so. Anyways, back to why I’m saying this in the first place. My memory is completely shot, to the point where I sometimes can’t remember what people say to me right after they say it. Sometimes I forget where I just went or what I did, and sometimes it usually doesn’t even feel like it happened. I can hardly remember what I’ve had for breakfast most days, although I usually never eat it anyway.. I can’t even remember what I did yesterday. Time seems to fly by incredibly fast, and life seems blurry. My mind is foggy. I’ve smoked weed and drank alcohol recreationally in my teens but not to the point where I would consider it a problem; I’ve always done my work first, and have only ever done it with friends on weekends. Never done any other drugs. I eat pretty shitty I guess, but that’s because of the dining hall. I’m going to be honest, and I’ve never really said this to anyone before. I’m scared shitless. I’m so scared. I know this isn’t normal and I don’t know how to fix it. Of course my first thought is Alzheimer’s or dementia. I know the chances of that at 19 are slim to none, but if you were in my position you would consider the worst, too. I’m so scared I don’t know what to do. The whole thing is quite confusing though. If I really had dementia or some memory disease, then how can I manage to do well in school? How can I remember how to do complex math? How can I remember everyone of my friends birthdays and lyrics to pretty much every Beatles song, but not what I did 5 minutes ago? I don’t understand it. The most infuriating thing. The reason I brought up my sleep situation is because along with the doctor I forced my dad to bring me to, pretty much every one says ‘get more sleep, eat better, lose stress/anxiety’... the same old shit. It of course makes sense, but I just don’t think it’s that easy. My mind is so fucking foggy and I wouldn’t wish this on anyone ever; it feels like I’m not even living life. What’s the point of living if I can’t fucking remember anything? Life is just the summation of your memories, and if I don’t have that then I must have nothing. I broke up with my girlfriend about 4 months ago and was kinda depressed for like a month, with waves of it coming here and there especially when I see her. I figured I would throw that in, because maybe it has something to do with it. Or maybe not. Every single night I lie awake thinking about what a terrible state I’m in, and the worst part is that no one has been able to relate. No one gets what I’m saying or how I feel. Most people just laugh, call me stupid, or pretend like I have dementia. It kills me, it really does. I’ve never been a suicidal person or had thoughts about it, but if there was ever anything that would make me consider it, this is probably it. It really is that bad. I just want help from someone or something so I can move on with life. Medication or something, whatever it takes. I’m studying abroad in London completely by myself and leave in 2 days, which has increased my anxiety and nervousness 1000 fold. I’m considering not even going and just staying home for a semester. If anyone can interpret anything I just said or is able to help me, I would be the happiest person. I’m probably gonna forget I even posted this, but oh well.

I figured no one knows my life story anyway and  if I leave, I could leave remnants of it somewhere before I do)\n\nYes it's probably all subjective. But no, not really.\n\nI was beaten as a kid by my father and he dangled me out of the 8th storey window, my mother said I was her least favorite, and I was bullied in elementary school. I went around asking people to \"be my best friend\" and they looked uncomfortable. I had no one. \n\nThe beatings stopped when I turned 13, and gradually I became known as the smart and pretty one. Till today I still don't truly believe I am pretty. As I got older, I became the one who looked significantly younger than her age, the smart one, the hardworking one, the one who always helped people. But I rarely received as much help in return. \n\nNow, guys who are significantly younger (legal) are always the ones who like me. I'm flattered but I'm not interested. It's hard for me to think about it when I'm struggling like this and not feeling good about myself. Then come the questions of why I’m not married yet. And I know I should be happy and grateful to be 'pretty', but 'pretty' doesn't solve my problems.\n\nDo you ever notice friends want to hang out with you more if you are financially stable, successful, and more so if you are coupled up? I don't understand this concept. I'm none of the above so I don't really go out anymore. \n\nWhen I was 14, an adult stranger leaned over, pretended to ask me for the time, and molested me on a bus. He wore glasses, and a white polo tee. That's all I remember. It was the first time I was touched sexually and till today, I get anxiety attacks if a man I do not know sits next to me on a bus.\n\nMy last two exes were terrible. One constantly slut-shamed me, controlled me, then cheated on me with two different people and gaslit me terribly by blaming me for his cheating. \n\nThe other one abused me, and blamed me for his taking drugs to relief his stress from our relationship (I had never taken drugs). He raped me when I was too weak from a serious flu and threatened to kill me by crashing his car and zipping in and out of traffic as he was making his point. He was never by my side when I was at the hospital doing test after test. \n\nWe attended counseling sessions and the therapist took his side. She enabled and empowered my abuser and was compassionate to him even after listening to both sides. So he'd tell me, 'see it's not my fault. Even the therapist said so'. She was constantly cold to me despite telling her all of the above.  \n\nBoth these exes constantly emotionally abused me. Never in my life have I ever cheated on any boyfriends. I did so much for them. Why was I treated this way? \n\nI share a tiny room with my sister (yes I still live at home. It's common in my culture to do so until you are married... though, what I wouldn't give to have enough money to move out) and she is constantly emotionally abusive. She leaves me notes swearing at me  to not touch her food (I never did), or throws my stuff out. I really don't want her in my life. \n\nI turned to work because I could see I was good at it. People said I was too. But in order to make it as a freelancer in my industry, you have to be willing to be exploited, be willing to be subject to racism and sexism. I'm not, so I became depressed and exhausted because I didn’t see why I had to be paid lower than a white man with no experience. Companies keep\nexploiting us and take ages to pay. It’s become so bad that if you are not willing to be exploited, they simply won’t hire you. They’d rather have mediocre or bad work done at a much lower rate. \n\nI decided it's time for a career change. I became very interested in one other career. I looked into it. Talked to people from different parts of the world. Turns out, only the US has this job (I'm not based in the US). And in order to do it, I need to do a 1-2 year degree course and be certified. One employer told me that being a foreigner, it's unlikely I will be hired because the pay scale is too low to warrant work visa sponsorship. \n\nNo other career has caught my attention. I hate front line work so retail is out. Money may not be able to buy happiness but it sure as hell can solve a lot of problems that could prevent worsening depression in a lot of people.\n\nI'm broke AF. I have a massive 5-digit debt and no full-time employment despite YEARS of applying to jobs both in my industry and outside of it. How would I be able to even save up for a degree overseas? A lot of plans to pay off debts only work if you have full-time employment. \n\nI have a lot of mental health issues and a serious thyroid condition, the latter of which I have to take meds for, for the rest of my life, but I can't afford the meds. \n\nI'm trapped. This is constant. And overwhelming.\n\nI HATE when people tell me it will get better. It doesn't for everyone. It hasn't. I've tried hard. I HATE when people tell me to go to a hospital or call hotlines (these hotlines are fucking useless where I am). I have no money, and I'd been to therapy, tried meds, been to the hospital before. It does not work for me. I HATE when people tell me this person and that will be hurt from my death. What a joke. Erm, read the above. NO ONE WILL BE. And if they do, it's more self-serving and inauthentic. \n\nSometimes kind strangers on the Internet offer up this long speech about life, but when you reply, they see they don't have any solutions or perspective for you and the conversation ends. This keeps happening.\n\nI know exactly what I need. I need full-time employment, I need money, I need to get out of my country to have a remote chance at happiness. Nothing else will work. **I've already tried. For years.** So who can help me really? No one, right? Exactly. There are no solutions here.\n\nWhat quality of life do I have, what dignity do I have, living like this? Why be selfish by telling me to stay on?

I figured no one knows my life story anyway and  if I leave, I could leave remnants of it somewhere before I do)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes it&amp;#39;s probably all subjective. But no, not really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was beaten as a kid by my father and he dangled me out of the 8th storey window, my mother said I was her least favorite, and I was bullied in elementary school. I went around asking people to &amp;quot;be my best friend&amp;quot; and they looked uncomfortable. I had no one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beatings stopped when I turned 13, and gradually I became known as the smart and pretty one. Till today I still don&amp;#39;t truly believe I am pretty. As I got older, I became the one who looked significantly younger than her age, the smart one, the hardworking one, the one who always helped people. But I rarely received as much help in return. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, guys who are significantly younger (legal) are always the ones who like me. I&amp;#39;m flattered but I&amp;#39;m not interested. It&amp;#39;s hard for me to think about it when I&amp;#39;m struggling like this and not feeling good about myself. Then come the questions of why I’m not married yet. And I know I should be happy and grateful to be &amp;#39;pretty&amp;#39;, but &amp;#39;pretty&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t solve my problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you ever notice friends want to hang out with you more if you are financially stable, successful, and more so if you are coupled up? I don&amp;#39;t understand this concept. I&amp;#39;m none of the above so I don&amp;#39;t really go out anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 14, an adult stranger leaned over, pretended to ask me for the time, and molested me on a bus. He wore glasses, and a white polo tee. That&amp;#39;s all I remember. It was the first time I was touched sexually and till today, I get anxiety attacks if a man I do not know sits next to me on a bus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last two exes were terrible. One constantly slut-shamed me, controlled me, then cheated on me with two different people and gaslit me terribly by blaming me for his cheating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other one abused me, and blamed me for his taking drugs to relief his stress from our relationship (I had never taken drugs). He raped me when I was too weak from a serious flu and threatened to kill me by crashing his car and zipping in and out of traffic as he was making his point. He was never by my side when I was at the hospital doing test after test. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We attended counseling sessions and the therapist took his side. She enabled and empowered my abuser and was compassionate to him even after listening to both sides. So he&amp;#39;d tell me, &amp;#39;see it&amp;#39;s not my fault. Even the therapist said so&amp;#39;. She was constantly cold to me despite telling her all of the above.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both these exes constantly emotionally abused me. Never in my life have I ever cheated on any boyfriends. I did so much for them. Why was I treated this way? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I share a tiny room with my sister (yes I still live at home. It&amp;#39;s common in my culture to do so until you are married... though, what I wouldn&amp;#39;t give to have enough money to move out) and she is constantly emotionally abusive. She leaves me notes swearing at me  to not touch her food (I never did), or throws my stuff out. I really don&amp;#39;t want her in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to work because I could see I was good at it. People said I was too. But in order to make it as a freelancer in my industry, you have to be willing to be exploited, be willing to be subject to racism and sexism. I&amp;#39;m not, so I became depressed and exhausted because I didn’t see why I had to be paid lower than a white man with no experience. Companies keep\nexploiting us and take ages to pay. It’s become so bad that if you are not willing to be exploited, they simply won’t hire you. They’d rather have mediocre or bad work done at a much lower rate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided it&amp;#39;s time for a career change. I became very interested in one other career. I looked into it. Talked to people from different parts of the world. Turns out, only the US has this job (I&amp;#39;m not based in the US). And in order to do it, I need to do a 1-2 year degree course and be certified. One employer told me that being a foreigner, it&amp;#39;s unlikely I will be hired because the pay scale is too low to warrant work visa sponsorship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No other career has caught my attention. I hate front line work so retail is out. Money may not be able to buy happiness but it sure as hell can solve a lot of problems that could prevent worsening depression in a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m broke AF. I have a massive 5-digit debt and no full-time employment despite YEARS of applying to jobs both in my industry and outside of it. How would I be able to even save up for a degree overseas? A lot of plans to pay off debts only work if you have full-time employment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of mental health issues and a serious thyroid condition, the latter of which I have to take meds for, for the rest of my life, but I can&amp;#39;t afford the meds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trapped. This is constant. And overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I HATE when people tell me it will get better. It doesn&amp;#39;t for everyone. It hasn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve tried hard. I HATE when people tell me to go to a hospital or call hotlines (these hotlines are fucking useless where I am). I have no money, and I&amp;#39;d been to therapy, tried meds, been to the hospital before. It does not work for me. I HATE when people tell me this person and that will be hurt from my death. What a joke. Erm, read the above. NO ONE WILL BE. And if they do, it&amp;#39;s more self-serving and inauthentic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes kind strangers on the Internet offer up this long speech about life, but when you reply, they see they don&amp;#39;t have any solutions or perspective for you and the conversation ends. This keeps happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know exactly what I need. I need full-time employment, I need money, I need to get out of my country to have a remote chance at happiness. Nothing else will work. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already tried. For years.&lt;/strong&gt; So who can help me really? No one, right? Exactly. There are no solutions here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What quality of life do I have, what dignity do I have, living like this? Why be selfish by telling me to stay on? I&amp;#39;ve thought about it throughout my life, even when I was a child. May 2020 be my year, the year that I am finally released from all this. I only wish I had a buddy to comfort me and talk me through it till my final hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; Who has been through worse?

I've been anxious about studying this degree (don't know if you call it like that in english because I'm from spain and I'm lacking a bit of vocabulary here) since I was probably around 13 yo. My last year before starting college was probably one of the worst years of studying I've ever had, I started with almost no motivation to study because I hated what they were making me study, I really didn't want to study literature or how the phrases were built in a deep or more conceptual level, none of this really appealed to me. There were some times when I started having thoughts of dropping out, but i really didn't take them seriously, so i kept on going. And then finally I was there, almost after 5 years after I had decided what I wanted to study and make my carreer, I was there, but somehow it just felt empty. I always thought that once I entered college and would start to study what I wanted, I wouldn't need anyone to tell me that I had to do homework or that I had to study before exams or that i should start the projects early so I wouldn't be late for the deadline. Well, I was wrong, I have no motivation at all, I have a deadline due this sunday and I almost haven't done anything, also I have another project that happend a while ago which i failed and had to redo it by some time soon now, still haven't done anything about it. \n\nThen it should be easy for me to know that maybe I shouldn't be studying what I am studying right now, but what's true is that I really don't have anything more, all I do other than studying is get on my computer and wander through youtube or play videogames or watch some anime or read some manga just for the sake of it, with no purpose at all. Sometimes I play maybe a bit of LoL or minecraft with one friend and his gf and I really enjoy it, sometimes we have a gathering with the campaign we have on going of D&amp;D and that's really fun, I even bought some dice and can't stop thinking of new character ideas even though my first character is still alive and has a lot of development going on. Somehow I just can't help this uneasiness I have around what I'm doing, I've been going to they gym almost consistenlty for the past two years but it's been a month since I went \" 'cause it's holiday and I have to relax\", hell if I was going to relax, I can't even do that on holiday, it takes me more than an hour to get to sleep 'cause I can't stop thinking about the projects I have to do but somehow when the day starts I can't do anything that I said I'd do, somehow I just can't get to it. \n\nAlso two days ago I had a little chat with a friend that I hadn't talked to since about half a year, and he told me that I had this something that was enjoyable about talking to me and that if he was a girl he would've confessed to me already, he said no homo, (he actually did, also he has a gf and is not bisexual). That actually made me think and we went on the chatting and he started saying that I should get a gf that I'm too alone, and that's actually true I mean I've been single through out all of my life and I don't have many REAL friends, which I think is not that bad, I may have about 4 real friends that I can talk with and never get bored. The thing is that I've never once in my whole life have tried to actually make friends with someone, I don't even have one girl friend, all those friend I've had through out all this years have been because we shared something we had in common, mostly they were in my same class, but I haven't done a thing to keep those relationships, even one of those real friends I have now I almost lost all contact with him because we didn't study in the same high school anymore and I didn't bother contacting him, even though I really missed the times we spent together at class. \n\nLately I've been regretting a lot of things i did in highschool, not just that, the things I didn't do there. 3 years before graduating and entering college I had this group of friends, that was amazing, I would have a lot of fun at school and I really treasure those moments, but then I remember all I could've done if I hadn't been \"so busy\" playing League I would've been more friends than I am now with friends that I still have. I reall miss those times when I had a hell of a lot of real free time when I could do whatever I wanted to, but I just kept on being closed in my basement playing league. I really didn't start going out with friends since less than a year ago, before that I wouldn't go out of my house for anything, my friends wouldn't even invite me anymore because they knew I wouldn't accept, and not because they didn't want me to go.\n\nWell there it goes, I've somehow written a bit overall what I'm going through and my mindset.

This is my first post here. I feel kinda ashamed, because usually I don't bother friends or strangers with my problems, but in this case I don't know what else to do. I am 25M and I really love this one girl very much. We were in the same class and after we graduated I contacted her and we started going out and it was perfect, she was perfect and would go on to say how much she likes me and how happy we're going to be etc. Then all of a sudden she does an 180 and starts ghosting me and saying how she is going to Iceland to work and live, and she did, even found a new boyfriend for a bit over there. I was devastated, but I think I got through it somehow. But then two years later, she starts texting me out of the blue, saying how much she is sorry, how much she misses home and me, what a mistake it was to go etc. It immidiatley sparked the old feelings and I was in love and very happy once again. So she came back for a holiday and we saw each other and had the most amazing night. The deal was that she will go back to finish her work, tie up loose ends and come home after some months. She was so happy and looking forward to it as well as I. And now I recently wrote to her to wish her a happy new year while she was on a road trip through finland, russia etc. And all of a sudden she tells me that she doesn't think about coming back now, like it was nothing. That she fell in love with finland and wants to live there now. She broke my heart again, but now it's even worse. Every morning I wake up and my heart just sinks, I bareley get out of bed, I constantly cry or want to cry, like a little kid. I can't do my job properly, because I constantly think about her and my eyes water and such and I just don't know what to do. I can't eat even if I am hungry, I can't sleep properly. I reverted to myold habits, but nothing matters, I watch my favourite shows, I play my favourite video games, but feel nothing. I just want it to stop hurting, my chest is heavy and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. She is texting me too, sending me pictures from the road trip, she seems like she doesn't even take it seriously, laughing it off, saying that she must put herself first or that \"we'll see\" etc. I tried dating other girls, but they don't come even close to her and they end up dumping me too and I get even more depressed. I can't take it anymore, I just miss her so much, would do anything to just hug her one more time, I feel like I'll go insane, I just want it to stop, I can't even think straight, my head is a mess. So what should I do ? Should I tell her how heartbroken I am and ask her to reconsider ? Should I be angry and blame her ? Should I just act cool, like I don't care ? Or should I just seriously talk to her and offer her that I go to her instead and we can be together abroad ?

I just wished they would be a bit more concerned about it now, since I can only imagine what it takes to finally step up and say “I’m depressed” to those closest to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything or any resources I can point my parents to to understand what my cousin might be dealing with?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ektw80", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DANleDINOSAUR", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 1, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ektw80/cousin_claims_hes_depressed_family/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ektw80/cousin_claims_hes_depressed_family/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578315867.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I was having a somewhat decent time with my mum and niece then my brother decided to come round.

I’m just not motivated at all and I wish I could just go back home and lay in bed all day.\nAlso, I have athletic conditioning first period every day this semester, which is gonna suck. I’m pretty sure it’s just gonna be a bunch of assholes flexing on me because I’m weak or whatever. And getting sweaty before the rest of the day is going to suck.\nI just have no motivation and I see people looking at me because my skin looks like shit. I am not ready to return to the stresses of the school week. I need some help.

It was a new school, 10th grade, some old friends and made some new. Found myself (atleast as i tought back then) a girl that i liked and who liked me. I had no depression or anything like that so i was allways trying to cheer her up and so on. We had a good thing going but then about half a year in i learnt (not from her) that she actually had a bf but that she still liked me also. So we decided to just be friends and not make a big dealt cuz her bf knew of us and sayd as long it wasn't anything too much it would be ok (he was away for 6 months in service so he sayed he gets why). But then things started to get shitty. Her friends pressured her not to talk to me and wrote some letters to me trying to scare me. So soon she started to hate me for reasons i did not know at that time. So came along summer and depression. I had just lost my best and most trusted friend for reasons i back then didn't really know. Throughout summer i managed to get somewhat over it and was starting to get over the depression. Also yes i do have other friends but they are more for like gaming and stuff not trust.\n\nThen comes new school year. Before the first day she wrote to me and sayed that \"I still like you and want to be friends. I won't have any old friends and i still want to talk to  you.\" So for whatever reason i agreed on it and well things started to look up again. About a week later she also came clear why we had a fight and everything. Then we had two great school trips together. After the second trip she started to ignore me again. Then i learnt her bf had broken up with her, so i tried my best to support her if she needed. Things again were going great and she liked me even more (it was back in November 2019).\n\nSo fast forward to today. I went to speak with her after the holidays and see what's up. Well comes out she had found a new boy who liked her but she's still iffy on him. Well done me. I taught if i would give her time and not try anything that maybe we could be something then (i had made some plans to go somewhere in February), because i knew she still liked me very much as i was apparently her first choice  for prom before that and by the way she acts around me and in classes (or it might just be me).\nWell, this whole shit has boosted my depression now and i don't know what to do anymore. And i feel bad cuz i partly blame her new friend for it. She has been provoking her to write to other guys (immediately after the breakup) and do stuff she would not come to by herself and now because this new guy is also her friend she seems to be pleased with herself and smuggs any time they are near me. \n\nI'm sorry it's a long one but i just didn't know what to do so i thought venting here where no-one knows me (so i feel kinda safe) might help. Sorry if there are some typos, english isn't my main language.\n\nBtw i know i was dumb hoping for anything after the first time cuz there has now been like 4 times we've had a fight and not a small one, but every time she comes back around and wants to talk to me for whatever reason.\n\nHappy 2020 my ass.", "author_fullname": "t2_5dtxtztu", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Just trying some venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_eku5wr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578346213.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i don&amp;#39;t know where to begin...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the last school year everything was going well.

Someone that I put everything I had into. The good, the bad, the ugly — all of what made me who I was. Everything. And I failed. And it hurts.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong.

I didn’t think about what I wanted, what would make me happy. I wouldn’t ask for things that I couldn’t get myself and I never wanted to be a burden to someone else.

I wanted something to work out because it was with someone that I was passionate about, someone who I worked my ass off for day in and day out to see the smile on her face and to hear her laugh. This was someone that I supported with through the lowest times in her life and the highest. This was someone I love. What has me feeling this way is that for this first time, I was pursuing my own happiness. And I failed. \n\nMaybe I’m being a bitch about this. I probably am. But after so many times of putting myself out there for others, for fighting for things and people that I cared so deeply about, my body is tired and weak. My body actually hurts sometimes. I’m mentally exhausted and psychologically broken. My sleep schedule is off. I eat a meal a day if someone forces it down my throat. I feel empty inside, dreading every morning, praising every night.

Eventually i started to develop feelings towards her. I used to clean my room regularly, since she liked going to my room so we can study and do projects together. Those were the most wonderful, fun days in my life.\n\nThen things changed.\nMy bestfriend (let's call her Kana), she moved to Australia. She realized that being an illustrator is not the career path she wanted to pursuit, So she moved to Melbourne to study patisserie instead. To be honest when she told me that she's going to move abroad, i was really sad and probably still am. Nevertheless, she's my bestfriend so i'm happy that she finally found her true passion. \nI realized that my time was running out, i had to confess to her or at least tell her how i feel. I'm not handsome at all, below average even. So i really never had the courage to tell girls about my feelings because deep down i already knew that i'm going to be rejected. But Kana, i really love her. I love her so much that i can't stop thinking about her.

When she finally was out of sight, i went to smoke a cigarette and as i exhaled the smoke out of my mouth, tears started dropping out. People looked at me with confusion, but i didn't really care.\n\nDays after her departure went bleak, empty, and meaningless. Maybe i was just sad and this all will pass i thought. Yet, this persisted for so long. I started skipping classes, my body aches, and i was always tired! My bed was the most comfortable and 'safe' place for me.

And I stay up late doing this, usually getting up an hour or two before work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don’t think about anything that I do. Which isn’t all bad, I don’t lie in bed crying, think about killing myself, or pine desperately for social interaction. But sometimes I wish I did feel awful like that. If I felt so shitty and suicidal that I couldn’t get out of bed for work, I would know for sure that I’m still depressed. If I craved friendship, romance, and sex I would have some motivation to seek people out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel things so little that I worry, either that the depression’s gone and I’m just boring and content with a life of working and fiddling with my phone. Or I’ve lived with depression so long that I just don’t notice it’s there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekt16w", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "WokePossum", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekt16w/im_23_and_been_depressed_since_i_was_14_but_maybe/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekt16w/im_23_and_been_depressed_since_i_was_14_but_maybe/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578310871.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "Everyone has their battle scars, I know it's not just me.. but I'm really trying to work on myself.

I thought I could handle it, and just toughen myself through it, which I was doing so, my loving and caring girlfriend is an amazing help.  \n\n\nThe past two weeks, specifically the past week, its like my depression has doubled down, or maybe even more than that. I can't find anything enjoyable as much anymore, I'm stressing at work, and not being able to keep the bad things at the door like I'm supposed to at work, because the supported can sense it. I am struggling... physically with my girlfriend, she is loving and understanding but because I can't do like I used to, its stressing me out further. I am not on any medication because I wanted to beat this myself but can't, so I'm going to the GP to see if i can get some Antidepressants. However I've received a text from my boss, saying that she is worried about me and wants to talk to me before I start my shift... This is causing me more stress because I know what its about, and It is taking everything out of me not to just break down and collapse...

No energy. Completely zapped of every ounce of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father is trying to help me sort the kitchen out and hes a planner. I cant deal with that on a good day. I&amp;#39;m a doer. If it needs done I&amp;#39;ll get to it and do it. I cant say I&amp;#39;ll do it on x day and then stick to it as it feels like far too much pressure. Weird, maybe, but that&amp;#39;s how I work. Just like planning is how he works. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in he comes and says &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re forgetting we need to do this, this, this, this, this, this and this. We have x amount of days to get it done. Where are we going to start and when&amp;quot; \nI was already emptying one unit, and had already started. But because what I was doing wasnt in the plan he had created in his head...I hadn&amp;#39;t started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as i hear the whole list of all that needs to be done I end up completely deflated. He then gets frustrated with me and has stormed out saying he cant help if I&amp;#39;m not even going to set a plan of how to start. I HAD ALREADY STARTED! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m feeling like even more crap, on top of already feeling crap, along with being overwhelmed by the whole list. I&amp;#39;m going to bed after posting this for a nap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know, even when depressed I can get this done - just not if he keeps badgering me with the whole list repeatedly. Focus on one god damn thing at a time! I cant empty three cupboards at once. I just cant. So why does the second and third cupboard need to be mentioned as a matter or urgency while I&amp;#39;m doing cupboard one!? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have told him it overwhelms me when he throws off everything that needs to be done at once. \nYet he still keeps doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hes not the cause of my depression, nor is he really at fault at all.

Mom couldn’t afford to stay in California so we moved to Pennsylvania. That checked the box for my 4th house, and soon after my 5th school during my high school years. All of the moving around made me better at adapting to new situations, facing challenges instead of backing down,  helped me socialize better and open up to new people, among other things. But with it came a price, I always always in a new place, never built any meaningful relationships other than my friends back ‘home’, missing out on holidays where my most of my entire family gets together. That was hard. Missing out on stuff like prom, walking after graduation, parties, etc. because it didn’t feel right, these weren’t the people I grew up with and I would rather stay home and play video games with my friends back home. \n\nAfter graduation things took a turn for the worse. A month or so after graduating, I got a job as a dishwasher at a restaurant. The people there where involved in drug trades and had been in and out of jail. They welcomed me as a coworker and as a friend, and they all had a completely different walk of life than I’d ever seen in person. During that time all I would do was go to work, and then come home to a messy and dirty room, play video games, watch TV, smoke weed, my cigarettes or my vape, get drunk, and on occasion down a bottle of RoboCough to get high off of the DXM (dextromethorphan). When I was high or drunk I’d do stupid stuff for attention like go on Instagram live on my burner account with only close friends following and lie in the middle of the road or run outside in the snow in only my underwear and scream at 1am saying I’m tracking deer. It’s because I’ve always craved attention, being the funny guy, because in my elementary, middle and early high school years being the class clown or funny kid in the group was how I got friends and status. Now that I matured up a bit and moved around I didn’t have an outlet so insulting friends to make other friends laugh or acting stupid was my outlet. \n\n Pretty much every girl I’ve ever talked to that was attractive and nice to me I’d obsess with in my mind and fall in love with. But I’d never get the balls to ask them out because I had a bad self image of my body, thought I was stupid intellectually and maturity wise, and that I’d just move again so a relationship would be unsustainable. Due to that I was a virgin for the first 19 years of my life, until I paid a woman nearly 200 dollars to have sex with me for 20 minutes in a hotel room. I thought that would help me but it didn’t, it made me feel worse because it was awkward and I had no prior bond to her, no emotional connection or even acquaintance. Not to mention the PayPal transfer took nearly as long as the sex lasted, and that made the entire thing drag on and I almost just up and left. Every girl so far that I’ve known or met on tinder and tried to message just either left me on read or the replies where short and dry. Either I was doing something wrong, or for some reason they didn’t want to talk to me but I don’t try and keep a conversation going when it gets that dry so I just stop talking to them and move on. \n\n\nLast September I left my Moms house. I love her to death, it wasn’t a toxic environment, but I just couldn’t stand living out there anymore. I needed to be back with my friends and family, and I needed to start school so I could pursue my career. I told her my plans way ahead of time, saved my money from my second job (prep and line cook) and then drove out to California with all my necessary possessions with plans of moving in with a good friend and a friend I’d known since middle school but hadn’t been around a whole lot, plus 2 of the latters friends from college. It wasn’t where I grew up in California, but it was within a 2 hour drive of my grandparents, my Dad, and my hometown where the rest of my friends still lived.  Things where looking up, I was back in my home state, living on my own so to speak, and I was registered for a community college near the apartment and I just needed to get a job to pay rent and other expenses instead of bleeding my savings dry. \n\nThey kicked me out within 2 weeks. It started off with bad omens all around, when I made it out to California I stayed at my Dads for a night because it was 2am and I wanted to touch base with my hometown friends and get my truck registered with the state. The day I woke up after getting there me and my buddy started our drive up to the apartment. My truck broke down not 20 minutes after I left, blown spark plug and cylinder head. $725. But me and my buddy just packed as much of my stuff as we could into his truck and after towing mine to a local repair shop that my family recommended, we still made it to the apartment that night, with the mindset that we could just drop off our stuff and pick my truck up when the repair was done. The night we got up there, I was just super stressed because of the cross country drive, my truck breaking down, and being away from home on my own. When I walked in there where tons of people I didn’t know at all, apparently they invited guests over. That didn’t bother me, I was good with new people, right? I was filthy, so after walking in with a rubber fox mask I found in my buddies truck to get a few laughs, meeting the new people and grabbing a bite to eat I took a shower. I was excited to have a party in my own place, especially one with chicks, even though none of them where particularly attractive, except a slim black girl that was one of my new roommates girlfriend. None of that really mattered to me, I just wanted to party and have a good time, kick off my new independence. Unfortunately I went crazy with the freedom that had been gifted to me all at once. I got pretty drunk and started acting stupid like I always do, except when I get drunk it goes from acting stupid and funny to being insulting and slightly scary to outside viewers, especially those that don’t know me well. A few highlights include: \n\n1) Whispering to my middle school friend that I didn’t know terribly well (Deacon) “Hey I think Brandon’s girlfriend is eyeing me up. She’s hot, maybe she likes white boys too? (Brandon was his college roommate)\n\n2. Talking to an overweight Jewish girl and making her visibly uncomfortable by making jokes about how Jewish people control every media and entertainment  outlet, and when she tried to deny it I googled it and the article I stumbled upon about disproving the theory so happened to be written by a Jewish person, and I had a riot with that. \n\n3. Chatting up a big black woman, just asking her about her studies and general life stuff. It somehow escalated into her talking about how she was a virgin,  but knew a lot about penis size? And she said with my attitude I was probably small, to which I responded with maybe you should try me on for size then? She actually though that was kinda funny, cus she laughed. Then came the weirdest thing, she said her and her friends where leaving, so I said goodbye, see you next Thursday. Then she threw her sandal at my head, and I was like WTF? She then explained to me that her Mom told her when a guy says see you next (any day of the week) it means he’s calling you a cunt.  Even sober me would have been confused by that, but hindsight is telling me that it was just revenge for me being an asshole all night especially with her Jewish friend. \n\n4. This is the one I am least proud of, if you can believe that. Me, Deacon, some random dude, and Maria, a girl my good buddy that I drove up with (John) had a crush on where all sitting by the couch after most everyone else left talking about how John was talking to Maria earlier that night. Apparently his way of picking up girls was by jabbing at them and insulting them. I told Maria that’s not how you do it, and she said yeah that’s true but doesn’t that make you kind of a hypocrite? I told her that I wasn’t trying to pick up the first girl, I was only trying to talk to the black girl later so she’d sleep with me. She laughed, and said I could probably get her if I wanted. But here’s where things went really bad. We basically just started shit talking my friend John. He was drunk in the room over, the one me him and Deacon would be sharing. We talked about how he always slinks away and pouts at parties because he gets too wasted, can’t talk to girls and gets depressed. We talked about  how he should do this and that to correct it. This is my best friend and I’m just shit talking him because I’m drunk and I do whatever I feel like when I’m drunk. I told Maria hey he insults you but he likes you, he talks to me about you. She said I know but I don’t like how he talks to me. Me and Deacon crashed on the couches after everyone went home or went to their own rooms, just catching up. We talked about girls we liked in middle and high school, about our futures, etc. When we woke up, we learned that John was awake the whole time and could hear us. That really made me sad. I tried to play it off like yeah I wasn’t shit talking, I was just saying how I think you should approach women you’re interested in in a different way. Not cool what I did, but I apologized and we made up, as bro’s do, but I could tell it bothered him for a while. \n\nOver the next 2 weeks I ran with my freedom, and away from my demons. I couldn’t find a job, I was stressed over upcoming bills, and I resorted to my outlet of making fun and being stupid. I visited my family to attend to a wedding, but it ended up making me sad to see my cousins all getting married and propose to their girlfriends (one proposed the next day at his bday party) and I was thinking to myself how I’ll never have that happiness because of the way I act. I had conversations telling my friends when I got back to the apartment about how I want to drive on the wrong side of the high way and kill myself, about how when one made a joke about beating me up that he could try but I’d kill him in his sleep with my knife. I was kidding, I’d never actually follow through with that. Oddly specific for a joke though, no? My friend John has a snake and to feed it we got live rodents. On the way back from getting one I shook the bag and played with it, not hurting with it but just fucking with it, hoping it would shit itself and become all dizzy before the snake killed it. I displayed genuine red flags of psychotic behavior during my self hate and depression fueled state in the apartment. I was mad at myself, at the girl I paid to sleep with me on Venmo that blocked me and took my money, mad that I couldn’t get a job even though I went to 3 interviews for restaurant jobs, sad that I had no girlfriend, sad that the girl Deacon would set me up with (Maria’s friend) was too beautiful and kind to be with me (Maria’s  words). I was mad and sad and just exhausted with everything. I kept on pushing though, some nights with some drinks and a rant, some nights speeding down the highway (sober) enraged at myself for being so stupid to pay a tinder girl money to have sex with me before I even met her only to get blocked and lose money I should be saving while having no job. All of these things pushed my roommates to the brink and they kicked me out, citing the reasons above. \n\n~~Wow this is getting long, I better wrap it up lol~~\n\nSo how, after all this, am I ‘Winning’ ? From a readers perspective, I sound like a fucking asshole that deserves to be kicked out, be depressed, hate myself and find no love, no career, and no lifetime happiness. Well with the information I’ve given you, that would be the only correct take. I got kicked out about 4 months ago, and i took it like the biggest wake up call, like you’d take your alarm going off an hour late when you have an interview for a big promotion for your job. I moved in with my Dad the night I got kicked out, and applied to a job near there the next day, a better one than I’d ever had. Not top tier, just better pay, workplace environment, etc. They called me for an interview within 30 seconds of me submitting an application, for the next day. I went in and crushed it, got the job. I applied to a community college, and instead of just applying and letting it sit there and be useless, I went down, met with a counselor and told him my career path of choice. I registered for my classes, and I’m set to go in 3 weeks. I didn’t miss a single shift, show up late, and on the contrary I’ve stayed late and come in early many many times. I’ve saved more money than I’ve ever had with this job in the last few months than with my other 2 jobs over 1.5  years. Me and John didn’t talk for a month or so after they kicked me out, but me and him are cool now and hang with the group of mutual friends I’ve known  since I was barely out of diapers. I started eating better again, and I’m losing weight while having more energy and feeling better mentally and physically. I still have thoughts that plague me about ever finding a girl that will be crazy enough to spend her life with me, but I have a feeling that it will work out. I’ve changed my approach with women, and now instead of trying to be stupid or funny to try and get there attention, I just ask about how their life is going, work, what they like music wise, etc. I’m gonna start going to the gym again very soon, now that they’ve given me a consistent work schedule I can plan around. There’s also a couple of girls in my DMs and in real life that are actually responding like they don’t view me as a dead raccoon on the side of the road, so that’s awesome. I’m going to keep talking to them and then maybe ask one of them if I can take them out for coffee, or their favorite choice of restaurant, I don’t care. I just want to get to know one of them and see where it goes. Instead of trying to force myself to find a relationship, I’m just going to talk to them and see how it develops and progresses on it’s own, rather than try and set it up immediately or try and make them laugh and like me. \n\n* I’m winning because I feel better. \n\n* I’m winning because I don’t want to drive on the wrong side of the road and kill myself. \n\n* I’m winning because I am making active steps to improve my life and pursue my dreams and life goals. \n\n* I’m winning because I have a good job that I like working for that pays me a liveable rate. \n\n* I’m  winning because I don’t feel the need to make girls like me by trying to make them laugh and being stupid and taking it too far. \n\n* I’m winning because I’m sober. \n\n* I’m winning because I see my family as much as I want whenever I want. \n\n* I’m winning because I can go out and see my friends instead of being cooped up with nothing better to do than drugs and wallow in self pity and despair. \n\n* I’m winning because I’ve gotten better, I feel better, and it’s only getting better!", "author_fullname": "t2_t2d6t", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I’m Winning", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_eks1j4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1578305655.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578333361.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a rough few years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started when I moved away from my friends and my family, me and my Mom couldn’t afford to stay in California so we moved to Pennsylvania. That checked the box for my 4th house, and soon after my 5th school during my high school years. All of the moving around made me better at adapting to new situations, facing challenges instead of backing down,  helped me socialize better and open up to new people, among other things. But with it came a price, I always always in a new place, never built any meaningful relationships other than my friends back ‘home’, missing out on holidays where my most of my entire family gets together. That was hard. Missing out on stuff like prom, walking after graduation, parties, etc. because it didn’t feel right, these weren’t the people I grew up with and I would rather stay home and play video games with my friends back home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After graduation things took a turn for the worse. A month or so after graduating, I got a job as a dishwasher at a restaurant. The people there where involved in drug trades and had been in and out of jail. They welcomed me as a coworker and as a friend, and they all had a completely different walk of life than I’d ever seen in person. During that time all I would do was go to work, and then come home to a messy and dirty room, play video games, watch TV, smoke weed, my cigarettes or my vape, get drunk, and on occasion down a bottle of RoboCough to get high off of the DXM (dextromethorphan). When I was high or drunk I’d do stupid stuff for attention like go on Instagram live on my burner account with only close friends following and lie in the middle of the road or run outside in the snow in only my underwear and scream at 1am saying I’m tracking deer.

She spoke to me like I was the man of her dreams, and I did the same, I thought it was going so good. I had to leave school the first semester and I would have to take the bus to see her and we would stay at hotels just to see each other. It was my first relationship so I was bound to fuck up, learn some things about myself, which I did, time and time again. I hurt her so much, I would push her away because of my trust issues, and she would come back. Until she got sick of that on and off shit, and I agree, but now it’s been 1 month and I can’t get this poison out of my chest. It’s all my fault. Every last thing.

She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.\n\nThings seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc. \n\nOne day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.\n\nOn the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).\n\nWhen she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary. \n\nAfter her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.\n\nShe has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through. \n\nRight now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it. \n\nWe came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:\n\n* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)\n* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?\n* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?\n\nSorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know.

Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekrpk9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "eva_37", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekrpk9/my_friend_15f_is_going_to_kill_herself_in_less/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekrpk9/my_friend_15f_is_going_to_kill_herself_in_less/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578302360.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I've failed everything at life and it's because of my depression, social awkwardness, minimal life experience, I was fired and I've done nothing since and I'm an incel.

But 2 years later I had to come home because my legs were f\\*d up and I didn't have enough money to cover the therapy for it (was working as a waitress and bartender) so my parents offered to help me. I came back, legs got a little better and then I had to find a job. Thankfully found one near to my parents house and its an okay job, I cant complain. Its not THE DREAM but it is a safe and ok payed job. Thru that job I met my now boyfriend and everything seemed fine. \n\nAt the begining of last year, I started to really hate my job because it was just too much for me. I have no college degree so I always feel like the stupid one from the whole team. But that's fine because I  don't even think of me anymore as a smart person. I feel like a complete failure.\n\nMy dad got really sick at the end of September 2019. We found out he has a brain tumor (malignant, stage 4) and that fucking ruined me. I never had a close relationship with him, but thats my dad. the way I think, which is like 100% negative, I was already preparing for his funeral and THAT thought made me almost puke. not the thought itself but my way of thinking. this is my dad for christ sake I thought and here I am...making plans for his funeral. My bf keeps telling me it's normal to have such neg thoughts, but I must not cling to them, aknowledge them and move past them...but I cant do that.\n\nMy dad had an operation, it went \"well\" for what the tumor is. They don't know how much time he has left but its usually 1 - 5 years life expectancy. He is going thru chemo now and so far so good BUT STILL...it's hard, so hard for me and my mum because we are the only close relatives (my parents are 66 and 63 yrs old). ofc some of our family helps with what they can but the psychical \"work\" and stress...I cant deal with it anymore. I am just filled up to the top. Ofc I don't show that to my parents, I keep smiling but I cry whenever I can because then I feel at ease somehow. My bf doesn't understand that but he supports me where he cans. and that's another thing. my relationship atm isn't the best. I don't wanna be touched, and sex...no thank you. I feel disgusting. I changed weight the last months from normal to \" YOU HAVE TO EAT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE\" and atm I gained weight again. I started smoking again and have a glass of wine once or twice a week just to calm my nerves. My mom is soooo stressed and exsausted and it hurts me so so much because she is my best friend and my dad, due to the operation and constant mood swings, he treats her like shit. it breaks my heart everytime. I try to talk to him because he actually likes to talk to me and I try to calmly explain to him that she is a little bit tired (don't wanna make it sound like he is the trouble child) but it's like talking to a wall. (in the country and city we live in, there is no psychical support or something like where the hospital can suggest you on of their therapists, because they only have one). I took two weeks off just so I can somehow help in the household. It's chaotic.\n\nMy bf's and mine flat (it's basically the first floor of my parents house) is in my eyes PURE CHAOS. I didn't pay much attention to that before due to all the recent crap that has happened but now,whenever I have time I clean. Like an insane person and I am furious during that. I know that a lot of people will say that depression makes you feel unmotivated to do anything, and I was like that  for the whole 3 months now, didn't wash myself even though I had to go to work somedays. I just felt disgusting and I wanted to stay that way. I wanted to just run away from all this. I just want to vanish. \n\nI used to go to therapy before my dad got diagnosed (because of my OCD) but now I really dont have time and when i do, i just wanna do nothing and sleep and cry and cry until it makes me sick. I wanna scream. Insurance doesn't cover therapy so I have to go to a private one and each seasion is around 50 bucks which is for me atm, a lot. \n\nAll I see is chaos, and I just want it all to be gone. The chaos in the the house I can handle, even though my scoliosis isn't much happy about it, but the chaos in our lifes ....I'm scared..and I feel like a crybaby because of it. I don't talk to people about it anymore (my dad), I only say \"he's fine\" just so that i don't think about how nothing is fine. I fucking hate myself so much. I havent felt this hate in sooo long and its just pure shit. Im sorry if im talking nonsense, and nothing is really well written. I just wanna type because I cant scream. \n\nthen, a month ago, my dad had a heart attack in the middle of the night. That took the air out of lungs again. he got a stent placed and at the visiting hours I would just faint. Couldn't sleep or eat, I was just driving from home to the hospital and on and on. Two days later my dad got to go home and the stress in the house continued.\n\nI wanna be there for my family, but its hard once you realise in aaaall this shit that you dont even know your family. My dad is a workaholic and was never really home and my mom, she is the best mom. Even though my dad and I had our differences, I wanna be there for him but also I want to be gone. Gone from this earth. Like I never existed.\n\nmy bfs sometimes jokingly says something about when will we have kids (he is 32 and I just turned 26, 2 yrs together) and I tell him everytime - please dont mention this. I cant have a child in the middle of this. he is not stupid, he knows that but he tries to lift me up which he barely ever can and that breaks my heart. I've been more shitty to him recently, he is a chill guy and I was never chill and I dunno if I'll ever be. I feel like he doesnt do anything in the house (he does some of it) so I always have to tell him, like I'm his mom. I try to explain to him that I'd like that he cleans sometimes the toilet or makes lunch/dinner when I come home from work or the hospital. Sometimes he does, but not really and that makes me even more mad and upset. But at the end of the day he is a great guy, he would do ANYTHING for me, I know that this is also hard for him because he almost lost his dad due to cancer so I dont even know whom to speek to. I don't wanna remind him of his pain that he went thru so I just cry. I feel like Im a shitty gf and daughter but I try, i really do TRY to convince myself that all this will calm one day and I will be better but it feels like a massive lie. \n\nI apologize for the long post and my english and thank you for reading thi and I'm sorry if this isnt the place for it but I just wanted it out of me.\n\nI will try to be better. I will try to fight, don't know how but I will. \n\nGuys, stay safe !", "author_fullname": "t2_5drwwzqn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I'm tired", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "hidden": false, "pwls": 0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ekr60k", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "steward_reports": [], "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1578327554.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.depression", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just a rant because I just have to type this out of my system I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my past with depression and anxiety/panic and ocd disorder since my late teens and at the age of 21 it got kind of better but mostly because I changed my lifestyle - quit day drinking, smoking, eating like there is no tomorrow and I felt great (ofc the beginning was hard af), went to therapy regularly and I also went to live in a another country nearby.

It used to not be so bad, it still effected me but nowadays I’m a total wreck\n\nI don’t really feel comfortable around my friends anymore because of some embarrassing shit I’ve done recently, we’ve had good times in the past but now I tend to be more quiet around them, I’ve started to realize I don’t share many interests with them.\n\nI’ve just turned 18 and I’m graduating soon I feel like wasted my entire school life and there is no going back. Whenever I’m in class I’m scared I might break the chair I’m sitting on because it’s happened in the past. I wear shitty clothes because of my weight and anxiety.\n\nI’ve tried many times to lose my weight but I always give up. I’ve played football for two years but I did not improve at all, was the fattest one on my football team and didn’t see much play. I’ve tried working out regularly multiple times but never stuck to it\n\nI’m Native American and grew up on an extremely poor reservation, I lived with my mom and two brother and it was nice for the most part when everyone was sober.\nLooking back I miss being my self without any shame. \n\nI moved away from the rez to my sisters at the age 9-10 (grade 5). From their it started, I felt like and outsider with my sister and brother (dads side) the way they talked, and what talked about was different, same story at school. I think because of this I closed myself off in fear of embarrassment or being seen as weird, instead I tried to act differently. Great idea right?\n\nI hated school. In grade 7 (which is the first year of middle school) I used to stay up all night playing games and sleep during school, of course I had no friends. This stopped after grade 7 though and the rest of middle school actually wasn’t that bad. I got put into a class with a bunch of other natives, they were from a different tribe though, which meant I couldn’t really relate to them in that department. But it was still fun.\n\nGrade 10 (High school) is when it my anxiety started was getting worse. The older natives in grade 11 at the time were very judgmental, you had to act a certain way to not teased, I followed their behaviour and so did my friends. I always felt like I wasn’t myself when I was with my friends but I didn’t know what to do.\n\nDuring my time living with my sister and attending white schools I developed severe anxiety. Now I don’t say things very often. Any time I’m in class the anxiety hits even harder. At home is when the depression kicks in, I use Reddit, YouTube, Porn and Games to distract my self.\n\nAnytime I get a break from school I stay home all day. I’m sick of it.

It used to not be so bad, it still effected me but nowadays I’m a total wreck&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t really feel comfortable around my friends anymore because of some embarrassing shit I’ve done recently, we’ve had good times in the past but now I tend to be more quiet around them, I’ve started to realize I don’t share many interests with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve just turned 18 and I’m graduating soon I feel like wasted my entire school life and there is no going back. Whenever I’m in class I’m scared I might break the chair I’m sitting on because it’s happened in the past. I wear shitty clothes because of my weight and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried many times to lose my weight but I always give up. I’ve played football for two years but I did not improve at all, was the fattest one on my football team and didn’t see much play. I’ve tried working out regularly multiple times but never stuck to it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m Native American and grew up on an extremely poor reservation, I lived with my mom and two brother and it was nice for the most part when everyone was sober.\nLooking back I miss being my self without any shame. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved away from the rez to my sisters at the age 9-10 (grade 5). From their it started, I felt like and outsider with my sister and brother (dads side) the way they talked, and what talked about was different, same story at school. I think because of this I closed myself off in fear of embarrassment or being seen as weird, instead I tried to act differently. Great idea right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated school. In grade 7 (which is the first year of middle school) I used to stay up all night playing games and sleep during school, of course I had no friends. This stopped after grade 7 though and the rest of middle school actually wasn’t that bad. I got put into a class with a bunch of other natives, they were from a different tribe though, which meant I couldn’t really relate to them in that department. But it was still fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grade 10 (High school) is when it my anxiety started was getting worse. The older natives in grade 11 at the time were very judgmental, you had to act a certain way to not teased, I followed their behaviour and so did my friends. I always felt like I wasn’t myself when I was with my friends but I didn’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my time living with my sister and attending white schools I developed severe anxiety. Now I don’t say things very often. Any time I’m in class the anxiety hits even harder. At home is when the depression kicks in, I use Reddit, YouTube, Porn and Games to distract my self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime I get a break from school I stay home all day. I’m sick of it.

I haven't ate. I haven't drank--besides all the booze. God I want nothing more than to fucking die. And I know. \"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem\" and \"things will get better\" . Fucking bullshit. I remember consciously, seriously considering suicide since I was as ripe twelve years old, which boggles my fucking mind because I had no godforsaken idea how much worse things could possibly get. I'm an adult now, and every damn time I think I've hit rock bottom, I'm only proven wrong.\n\nI can't even remember the last time I felt truly alive, that I felt happy. This isn't living. There are reasons I guess, I was cheated out of a childhood, my family life was and is all sorts of layered fucked up, and I am so mentally damaged I realize that it is impossible for me to ever have a happy or fulfilling relationship, and I can only ever be damaged by those who claim to love me and damage those who I truly love. But in the end, it doesn't really matter why I want to die, just that I do, and I can't. And I know-- you're supposed to encourage me to live. But don't I have a right to die?? Don't I get to make that decision?? Why are we as a society so keen on forcing people to live who don't want to fucking be here?\n\nBut I can't die. Whoever said suicide is the easy way out didn't know what they were talking about. I've been planning for two days straight now, trying to come up with some godforsaken fullproof plan to disguise my suicide as an accident or a murder. If my family knew, they'd never forgive themselves and feel abandoned, if my boyfriend knew, he would be fucking destroyed, maybe for life. And worst of all, I have a very complicated and toxic relationship with an ex who I honestly still very deeply care about despite everything, and he knows I've been suicidal. He told me I wasn't allowed to do something as shitty as that, and if I killed myself, he promised that he would too. I know as sure as the sun rises that he would. I can't be responsible for his death too.\n\nI figured my only way out, and the best way, is if everyone thinks I died some other way, it will be hard, but they won't feel that I wanted to leave them. But god, there's no fucking foolproof way to pull this off, I've scrapped plan after plan after plan and I've just about given up and I feel so hopeless. I can't even kill myself. God, I can't even die, I can't even get any peace. I can't do this anymore, I've wanted to leave for so long. But I'm trapped. Trapped in some sort of hellish limbo, a nightmare in between life and death. I can never really live, but I can never really die. What am I supposed to do? What in sweet hell is someone like me supposed to do??\n\nI feel so stupid, I probably sound like an angry, mentally-ill drunk retard. And maybe I am. But I hurt so much. I'm crying so hard my chest hurts and my throat is all closed up, I can barely breathe. I've just gone through my belongings and thrown away everything I don't want to be remembered by, or want to be found after my death, if I can even get to that point. It's just wishful thinking in a sick and twisted way. I never thought I'd come to see death as such a blissful privilege. But here I am. I understand if you don't really have an answer for me.

I haven&amp;#39;t ate. I haven&amp;#39;t drank--besides all the booze. God I want nothing more than to fucking die. And I know. &amp;quot;Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;things will get better&amp;quot; . Fucking bullshit. I remember consciously, seriously considering suicide since I was as ripe twelve years old, which boggles my fucking mind because I had no godforsaken idea how much worse things could possibly get. I&amp;#39;m an adult now, and every damn time I think I&amp;#39;ve hit rock bottom, I&amp;#39;m only proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even remember the last time I felt truly alive, that I felt happy. This isn&amp;#39;t living. There are reasons I guess, I was cheated out of a childhood, my family life was and is all sorts of layered fucked up, and I am so mentally damaged I realize that it is impossible for me to ever have a happy or fulfilling relationship, and I can only ever be damaged by those who claim to love me and damage those who I truly love. But in the end, it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter why I want to die, just that I do, and I can&amp;#39;t. And I know-- you&amp;#39;re supposed to encourage me to live. But don&amp;#39;t I have a right to die?? Don&amp;#39;t I get to make that decision?? Why are we as a society so keen on forcing people to live who don&amp;#39;t want to fucking be here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t die. Whoever said suicide is the easy way out didn&amp;#39;t know what they were talking about. I&amp;#39;ve been planning for two days straight now, trying to come up with some godforsaken fullproof plan to disguise my suicide as an accident or a murder. If my family knew, they&amp;#39;d never forgive themselves and feel abandoned, if my boyfriend knew, he would be fucking destroyed, maybe for life. And worst of all, I have a very complicated and toxic relationship with an ex who I honestly still very deeply care about despite everything, and he knows I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal. He told me I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to do something as shitty as that, and if I killed myself, he promised that he would too. I know as sure as the sun rises that he would. I can&amp;#39;t be responsible for his death too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured my only way out, and the best way, is if everyone thinks I died some other way, it will be hard, but they won&amp;#39;t feel that I wanted to leave them. But god, there&amp;#39;s no fucking foolproof way to pull this off, I&amp;#39;ve scrapped plan after plan after plan and I&amp;#39;ve just about given up and I feel so hopeless. I can&amp;#39;t even kill myself. God, I can&amp;#39;t even die, I can&amp;#39;t even get any peace. I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore, I&amp;#39;ve wanted to leave for so long. But I&amp;#39;m trapped. Trapped in some sort of hellish limbo, a nightmare in between life and death. I can never really live, but I can never really die. What am I supposed to do? What in sweet hell is someone like me supposed to do??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so stupid, I probably sound like an angry, mentally-ill drunk retard. And maybe I am. But I hurt so much. I&amp;#39;m crying so hard my chest hurts and my throat is all closed up, I can barely breathe. I&amp;#39;ve just gone through my belongings and thrown away everything I don&amp;#39;t want to be remembered by, or want to be found after my death, if I can even get to that point. It&amp;#39;s just wishful thinking in a sick and twisted way. I never thought I&amp;#39;d come to see death as such a blissful privilege. But here I am. I understand if you don&amp;#39;t really have an answer for me. I don&amp;#39;t think there is one.

I&amp;#39;ve never had an ounce of initiative in my fucking life and all I&amp;#39;ve ever accomplished was off the merits of others. All my friends, all my accolades, anything that I&amp;#39;m worth to anybody, I worked to gain none of it. I constantly remind myself of how hollow of a person I am, how empty everything feels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh actually, one thing has changed in 3 years: I&amp;#39;ve stopped crying. I&amp;#39;ve stopped asking for help. My current psychological goal is to just accept that I&amp;#39;m doomed to live the way that I live. If nothing&amp;#39;s changed before, I don&amp;#39;t expect it to now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate my past self for being too timid, reserved, and bottled, I hate my future self for settling for life instead of enjoying it, and I hate my present self for being exactly who I thought I&amp;#39;d be 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekqq5f", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HEY_ITS_ME_UR_PM", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekqq5f/i_still_havent_done_anything_today_musings_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekqq5f/i_still_havent_done_anything_today_musings_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578295910.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I hope to get drafted and fucking shot.

I've been waking everyday feeling there is a void in my chest.\n\nI'm 22M, and I recently finished college and passed my licensure examinations last October. I am now at the point where my family expects me to get a job, get a girlfriend start a family etc. etc... and it fucking sucks... everybody seems to have moved forward, but I'm here wasting away... not even getting my shit together. I'm still having turmoils and clinging on to the regrets that I have deep down inside me.\n\nI was never anyone's best friend. I never truly opened myself to anyone, even my family. Heck, I don't even know who myself truly is, because I never had a personality or \"self\" to begin with. I only wore \"masks\" and put up a facade and acted out \"personas\" that conformed to the expectations of those around me. \n\nAt home, I acted out the persona of an obedient son, one who constantly helped out with housework and behaved well especially during family outings. When I was with the troublesome kids in high school, I wore the mask of an \"asshole student\", I broke school regulations, vandalised, ditched class, constantly sweared and talked trash, spread rumors and made fun of others. College came and I shifted my mask into \"diligent student\", and I consistently aced tests, and performed spectacularly academically. \n\nI polished this \"diligent college student\" mask so much, I did end up having remarkable grades and graduated with honor and awards. But that sums up my whole 5 years in college. Nothing spectacular happened. I was just a book smart asshole, and looking back I was \"that guy\" in class... The one kid who you don't even know belonged to the class, always sat alone in the corner seat, doesn't have someone for the \"find yourself a partner for the activity\" bullshits, never went out on parties, and practically never spoke to anyone about anything aside from schoolwork and academic stuff. College ended and I had to drop this mask, and I'm left with my blank self again.\n\nI worn so many masks throughout my life, that I don't know my true self and personality anymore. Our family and relatives know me as the sweet obedient son who is very helpful and follows parents orders without fail. While people in high school know me as an asshole, and people in college knows me as the genius anti-social kid. There are times when people actually called me out for acting like a completely different person and \"out of character\", since I've only been showing them a mask of myself. \n\nNeedless to say, this identity crisis maybe crippled my social life as nobody treated me as their \"friend\".

I&amp;#39;ve been waking everyday feeling there is a void in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 22M, and I recently finished college and passed my licensure examinations last October. I am now at the point where my family expects me to get a job, get a girlfriend start a family etc. etc... and it fucking sucks... everybody seems to have moved forward, but I&amp;#39;m here wasting away... not even getting my shit together. I&amp;#39;m still having turmoils and clinging on to the regrets that I have deep down inside me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was never anyone&amp;#39;s best friend. I never truly opened myself to anyone, even my family. Heck, I don&amp;#39;t even know who myself truly is, because I never had a personality or &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; to begin with. I only wore &amp;quot;masks&amp;quot; and put up a facade and acted out &amp;quot;personas&amp;quot; that conformed to the expectations of those around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At home, I acted out the persona of an obedient son, one who constantly helped out with housework and behaved well especially during family outings. When I was with the troublesome kids in high school, I wore the mask of an &amp;quot;asshole student&amp;quot;, I broke school regulations, vandalised, ditched class, constantly sweared and talked trash, spread rumors and made fun of others. College came and I shifted my mask into &amp;quot;diligent student&amp;quot;, and I consistently aced tests, and performed spectacularly academically. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I polished this &amp;quot;diligent college student&amp;quot; mask so much, I did end up having remarkable grades and graduated with honor and awards. But that sums up my whole 5 years in college. Nothing spectacular happened. I was just a book smart asshole, and looking back I was &amp;quot;that guy&amp;quot; in class... The one kid who you don&amp;#39;t even know belonged to the class, always sat alone in the corner seat, doesn&amp;#39;t have someone for the &amp;quot;find yourself a partner for the activity&amp;quot; bullshits, never went out on parties, and practically never spoke to anyone about anything aside from schoolwork and academic stuff. College ended and I had to drop this mask, and I&amp;#39;m left with my blank self again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worn so many masks throughout my life, that I don&amp;#39;t know my true self and personality anymore. Our family and relatives know me as the sweet obedient son who is very helpful and follows parents orders without fail. While people in high school know me as an asshole, and people in college knows me as the genius anti-social kid. There are times when people actually called me out for acting like a completely different person and &amp;quot;out of character&amp;quot;, since I&amp;#39;ve only been showing them a mask of myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this identity crisis maybe crippled my social life as nobody treated me as their &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot;.

She, nor NY grandmother were happy that I was diagnosed. \"You'll get over it... It is just a phase...\" Everyone knows the bs that others spew when they're not forced to confront their own inner demons. \n\nNeedless to say, for years I dealt with my depression and insomnia by simply being tired and pretending to be happy... And for a short while it did work. \n\nEarly 2014 I was a non-traditional college student (was over 18), and working about 50 hours a week and had broken up with my bf the christmas of 13.... It was not a good time for me personally... I was flunking out of school simply because I did not wish to go to school anymore... I was tired all of the time. I was told to talk to the school therapist and told him that at the rate I was going, within the year I would probably end it all. \n\nNeedless to say, he had me self admit to a psych hospital, only stayed 3 days because of lack of insurance. Was given even more diagnosis' to add to my list: generalized anxiety, something bad happened to me when I was 19. Insomnia turned into severe insomnia, and suicidal thoughts and ideations (basically thinking about all the ways to kill myself and how I would do it.) My mom and gma visited a couple of times and basically they were disappointed that i was admitted for contemplating suicide... That I \"shouldn't be there\"... \n\nTwo years ago borderline personality disorder was added to my roster... Mainly, in my opinion, because the Dr was an older gentleman and I told him in my past I was very promiscuous hadn't been at the time, but it is what it is. \n\nCurrently:\n\nI'm 32 years old now and have been battling this depression for half of my life. I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 months (promise this isn't a JNSO but this info is important... I think). He basically started off as a f**k buddies which turned into him living with me and us being together... He keeps flipping back and forth between telling people I'm hie girlfriend to just the chick he lives with, his words not mine. He gets onto me for reading, working on my cross stitch, or playing The Sims. He likes touching me, places i don't want him to touch when we are not in bed, but doesn't want me touching him, doesn't want to try new positions in the bedroom, doesn't really look at me period when we are being intimate... Yes I've tried talking to him about not touching me like that, he still does it, he wont even try foreplay ( says he doesn't believe in it), and wont even attempt new positions, the one time we tried missionary only lasted a few seconds and he couldnt do it because I was \"smiling too much\", whatever that means. \n\nMy issue is that my depression has been running rampant lately, I'm sad, dont want to get out of bed, dont want to go to work (im the one paying all the bills in the house) and when I have tried to talk to him about it all he tells me to \"get out of my head\". i keep trying to tell him its not as easy as it sounds but he just doesn't listen. \n\nLately i haven't been motivated to keep this relationship going... I want to push him away, make him leave me basically, because in my head, he doesnt care about me or my feelings, he doesn't want to be with me but he has no other option so he is staying with me until he can get back on his feet and then he will leave and I'll once more be alone.\n\nI'll be alone and I'll be able to end it all... I'll be able to just walk away from this bs I call a life, I gave y'all the basics of my diagnosis' there's a lot more to my life, not the worst but definitely not the best either. \n\nI find that I'm just tired of fighting, of pretending I'm happy just to make everyone else around me happy.

She, nor NY grandmother were happy that I was diagnosed. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll get over it... It is just a phase...&amp;quot; Everyone knows the bs that others spew when they&amp;#39;re not forced to confront their own inner demons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, for years I dealt with my depression and insomnia by simply being tired and pretending to be happy... And for a short while it did work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early 2014 I was a non-traditional college student (was over 18), and working about 50 hours a week and had broken up with my bf the christmas of 13.... It was not a good time for me personally... I was flunking out of school simply because I did not wish to go to school anymore... I was tired all of the time. I was told to talk to the school therapist and told him that at the rate I was going, within the year I would probably end it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, he had me self admit to a psych hospital, only stayed 3 days because of lack of insurance. Was given even more diagnosis&amp;#39; to add to my list: generalized anxiety, something bad happened to me when I was 19. Insomnia turned into severe insomnia, and suicidal thoughts and ideations (basically thinking about all the ways to kill myself and how I would do it.) My mom and gma visited a couple of times and basically they were disappointed that i was admitted for contemplating suicide... That I &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t be there&amp;quot;... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago borderline personality disorder was added to my roster... Mainly, in my opinion, because the Dr was an older gentleman and I told him in my past I was very promiscuous hadn&amp;#39;t been at the time, but it is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 32 years old now and have been battling this depression for half of my life. I&amp;#39;ve been with my boyfriend for about 6 months (promise this isn&amp;#39;t a JNSO but this info is important... I think). He basically started off as a f**k buddies which turned into him living with me and us being together... He keeps flipping back and forth between telling people I&amp;#39;m hie girlfriend to just the chick he lives with, his words not mine. He gets onto me for reading, working on my cross stitch, or playing The Sims. He likes touching me, places i don&amp;#39;t want him to touch when we are not in bed, but doesn&amp;#39;t want me touching him, doesn&amp;#39;t want to try new positions in the bedroom, doesn&amp;#39;t really look at me period when we are being intimate... Yes I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to him about not touching me like that, he still does it, he wont even try foreplay ( says he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in it), and wont even attempt new positions, the one time we tried missionary only lasted a few seconds and he couldnt do it because I was &amp;quot;smiling too much&amp;quot;, whatever that means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue is that my depression has been running rampant lately, I&amp;#39;m sad, dont want to get out of bed, dont want to go to work (im the one paying all the bills in the house) and when I have tried to talk to him about it all he tells me to &amp;quot;get out of my head&amp;quot;. i keep trying to tell him its not as easy as it sounds but he just doesn&amp;#39;t listen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately i haven&amp;#39;t been motivated to keep this relationship going... I want to push him away, make him leave me basically, because in my head, he doesnt care about me or my feelings, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be with me but he has no other option so he is staying with me until he can get back on his feet and then he will leave and I&amp;#39;ll once more be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be alone and I&amp;#39;ll be able to end it all... I&amp;#39;ll be able to just walk away from this bs I call a life, I gave y&amp;#39;all the basics of my diagnosis&amp;#39; there&amp;#39;s a lot more to my life, not the worst but definitely not the best either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find that I&amp;#39;m just tired of fighting, of pretending I&amp;#39;m happy just to make everyone else around me happy. I dont know what to do anymore... I&amp;#39;m simply exhausted... I don&amp;#39;t want to fight this anymore... I simply want to give up because I dont feel as if I have anything left to live for anymore because I don&amp;#39;t think this relationship, or whatever he wants to call it, is going to work out in the end. No I dont want to end my life because of that... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to end it all simply because I am tired...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekq6hv", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "earthrngoddess", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekq6hv/simply_tired/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekq6hv/simply_tired/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578292584.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I used to be a very avid reader.

In just a few months I’ll be graduating and separating from all my friends as I go onto college. I never realized how short high school is until it’s almost gone. All the great people and memories I’ve made will soon just be history. To top it off, this girl I’ve had a crush on for a while now is dating some crackhead junior and I don’t like it at all. I mean she looks happy which makes me happy, but I know that the way she has been acting around him isn’t truly how she is. It just sucks to see all these things come crashing down on you at once. I really don’t know what to do.. \n\nI had a small mental breakdown about a week ago and ever since then everything has seemed to be void of happiness. I’ve always been an introvert, but I do love being around people. It’s probably the one thing that really excites me. However, I’m  an empath so I base my emotions to match those around me so I can try and reason with them. I can smile hard for a picture but the second the shutter closes my face goes back to being emotionless.

In just a few months I’ll be graduating and separating from all my friends as I go onto college. I never realized how short high school is until it’s almost gone. All the great people and memories I’ve made will soon just be history. To top it off, this girl I’ve had a crush on for a while now is dating some crackhead junior and I don’t like it at all. I mean she looks happy which makes me happy, but I know that the way she has been acting around him isn’t truly how she is. It just sucks to see all these things come crashing down on you at once. I really don’t know what to do.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a small mental breakdown about a week ago and ever since then everything has seemed to be void of happiness. I’ve always been an introvert, but I do love being around people. It’s probably the one thing that really excites me. However, I’m  an empath so I base my emotions to match those around me so I can try and reason with them. I can smile hard for a picture but the second the shutter closes my face goes back to being emotionless.

I’ve always been a shy and calm person, never one to start any problems. Lately my depression has been getting worse and I don’t know how much longer I can take jt. I don’t really have anyone to talk to at all.\nI do have a girlfriend, I do have family, and I do have “friends” but they are not the type of people I’d go to for help. Every time I bring up my mental state to my girlfriend she shrugs it off and says I’m over exaggerating or thinking too much. I know she means no disrespect or anything but she just doesn’t understand me and I rather not bother her. And For the most part, my family and friends are just people I have love for but not really people I’d sit down and talk with one on one. \nI have a shitty job with shitty pay and live in a shitty neighborhood. My job makes my depression even worse. I work at subway not because I want to but because no other jobs wants to give me a chance.

Every shot I get at a potential new job I end up blowing it. Either too good to be true or I’m not the right fit. Subway makes me very very angry and fills me with rage because of how busy it is.

My only day off.

She works long hours and I don’t see her but she told me she sacrifices spending time with us be Ass I she wants us to have a good life and she has to work to make money. But when she’s not at work she’s with her new family of a guy who buys her what we she wants ans his two awfully spoiled kids. His solution to screaming at my sister for no reason was flowers and my mom forgave him. My mom constantly insults me (ex as soon as she comes home feom not seeing us for awhile or just feom work it’s never a oh you look nice, it’s usually telling me I smell or I look bad or my hairs a mess of why and I wearing that and I do all of this bc of my depression I can’t help if I hate seeing myself naked or in the mirror most of the time. I feel disgusting and stupid because of her and I want to die everyday because of the perpetual verbal abuse and mind games she plays she doesn’t even care if I’m okay mentally all that matters is I don’t “ruin it for every one” at dinner and “smile you look miserable” maybe it’s because I ducking am I hate my body and she did the same thing to my dad.

She works long hours and I don’t see her but she told me she sacrifices spending time with us be Ass I she wants us to have a good life and she has to work to make money. But when she’s not at work she’s with her new family of a guy who buys her what we she wants ans his two awfully spoiled kids.

I feel disgusting and stupid because of her and I want to die everyday because of the perpetual verbal abuse and mind games she plays she doesn’t even care if I’m okay mentally all that matters is I don’t “ruin it for every one” at dinner and “smile you look miserable” maybe it’s because I ducking am I hate my body and she did the same thing to my dad.

I am constantly trying to compensate for all of my guilt. It started in high school when my first relationship ended and I have been stuck in this cycle of guilt, to drug abuse and then more mistakes ever since.

She just kept going back to the difference between thoughts and actions, how we have control over our actions and that is what I need to focus on.

The entire time I’ve known you I’ve tried my hardest and I still make mistakes. I tell myself, “If she would accept me completely it would relieve all of my stress.

I still do trust you more than anyone else, but I’m constantly scared that I’m being lied to and I could be thrown away at any time. I know you have a lot going on and that I’m more than you can handle. But I really need a true friend that I can trust one hundred percent. Someone to do normal things with and make small moments of joy. Someone to talk both lightly and seriously with, without being scared of being judged. I don’t want to be an emotional burden, but I know that I am. If you can be a friend that I can trust completely I think it would help me start to be a better person. I know you would call me out when I am making mistakes, and I would like it if you could do that before I make them. I would like to be able to spend time with you, relax and have fun together.

I guess you could call it Illness Anxiety disorder. People constantly tell me to chill out, and to not worry. How am I not supposed to worry about my damn health when I have to live with it constantly, and how am I not supposed to worry about my damn health when it could have far reaching complications that could potentially change my life for the worse in the long term. \n\nSome background: \n\nI got into the Drugs scene in college in the first part of 2019. Primarily with psychedelia and marijuana. Being from an illegal state, it was all about being discrete and keeping your marijuana products as lowkey as possible. That being said, THC vape pens; primarily Dank Vapes, Kingpens, Brass Knuckles, GoHards, and pretty much every other black market brand out there was \"the thing to do\" amongst us college sophomores for our recreational time. Being an absolute health nut, I refused to get into the opioid or stimulant scene because of how detrimental it good be for both your physical and mental health, instead opting to do the other things because of good things I heard about it. \n\nI loved Marijuana vape products. Loved them so much that I would almost constantly use them every single of my life for a good 2-3 months, not really caring what was in them or the long term effects of them. As far as I was concerned, it got me high and made me feel good, so I could care less. And everyone was doing them, so what's the harm right, no one else is getting hurt. (should've paid more attention to the drug education during high school) \n\nFast forward to May. I was attempting to try as many marijuana cartridge black market brands as I could possibly do. Much to my shock there was a brand called GoHard Pest Free Clear Cartridges. I didn't know it at the time but something was incredibly off about this cartridge. It tasted like burnt plastic and made me extremely, if not uncomfortably high. I knew nothing or had completely forgotten about Spice/K2 and synthetic cannabinoids during this time period so it never really crossed my mind that this may have been a synthetic cannabinoid tank. Of course like a dumbass I smoked little more than half of it through daily usage. Even after I let my girlfriend try it, in which she vomited and went almost in a \"tripping\" state, I thought nothing of it, like maybe she was just a lightweight. Normal Cannabis Carts don't do that, now I know. \n\nOf course to augment my high and to satisfy my \"munchies,\" I would eat fried chicken and cup of noodles practically every single day. My health deteriorated as such and I didn't even notice it. My weight skyrocketed and my cognitive ability declined sharply. Tried DXM and combined with LSD once after that and my mind fell off a cliff. \n\nIn june I was admitted to the mental health hospital for delusions and nausea in addition to heavy visual snow. Every moment I had during the day I would constantly research diseases, medical conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, and genetic defects. On top of that, I wasn't suicidal but I couldn't stop dwelling about how nasty I felt. The Doctors in the Psychiatric ward pumped me full of antipsychotics, not limited to seroquel, olanzapine, abilify and so on. Nothing worked. Nothing at all. Cognitive ability continued to rapidly shift and I ended up an obsessive vegetable with extreme mental whiplash as to how I reached this point in my life. \n\nThankfully, In the the psychiatric hospital I was released under the condition that my parents would take me halfway across the country back home. Made it home without issue. Life from that point forward has been absolute hell. \n\nMy mental health has improved yes, but its been an uphill battle, and honestly it tires me out. Writing things like this are therapeutic because it reminds me of the journey that it took me to get to this point. \n\nOk back to my story. \n\nFast forward to home. I was forced to meet with a psychiatrist that prescribed me Zyprexa for my issues. Of course, not knowing any better, I thought this would be a one-stop solution that would suddenly fix all my obsessions. \n\nThe olanzapine did nothing more than cut down on my mental capacity and made me further dwell on the possibility that I had early onset dementia, something like brain cancer, or ALS. So after two months of a constant fight within my head, wrestling the issue, I determined that it wasn't for me, and it was only harming me. Once I discontinued it and switched to a regimen of antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and thankfully I began to see some progress. My mental capacity gradually improved, and my mindstate as well began to improve. \n\nIn the place of fear, and sadness came anger towards those psychiatrists and people who constantly pumped with medication. I continued my research on diseases on different neurodegenerative conditions in an attempt to use knowledge as an antipsychotic for my condition. \n\nFast forward to today, why am I writing this post? \n\nWell I am extremely concerned that those synthetic cannabinoids that I smoked are responsible for my issue and I cannot stop obsessing about it. It crosses my mind every single moment of the day that Synthetic cannabinoids, or a large amount of them are Genotoxic and Carcinogenic. I ask myself, what if the genotoxic compounds damaged my Neuronal DNA and what if as a result I well end up with a neurodegenerative disorder such frontotemporal lobe dementia or ALS or even Parkinsons? Obviously these substances bind to Cannabinoid receptors in the brain and its established through some well regarded research to be toxic to throat and lung cells, why wouldn't that same genotoxicity apply to neurons as well? and If so, doesn't that mean that I am fucked? \n\nEvery time I obsess above the stuff above, it sends me into an almost depressive state in which I really really want to end my life because I really don't want to find out, or rather I don't want to be in pain and don't want my family to deal with my shit if something like that actually happens. Then another part of me comes in and tells me that DNA and neurons have repair mechanisms or something like Neurons aren't affected by genotoxic compounds the same way that lung and throat cells are affected. But I really don't know. It's the unknown, and I'm not a qualified Geneticist, so I really can't say anything on the matter, which drives me mad, and ultimately makes me feel hopeless. **I'm obsessing about the possibilities and it's making me feel lifeless.** How would I even know that i'm affected by such disorders, how do I know that I didn't fuck myself over by willingly smoke genotoxic compounds. Lab results and MRIs don't show anything out of the ordinary and yet the worry still persists in my mind, making me sick and depressed. \n\nYes I know that's its my fault that I got into doing these substances in the first place and honestly it might just be karma that I'm getting hit with all these mental issues, but I never imagined just how horrible things would be. I'm not crazy, I'm not schizophrenic, I don't feel like I want to stab someone, I just want to know If I'm sick with a disease or not! The fact that people are willing to pump me with antipsychotics for just having questions is absolutely mental, I wish that there was a more effective way to screen the body for defects or things that could put at risk for certain diseases/neurodegenerative disorders. That is the only thing holding me back in life, and I keep getting two types of nightmares. One of them is that I do have a neurodegenerative disorder and I'll be dead in a couple of years, another of them is that I don't and I continue to obsess about them, ultimately ending up homeless. \n\nIt's been six months since my symptoms started and I feel as if I haven't gotten any worse. Visual snow is still there and I get occasionally nauseous. My parents think I have improved as well. The concern though persists, how do I really know that I'm safe and how do I live my life if that possibility is always there, even though i'm only 20? Genotoxicity is no fucking joke and it scares the fuck out of me. \n\nHere is the article I spent too much time reading on:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/) \n\nWill I spend the rest of my life worrying about the possibility of disease?

I continued my research on diseases on different neurodegenerative conditions in an attempt to use knowledge as an antipsychotic for my condition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, why am I writing this post? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well I am extremely concerned that those synthetic cannabinoids that I smoked are responsible for my issue and I cannot stop obsessing about it. It crosses my mind every single moment of the day that Synthetic cannabinoids, or a large amount of them are Genotoxic and Carcinogenic. I ask myself, what if the genotoxic compounds damaged my Neuronal DNA and what if as a result I well end up with a neurodegenerative disorder such frontotemporal lobe dementia or ALS or even Parkinsons? Obviously these substances bind to Cannabinoid receptors in the brain and its established through some well regarded research to be toxic to throat and lung cells, why wouldn&amp;#39;t that same genotoxicity apply to neurons as well? and If so, doesn&amp;#39;t that mean that I am fucked? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I obsess above the stuff above, it sends me into an almost depressive state in which I really really want to end my life because I really don&amp;#39;t want to find out, or rather I don&amp;#39;t want to be in pain and don&amp;#39;t want my family to deal with my shit if something like that actually happens. Then another part of me comes in and tells me that DNA and neurons have repair mechanisms or something like Neurons aren&amp;#39;t affected by genotoxic compounds the same way that lung and throat cells are affected. But I really don&amp;#39;t know. It&amp;#39;s the unknown, and I&amp;#39;m not a qualified Geneticist, so I really can&amp;#39;t say anything on the matter, which drives me mad, and ultimately makes me feel hopeless. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m obsessing about the possibilities and it&amp;#39;s making me feel lifeless.&lt;/strong&gt; How would I even know that i&amp;#39;m affected by such disorders, how do I know that I didn&amp;#39;t fuck myself over by willingly smoke genotoxic compounds. Lab results and MRIs don&amp;#39;t show anything out of the ordinary and yet the worry still persists in my mind, making me sick and depressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes I know that&amp;#39;s its my fault that I got into doing these substances in the first place and honestly it might just be karma that I&amp;#39;m getting hit with all these mental issues, but I never imagined just how horrible things would be. I&amp;#39;m not crazy, I&amp;#39;m not schizophrenic, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I want to stab someone, I just want to know If I&amp;#39;m sick with a disease or not! The fact that people are willing to pump me with antipsychotics for just having questions is absolutely mental, I wish that there was a more effective way to screen the body for defects or things that could put at risk for certain diseases/neurodegenerative disorders. That is the only thing holding me back in life, and I keep getting two types of nightmares. One of them is that I do have a neurodegenerative disorder and I&amp;#39;ll be dead in a couple of years, another of them is that I don&amp;#39;t and I continue to obsess about them, ultimately ending up homeless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been six months since my symptoms started and I feel as if I haven&amp;#39;t gotten any worse. Visual snow is still there and I get occasionally nauseous. My parents think I have improved as well. The concern though persists, how do I really know that I&amp;#39;m safe and how do I live my life if that possibility is always there, even though i&amp;#39;m only 20? Genotoxicity is no fucking joke and it scares the fuck out of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the article I spent too much time reading on:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/\"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5104816/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will I spend the rest of my life worrying about the possibility of disease? This is not how I want to live. I want to just know, and get on with my time here on this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ekojxt", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Bassomatic42", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ekojxt/im_obsessing_about_the_possibilities_and_its/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ekojxt/im_obsessing_about_the_possibilities_and_its/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578283659.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "I realized my insurance ive waited so long for doesnt cover mental health.

My life has always been relatively easy, with my only real challenge being Misophonia, which you can learn some about here: r/misophonia. It’s basically that certain commonplace noises provoke extreme stress in me. My parents lover and provide for me, and I’m on antidepressants, but as far as I can tell, there is nothing to help with my core problem. Life is meaningless and I will almost certainly never find any lasting joy. I play video games to distract me, but even then I bore of every game and have to move on after a while. I’ve never found anything I’m good at and have no idea how to spend the rest of life. I’m so bad at things that I’m 18 and have never even gotten close to enough to begin a relationship, I’ve had a few friends, but generally only one at a time, and am always one of their lowest priority friends. There is basically nothing that I look forward to, aside from the release of DOOM ETERNAL, but part of me knows that it will probably disappoint me. I know that I will never have a chance of finding a girlfriend, and if I do, it will only end in far more heartbreak than the death of my few friendships. The fact that everything is for naught, and that even if by some insane series of coincidences I find success or a lasting source of happiness it won’t matter or change anything. I haven’t learnt to drive because I’m too lazy, and have basically nowhere to go, because there is nowhere on the world where people seem to be happy. I haven’t worked a day in my life yet, partially because I know it would just be more pain. I’ve had. Flickers of happiness in the past, and sometimes when I am distracted, but they are fleeting and in no way equal to all the negatives I feel everyday. I can’t even escape this hell through killing my self, because as I found out years ago, it is impossible for me to go through with it. Is there anything I can do that might make life hurt less?

My life has always been relatively easy, with my only real challenge being Misophonia, which you can learn some about here: &lt;a href=\"/r/misophonia\"&gt;r/misophonia&lt;/a&gt;. It’s basically that certain commonplace noises provoke extreme stress in me. My parents lover and provide for me, and I’m on antidepressants, but as far as I can tell, there is nothing to help with my core problem. Life is meaningless and I will almost certainly never find any lasting joy. I play video games to distract me, but even then I bore of every game and have to move on after a while. I’ve never found anything I’m good at and have no idea how to spend the rest of life. I’m so bad at things that I’m 18 and have never even gotten close to enough to begin a relationship, I’ve had a few friends, but generally only one at a time, and am always one of their lowest priority friends. There is basically nothing that I look forward to, aside from the release of DOOM ETERNAL, but part of me knows that it will probably disappoint me. I know that I will never have a chance of finding a girlfriend, and if I do, it will only end in far more heartbreak than the death of my few friendships. The fact that everything is for naught, and that even if by some insane series of coincidences I find success or a lasting source of happiness it won’t matter or change anything. I haven’t learnt to drive because I’m too lazy, and have basically nowhere to go, because there is nowhere on the world where people seem to be happy. I haven’t worked a day in my life yet, partially because I know it would just be more pain. I’ve had. Flickers of happiness in the past, and sometimes when I am distracted, but they are fleeting and in no way equal to all the negatives I feel everyday. I can’t even escape this hell through killing my self, because as I found out years ago, it is impossible for me to go through with it. Is there anything I can do that might make life hurt less? As a final note, I do not believe in any sort of afterlife, and am 90% sure that once I can finally die, it will just be the sweet embrace of nothingness, like sleeping without having a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "eknu7h", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "A2ndFamine", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eknu7h/i_remembered_my_realizations_some_old_and_some/", "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eknu7h/i_remembered_my_realizations_some_old_and_some/", "subreddit_subscribers": 585802, "created_utc": 1578280098.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext": "My girlfriend has apparently been depressed since high school ish times and has been seeing a therapist for a bit.

Everything from hanging to pills, I’m still fucking alive for some reason.  So I’m going to tell everyone on this lovely subreddit about how I ended up like this.  It all started in 2017.  I’m a retarded 7th grader and life’s going okay.  Then I got my first girlfriend!  That was awesome.  Yeah yeah, stupid jr high shit and then we broke up.  This made me sad as fuck but it was nothing too bad.  So 8th grade and 2018 role around and life’s looking better.  I’m more of an asshole, and a cynic but life’s going alright still.  So then around the end of eighth grade I started dating this girl, I ended it only a couple weeks into the relationship because I just wasn’t into.  I spent the next couple weeks being harassed by her friends because I was a shitty person.  Yeah nothing I didn’t know.  THEN me and my best friend at the time ended up liking the same girl.  Nothing terrible, honestly not the worst thing in the world.  On the other hand how we went about dealing with the situation really fucked me up.  We decided for some reason that it was best to just wait it out and see who she would pick.  That was the worst fucking idea any of us could’ve had.  I wanted out of the situation but no the girl and my friend both roped me back into this shit and had me stay involved.  It was literal months of me just saying I give up go be with my friend, and eventually I just fucking snapped.  I might be a pussy for this but I just couldn’t fucking deal with it.  Long story short I get sent to a psych ward and shit I end up back out in the real world now seeing a therapist every week, and yeah yeah you get the picture.  Life starts to look up around here and I get into highschool.  Highschool is fucking awesome.  Greatest time I’ve had in my short life so far.  Honestly amazing.  I started dating a sophomore who was a bitch and who I really shouldn’t have been with from the start.  She cheated on me and blamed it on me for having mental health issues.  That was less fun.  Over the summer my grandmother died, my great uncle died, my other grandparents got into a car accident, and I tried long distance dating which didn’t work out.  I’m still trying long distance and hoping this time it works out.  Now I’m on meds and don’t give a shit.  I plan on joining the marines and dying by age 25 at most.

So then around the end of eighth grade I started dating this girl, I ended it only a couple weeks into the relationship because I just wasn’t into.  I spent the next couple weeks being harassed by her friends because I was a shitty person.  Yeah nothing I didn’t know.  THEN me and my best friend at the time ended up liking the same girl.  Nothing terrible, honestly not the worst thing in the world.  On the other hand how we went about dealing with the situation really fucked me up.  We decided for some reason that it was best to just wait it out and see who she would pick.  That was the worst fucking idea any of us could’ve had.  I wanted out of the situation but no the girl and my friend both roped me back into this shit and had me stay involved.  It was literal months of me just saying I give up go be with my friend, and eventually I just fucking snapped.  I might be a pussy for this but I just couldn’t fucking deal with it.  Long story short I get sent to a psych ward and shit I end up back out in the real world now seeing a therapist every week, and yeah yeah you get the picture.  Life starts to look up around here and I get into highschool.  Highschool is fucking awesome.  Greatest time I’ve had in my short life so far.  Honestly amazing.  I started dating a sophomore who was a bitch and who I really shouldn’t have been with from the start.  She cheated on me and blamed it on me for having mental health issues.  That was less fun.  Over the summer my grandmother died, my great uncle died, my other grandparents got into a car accident, and I tried long distance dating which didn’t work out.  I’m still trying long distance and hoping this time it works out.  Now I’m on meds and don’t give a shit.  I plan on joining the marines and dying by age 25 at most.
