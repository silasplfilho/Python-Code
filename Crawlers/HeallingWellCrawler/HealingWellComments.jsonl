The low motivation is stealing my time away. Winter snow and cold and gloomy days make me want to couch a whole lot more, but not in a depressed way, just a lazy way. I never seem to get my to do list done,but -  I don't imagine anyone who lives alone with in an older home and older vehicles never gets every thing completely done (?). Always one repair or maintenance item after another. In the summer Im a very active person, but certainly not the energizer bunny, I go in spurts till I get tired and take a nap after work. I get burned out very easy. Being introverted makes tired around people too (from work), nothing I can fix there. And lyme disease changes the body to some extent sometimes forever. 90% healed is what most end up with. I dont drink or use any rec drugs legal or not. So, thats my intro, I might have posted here a long time ago, dont remember. ****Can these light help with motivation? Or are they only effective for the severely depressed? ***I know lack of light turns on the meitonine sleep hormone. Im in very northern US, less daylight and cloudy when it is day.

Not sure what to say now I'm here. I left, because I felt like I was boring everyone, including myself, with my long, dreary, rambling posts. The depression came back and I had nothing to say that anyone wanted to hear, in real life or online. I felt like a ghost, literally: moving unseen through a world where I had no place. My social anxiety and panic attacks increased and even leaving my flat to walk to the supermarket or town centre became another form of torture. I guess you heard about the election in the UK? From my point of view it was the worst result imaginable. We'll get our hard, patriotic Brexit. Our democratic institutions, judiciary, etc. will be hollowed out. The long term project of privatising the NHS will continue apace but in private of course, so the plebs don't cotton on until it's too late to backtrack. Etc. etc. The only silver lining for me is that I don't care anymore. I could not feel less a part of this country if I tried to. I may as well be an alien.My Crohn's is also depressing me at the moment. Thinking of returning to a permanent ileostomy while we still have an NHS, but that comes with its own set of worries and issues. It's not a panacea, otherwise I would book the operation tomorrow. Okay, I took a short break because I couldn't decide whether to post this as it is or try to inject a note of optimism to dilute the relentless bleakness. I'm lazy so relentless bleakness it is. But, ironically enough, I now feel slightly better for the short break, so I do feel more capable of injecting a note of extremely tentative and wary optimism. A few weeks ago, I was all ready to give into the depression in the most final way (I woudn't have done, but only because of my mum). Now, I'm teetering on the edge between wanting to give in and wanting to find a pathway out of the seemingly endless forest of depression. Take care, folks. Look after yourselves as best you can.

You are actually lucky you've lived a large portion of your life with the social services you have. Imagine you lived here? I know that's not the point, but it's our reality. Hopefully, things change for the better at some point soon. Isn't what you fear basically how we live here? Sometimes I get down about it, and then I realize that I have at least prevented it from happening to someone else by not having children, and I am getting old, perhaps politically things can't get too much worse in my lifetime? One thing I know is that waiting for things to get better usually leads to nothing. You have to go out and work hard to improve your situation.

I actually had a really nice Christmas Eve, the best I've had in years I think. The dinner was simple but lovely (crusty bread, smoked salmon, prawns, ham, plus a marie rose sauce I made for the prawns - marie rose sauce can be a tad bland, so I gave it a kick up the arse with brandy and tabasco sauce). Then I caught up on the BBC's 3-part adaption of A Christmas Carol and we watched the last part together, followed by a half hour ghost story afterwards. I had two massive glasses of eggnog, along with several Lindt chocolates. The bad news? My other brother, who I don't like and don't get along with, is coming tomorrow with his family. It'll be infinitely more boring, hearing their boring conversation and being left out, as I always was when I was a child. My brother is the sort of dullard bore who has zero imagination and empathy and I would be quite happy if I never saw him again. Already feeling stressed out at the thought of spending 3-4 hours sitting around that dull table, eating the dull turkey, and listening to the dull conversation - nobody even plays any board or card games! (My mum doesn't like them). Perhaps I will leave the table before my nephews do, so I at least get first dibs at the TV in my mum's bedroom. Otherwise they'll take over it for the whole evening. There you go. That's my Christmas Day rant 24 hours early.... >.> @nssg - I don't want to get too political, but we are leaving the EU in order to become like America. You say I'm lucky and, yes, I have been so far. But I'm not getting any younger or healthier and, unlike you, an operation never cured my IBD. Last night I got up about 6x to go to the toilet. That's crazy and I can't carry on like that. This is easily as bad as it was pre-surgery; the only difference is I don't get fevers anymore or only rarely. I live in fear of the future. We are, at least regards welfare, already like you: austerity has been brutal to millions and we now have more foodbanks in the UK than McDonald's and Burger Kings combined. (Before the Tories, I think we had about two.) I am well aware of my relative good luck so far, but I do not expect it to hold out for another 40-50 years.  And as long as my parents are still alive, I will always have a home to go back to, but my mum is 80 and my dad is 84: they are hardly spring chickens. I don't see things improving in the UK in my lifetime for reasons I won't bore you with. Nobody would be happier than me to be wrong, but the path we have chosen to go down is not one that can easily be rescinded.  Once the NHS has gone that's it for example. No government will bring it back again, it was a creation of its time (post-war). I know I ought to work, but I'm 44, haven't worked for 20 years, have serious mental health problems and autism, along with various physical issues. It's not like there's any support from anywhere. My parents don't have a clue how to help me and I can't blame them, because I don't have a clue how to help myself. I could try to gain a qualification if it's not too expensive, but I have no idea what employers want, what skills are useful, what are a waste of time. I was thinking of IT, but IT is an incredibly broad subject. And would anyone really hire a nearly 50 year old with no work experience? I don't know. Anyway, I'm getting all depressing and dour again, so I'll shut up :-/Just to say, I'm sorry you have to work, because it's obvious you don't enjoy it one little bit. And I can't say I blame you.

Have you have the opportunity to try that? As for your mom's house today, that sounds frustrating. At the same time, I usually let the kids do what they want. How many kids is it?

The only problem with a cat is that they can be quite destructive and they don't \"get you out of the house\". Dogs require a lot of walks and you can take them to the dog park. it's more social. Are you definitely getting a dog? A small one? I drive my dogs to go walking. it's very chaotic where I live. A lot people in the city area also don't curb and you will end up with poop on your shoe, or on the dog's feet, which is unhealthy for everyone involved. I don't mind driving to the park where it's clean to walk. As for work, I don't know about whether you're going to get hired at your first corporate job, or start a career, at nearing 50  (though it's not impossible), but there are tons of regular jobs that hire all sorts of people. If you get a skill that's in demand, even if it's a relatively simple certification, I am sure you would get hired. I see people doing all sorts of assistant jobs with relatively no experience or specified education. You're smart too, you would be easy to train.

I call it IBD but the vet doesn't seem all that interested in actually diagnosing and treating it, they just want to do tests and never give long-term treatment or diagnosis.

Go here and see if there's a dermatologist near you https://www.acvd.org/It's a tough cycle, skin issue, drugs, D. At least if you can manage the skin issue without antibiotics, maybe you can get the D to let up. Have you tried pumpkin? or tylosin can help... Did you do stool tests?

This will be a fairly quick update, as it's late and I didn't get any sleep last night. I thought I had posted about Christmas Day already, but I hadn't. Long story short: It went okay >_>. I did go a bit mental with the Lyrica (think that's its brand name) and codeine (I took 2 pills of each), which perhaps helped explain why. The pills also helped a lot with my Crohn's, which was an unexpected relief. Unfortunately I'm back to normal now, as there is no way my GP will prescribe me that much codeine or Lyrica, or indeed either at all. Anyway, the day went well. Dinner was nice and even my family didn't irritate 7 bells of hell out of me. Boxing Day was quiet, just watched a couple of films with my mum and brother. Why are ghost stories so bad nowadays? We watched a ghost story which trotted out every single cliche of the genre at least 30 times each, because it's bound to be even scarier on the 30th go, m i rite? On the 27th I went with my mum and my brother to my aunt's house. It started off loud and ascended to ear-splitting, as more people arrived. There was music, but it was not the music: no music could drown out this lot. They are the loudest people known to man. There is no conversation that they can't bellow out at top volume. Everyone in that house is also a fanatical Brexiter and I think I heard every Brexit cliche that night too. Fortunately I'd had enough alcohol by then to mellow me a bit. It's a weird situation because my aunt has been quite kind to me, but I do feel like I'm living on a different planet to my family (excluding my mum and brother) - I just have nothing in common with any of them. On the 28th the Christmas excesses finally caught up with me and I had a day of feeling wretched. I even had a fever, probably Crohn's-related. Used to get them all the time, but since surgery that's the one symptom I rarely have anymore. It's just everything else which is awful.Oh yeah, also saw my GP for the first time in a year! (Don't ask me why, otherwise I will go into a long and bitter spiel about the not-fit-for-purpose appointments system and it's too late for that.) She is really good though, I have to say. I got my blood test results back and found out I have anaemia and elevated TSH. Need an iron infusion and my levothyroxine has been increased to 125mcg. I also asked about a little-known antidepressant called Valdoxan - I don't think it is available in the US, but it did sound quite promising when I googled it. I think my GP would have prescribed it to me if she could, but apparently GPs are not allowed to prescribe it, so I'll have to get in touch with the mental health team at my local mental health centre. I hope I do not see the same useless, patronising doctor that I saw last time, as I did not like her. Phew. That's about it. Didn't do much yesterday apart from wreck my foot. Oh yes. Forgot about that one  I banged my foot into a table leg by accident. It was excruciatingly painful for a minute or two, then I laid down on the sofa and forgot about it. Didn't notice it again until I had to dash to the toilet... It didn't look that bad, but it was *really* painful to walk on. I worried I might have a fracture instead of a sprain. But today, it was easier to walk around the flat. Yay! Then I put on my shoes to walk to the supermarket, which is literally a 5 minute walk if that. I had to turn back halfway, it was that painful - even undoing the laces didn't do anything. Nooo! I'm meant to be going out with my mum and brother tomorrow. Even driving will be difficult, judging by this. But by hook or crook I'm going, even if I have to dose up with painkillers and wear sandals and look like a weirdo in January. Really don't want to spend another day doing nothing in my flat. Anyway, that's my update. Super exciting isn't it? <_<. I want to go to bed now, which doesn't leave me any time to answer your questions and this post is probably already long enough, really. But I would like to say something before I go. @Karen - Your dog sounds stressed. She is both young and a German Shepherd and German Shepherds are a high energy breed. I am not saying it would solve every problem she has, but I do think exercise would almost certainly help. I know it is hard for you to get out, but would you consider hiring a dog walker to walk her? Is there anywhere she can run around, like a field or a park? Does she have toys to play with at home, bones to chew? Sorry for all the questions; I'm just trying to help you help her feel better. Okay, I'd better go now. I'll let you know how tomorrow and my foot went :p Goodnight, everyone.", "commentTimestamp": "12/30/2019 6:16 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "ForeverPositive", "comment": "Hi NCOT,I'm glad to hear that your Christmas went okay.

I suffered from it on-and-off throughout the years. My doctor told me to take an iron tablet with orange juice for better absorption. I am also taking blackstrap molasses which supposedly increase your iron level.

I would love to have at least one day go by without anyone mentioning Trump as I am tired of hearing about him.

My cousin and her family live Birmingham, but recently came to the states for a visit. She is scared and very  worried about what is happening. She is  particularly nervous about the effects Brexit may have on getting medical supplies; she needs to take certain medications and is afraid that she may not be able to receive it.

Good to see you. I truly don't think I would care if I never saw Christmas again. It doesn't help that the buildup begins insanely early now, I swear much earlier than it did when I was a child. No sooner than Halloween is over, supermarkets are putting Christmas food on the shelves. The Christmas lights are switched on in mid November (the 17th in my town). The dreadful Christmas songs begins playing everywhere from mid to late November onwards. (It also peeves me that nobody plays carols anymore.) By the time mid December arrives, I'm just burnt out on all this stuff, as it feels like it's been going on for weeks already. Has been going on for weeks. And now I'm wondering if it is like this in America. Do you guys carry on like this or do you start your preparations later? Re anaemia. I never used to suffer from it - that's yet more collateral damage from the Crohn's. I could never tolerate oral iron in the past, not even the so-called gentle formulations. But oral iron tends to be poorly absorbed in IBD folks anyway. And in my case I don't seem to absorb it at all. I get an iron infusion and all my iron stores are gone in a few months. My haemoglobin is 10 at the moment, but in the past it has been 7 and once it was so low I had a blood infusion (I felt better straight away - it was like an infusion of pure energy).I am so sorry about your cousin from Birmingham - millions of us are in the same boat. Brexiters, of course, are in complete denial, but I've been worried about this for two years. I was *particularly* worried about my eyes, because without treatment the uveitis will cause irreversible damage which eventually will cause sight loss. And my uveitis has become chronic, so I need to take a daily dose of Maxidex. But I was lucky in one way: Maxidex is available OTC in Spain. So I asked my Brexit-voting, Spanish-residing aunt if she could bring me back some Maxidex and Levothyroxine from Spain, which fortunately she could (this is the same aunt whose house I went to a few days ago).By the way, the same aunt rushed off to get an Irish passport after she voted leave in the referendum. And every rich Brexiter supporter/campaigner is securing EU membership for themselves and their families on the quiet, although they can't keep it completely secret, otherwise I wouldn't know about it. Anyway, depending on what meds your cousin takes, she should look into seeing if she can get them from Spain or another EU country without a prescription. That won't be possible for most meds, obviously. But if she's got hypothyroidism, levothyroxine is one med you can get without a prescription. The transition period should last until December 2020 and I think Johnson will stick to it. He's lazy and doesn't want, I think, no deal chaos. (On the other hand, with his majority there is nothing to stop him from crashing out now, tbh.)Karen - Poor Luna! In a few years her need for exercise and to run about for hours should be less, but in the meantime I think behaviours like chasing her own tail stem from not having enough to do or being able to run around and burn off some of her nervous energy. Some breeds are not as high energy and are more apathetic (which includes many of the larger dogs), which would have been more suitable to you I think... :-/ I've no idea how scientific this list is. Not very I imagine, but I used to know a great dane and a bull mastiff. The great dane was placid and easy-going, whilst the bull mastiff never got up off the floor as far as I could tell: https://terriblyterrier.com/laziest-dog-breeds/*sees time* Oh crap.

My aunt and uncle had a young male Boxer that they couldn't handle. They'd had Boxers before, two of them, a mum and a daughter, but they were younger then and in better health. I loved their dog, he was a sweetheart. But he needed more exercise and discipline than they could give him (he pulled my aunt over onto the ground once when she was walking him on the leash). Anyway, sadly my uncle died not long afterwards. My aunt decided she couldn't look after the dog on her own and took him to Boxer Rescue. He was rehomed and apparently he was very happy with his new home and owner. He was able to run about in fields, something that he couldn't do in a surburban bungalow with a small, neat garden. What I'm trying to say is, you don't have to keep a dog if it is not right for either you or the dog :/ A dog as beautiful as Luna (you showed us a pic of her once) would deffo find a new home quickly, so I don't think you would need worry about her languishing in a dog home for years.

I know that you would never be cruel to Luna in a million years, I am just concerned she is unintentionally suffering. That's why a couple of posts back I mentioned the possibility of getting a dog walker... They are fairly common where I am. If I lived near you I would take Luna out myself D: If it made no difference, then no harm has been done. But an hour of walking (preferably running around if you have a park, wood, etc. where dogs can freely run near you) would burn off some of that excess energy and calm her down a bit, I suspect. I remember our old Jack Russell terrier when he was young: he could chase a football for hours and not tire or get bored of it :/ If the chewing started when the heat began, I'm wondering if it's too hot for Luna, as she has that really thick coat. And dogs in general are more sensitive to the heat than humans are (they have a higher body temperature, plus a coat of fur that we lack). Could you turn the heat down without making yourself cold? Or give Luna an unheated room? (Sorta offtopic, but heating is so expensive I only heat one room at a time anyway. Electricity prices are insane in this country. Sorry. That deffo was offtopic.)

The reason was because I didn't think I had any irrational beliefs.But man was I wrong!  As soon as I started seeing a shrink, I quickly found out that I had a lot of irrational beliefs.When I went into therapy, I learned that I couldn't help the world as much as I thought I could at the time.  I also found out that it's better to be assertive with rude people than to be aggressive or passive.So if you're thinking of seeing a counselor who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the first time, you must realize that you likely do have at least some irrational beliefs.  And a good CBT therapist can help you replace unhealthy, irrational beliefs with more healthy, rational beliefs over time.Post Edited (MainerMikeBrown) : 1/6/2020 6:24:08 PM (GMT-7)", "commentTimestamp": "1/6/2020 6:07 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "BnotAfraid", "comment": "Thanks for posting Mike, all true.PeaceTrina", "commentTimestamp": "1/7/2020 10:33 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "theHTreturns...", "comment": "Best not see a therapist who specializes in cbt!!!

My Mom used to buy cold cuts and rolls for Christmas so we could make our own sandwiches whenever we wanted to eat.  Same principle I guess.Lisa and her Mom will be coming down today so we can all go out to lunch.  In the past, I'd go up to them and we'd go out to dinner and I'd stay over but, now that I live alone there is no-one to care for the dogs (pit bulls, so no-one else is willing and I can't blame them).

Otherwise, they'll be barking their heads off!No 'resolutions' for me.  Why set myself up for failure? ha ha!  So much has changed already, and I know more changes are coming as it is!Going for a second opinion with an oral surgeon today.  I know the torus must be removed from the upper palate before I can have dentures made but...the first surgeon said he can only do local anesthesia and I cannot imagine someone using a hammer and chisel and a grinder on the roof of my mouth with me wide awake and fully aware!  So, this consultation is more about knocking me out for the procedure than it is about alternatives to removal per se.I'm also hoping this one will say the upper teeth can be removed at the same time.  One molar has been getting infected and the canine on the other side is loose and constantly painful.  I'd rather not leave them until the torus site is healed, at least another month!I'll be stocking up on soft foods and liquid meal replacements ahead of having the procedures.  I'll probably get some Benefiber or Fibercon, too as I don't think liquids will make me feel full and I don't want issues 'down below' either!Being toothless will be temporary, I know.  Still, I'm trying to prepare my ego for the blow.  I need this dentist to understand that I want to see MY smile...not someone else's idea of what my new teeth should look like.

Tomorrow we are going to dismantle it.  I am almost afraid of what we might find behind it - the space is big enough for a cat or a small child to get into but I haven't looked back there in years.  I have been sleeping in number 2 son's bed which is very uncomfortable which is why I am still up.

I’m deteoriating", "views": "1768 views", "link": "/community/default.aspx?f=19&m=4009094", "postContent": [{"commentAuthor": "Lavender Blood", "comment": "Hello, I am Dalia. I have severe anxiety, manic depression, and lack the ability to socialise in a normal way due to the isolative nature of my family.Growing up, I was abused physically by both of my parents and was taught that it was because I was a bad child. Although I acted up, I don’t think I was ever ridiculously wild or a handful, I often had people tell my family that I was polite and very friendly. The frequent and often brutal abuse inevitably took a toll. As I grew, I began to become reliant on affection of any kind at all, I craved love without pain. This led to me becoming unnaturally promiscuous and attempting to speak to grown men when I was barely 11 years old, I was desperate and lonely. My parents found out after looking through my phone, and I’m glad they stopped me but the way they handled it wasn’t beneficial. I was told I was filthy, called names that I don’t wish to repeat, I was hurting inside and I needed them to just love me. That much was clear, but they ignored the obvious signs of desperation for love. Not only did I have issues regarding affection, but severe trauma and self loathing after multiple accidents regarding small animals. I have NEVER intentionally hurt an animal with the motive to cause pain. I have lightly pushed puppies away when they bit me but never hurt them. There are repeated incidents in my life where an animal has died in my care, which I know some of you are judging me for. But just to elaborate, I never asked personally for these animals, because I knew that I wasn’t mature enough to care for them. My mother would get animals and when she got tired of them would pass them on to me.Unbeknownst to me, these animals often had health problems and were very sickly (1 rabbit and 1 ferret). And I would wake up or come home from school to discover them dead. In the haze of confusion, my father would mentally destroy me. I was a “murderer” and i was always going to “kill everything”. The worst trauma was when I was about 10. I had come home to my sickly ferret (Tico) laying in her cage and not moving. I cried and told my father, and in his response, he beat me with a belt and forced me to pick up her body and hold it. After I refused, he choked me and shoved my face near her body.I have always been very frightened of corpses of any kind, it traumatised me greatly. And to this day I still hate myself for what happened. Often using it as a reason to justify to myself why I should kill myself.The moments of trauma have changed me, and my psyche is altered. Last October, I was raped, by a friend I trusted and who promised me he wouldn’t do anything to me because he had a girlfriend. I was so frightened to tell my parents, because they would have accused me of “leading him on”.Since that incident, I have been more self destructive and nonchalant. I have goaded my father to beat me, I have ran away from home, I have done drugs and alcohol, I have snuck out of the house and fooled around with many many people and started self harming. As bizarre as it seems, sleeping with people makes me feel loved, something I NEVER felt before without pain. I know I’m ruining myself.I snuck a male into the house a little over a month ago, because I was sick and tired of being controlled (I wasn’t permitted to go out often) and I felt like he loved me. I was very stupid and ignorant, and slept with him while my mother was upstairs. She caught us in the act and rang my father, and he proceeded to ring the police. I am 15, he is 16. Whilst I understand that it isn’t necessarily legal, it isn’t uncommon for people here to do it at a young age. I accepted it and took my punishment, it was understandably a very stupid and disgraceful thing to do. It wasn’t the police that bothered me, it wasn’t that they hit me all the time...it was how disgustingly and coldly they spoke to me. They didn’t ask why I did it, they didn’t ask if it was because something happened, they didn’t ask any of that.They called me a prostitute and other names of that nature. And it broke me, horribly. They are all I have and they made me feel dirty, less than human. I began getting upset and thought of suicide, and they continued the verbal and physical abuse. But then they began to say I was mentally ill, that I was sick and deserved to be locked up. They said they wished they never had me and that they want me in an asylum.I have accepted that I have a mental illness, but they didn’t support me at all. I snapped shortly after I can’t do this anymore, I am alone and feel less than worth even so much as a kind word. I’m getting worse. Last night I snuck out of the house to go for a quiet walk by myself (they had been isolating me and kept me inside the house without any form of outside interaction for just nearing 2 months) and when I came in, I was met with a cocktail of degrading insults and a blow to the head. They also made me a promise to get me an appointment with a councillor so I can open up to someone (a promise they have been putting off for a long time. I can only assume it is to protect themselves from getting exposed.) I just want help, advice and a friend to speak to. I’m so horribly lonely and I want interaction so badly. It’s getting worse.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 5/1/2018 1:33:55 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "5/1/2018 12:03 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "HI Lavender Blood...Welcome to the depression forum.

My mom was widowed at young age with 2 teenagers and 2 small kids with no career. She couldn't handle it. She beat us a lot when we were kids. I usually stayed quiet so less would happen to me, which resulted in my ineffectiveness of standing up to basically anyone and everyone. I got through it because I knew that it was the only parenting she saw in her childhood. Sometimes, history repeats itself through generations over and over again. Someone told me once that \"Just because someone wants kids doesn't mean that they will be good parents.\" He referred to having kids as something everyone did. If you wanted them or not, it seemed irrelevent because that was the status quo. I'm not saying that your parents in particular didn't want kids, but it sounds like they both were messed up somehow before you ever came along. I'm not condoning their abuse, because they are jerks plain and simple.Sex does not ensure closeness with another person. You have to find something that makes you happy like a hobby. Art is very therapeutic for the psyche. You do have to find a therapist though. Start with a school guidance counselor, or find a clergyman, they can point you in the right direction. You make no money so, you can get free therapy somewhere that has a sliding scale. If the therapist asks you questions like \"why do you think everyone is out to get you?\" Don't go back to that one. Find another that you don't feel scrutized by.I hope you the best,s2bs", "commentTimestamp": "1/6/2020 9:51 PM (GMT -7)"}]}]

I'm much more myself without that med and recognise when I'm manic or diving. I have a well-stocked tool kit to help me.Right now - especially this time of year - I'm very depressed. Since 2013, I've lost 2 older siblings and a parent so christmas has been tough - not that it was any great shakes growing up - but this is more difficult. Work has been very trying. I work 12 hr shifts in support of a 24/7/365 Data Centre and we've been understaffed by 10 since Jan 2019. This has equated to me working over 430 hrs overtime since. It's burning me out, so I know that's part of the issue but I'm also within 3 years of retirement and been renting a house for the past 6+ years. I always figured I'd stay here till then and move to my bush property at retirement. Last month my landlord gave me til Mar 1 to move. It was simply because he and his wife want to sell and it is their house, after all.Now I need over 4000$ for first and last wherever I go. That means I can't turn down the over time as I had planned. I have 3 engine projects I needed to complete in the garage this winter - now I can't so my move to the bush is delayed further. Of course I have all the regular head aches happening - truck needs tranny work, trailer needs a rebuild, assorted tools need repair.......but I have to start sorting through 6 years of home life and decide what goes and what stays, knowing I'll end up with the bare essentials. I can't afford to move really - I just manage my current rent and it's not increased in 6 yrs - but have no choice.

In know way and I assuming anyone does not know this information,  I am sharing just in case, there is someone that is new to depression and the struggles and emotions it brings. Anger, has Hurt hiding behind it. If a person can do calm breathing, perhaps do a body scan, they can find the the emotions behind the anger.  Journaling can help bring out the emotions also.  Some prompts would be:What am I anger about?I can I do anything about my anger?How long have I been angry?Just write, don't worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation etc.  This is just for you.  No one else has to read it.  Keep going,  write what ever comes into your head. Leave it.   Come back in 4hrs or more,  maybe the next day, read it.

Unresponsible people anger me.  I had years of abuse from my family during childhood.  2011, suppressed memories popped.What I have learned in therapy are the following, I hope some of it helps you.  None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.

I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on.

Was up at 4:18 am, thanks to the dogs.  My laundry was done before 9 a.m.!  Then, I dressed and went to the hardware store, got my paint, came home and got busy.  Primed the ceiling, painted the ceiling, filled the holes in the walls, painted one coat on the walls.  Tomorrow I'll get the second coat on the walls and when they're dry, I'll start moving the furniture that I can manage by myself into there.  I chose a very, very light lavender since the room is rather dark with only the one window.I have 2 tall, metal shelving units, a desk and chair, three Sterlite (plastic) dressers, a china cabinet and a shoe rack to get moved!

So here’s my story... I was on Pristiq for about 10 years and it was working quite well.  I’ve also been sick with Lyme disease and coinfections which cause depression and anxiety and pain.  In February my Dr decided to switch me to Cymbalta, that it might help more with pain.  I wasn’t too happy to change since pristiq was still working.  Cymbalta ended up causing gut problems and I ended up becoming sensitive to all grains and could only eat protein and veggies.  After the summer we switched back to Pristiq 50mg.  Month went by and I just was feeling terrible with lots of anxiety. Oh, also, in the past few months my hubby was diagnosed Bipolar and has been manic for over a year which has been extremely stressful.  about 3 weeks ago my dose was raised to 100mg.  Still not feeling any better but know it could take 4+ weeks to kick in.  My Dr. added Wellbutrin 150 to help Pristiq work better.I’m on my 2nd day of Wellbutrin and anxiety got better with 1st dose.  My biggest side effect is increased pain.  This is a problem bc I’m already on prescription pain meds for widespread pain and now my pain is not controlled.  I’m wondering if any of you had increased pain when starting Wellbutrin and did it go away after a few weeks?  I fight hard every day to control the pain and really don’t want to have pain 24 hours a day.

I just go through the motions for my daughter and try to keep it together to do functions of the day- make dinner, do laundry, make sure stuff gets done, etc. Sometimes all I want to do is disappear. I know my daughter needs me and her life is better with me. I won’t do anything to hurt myself. Let’s get that straight.

Back in the 90's I was on a local branch board. The closest CH, closed down this past summer.   The other two are an hour away.   My therapist hosts a mens group ever Wed night at the one, on the other side of center city. This would make the idea easier to set up.  Will not happen over night of course.

I know that's not what the song is really about but we can take what we need from it, right? So interesting that you start to feel better when you smile and laugh. How long does the feeling last?Buena - flipping the switch- I like it, very visual and almost automated. When you switch off do you immediately go back to depression or is it more of feeling you can be yourself again? That is horrible about your evaluation- sounds very unfair. Sorry to hear that.

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.

Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.

That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.

We all would do things and think things out differently if we could turn back the clock.People who tell you they \"would not change a thing\" are not being truthful.  There are always regrets over lost opportunities, lost loves, lost friends and any number of situations.  In my case I have lost close friends for reasons I can't explain.  This  in particular has happened  with what I considered 3 times in my life.  In each case these people are still alive although they live in different areas of the country.  The fact that they have all had great financial success  must be a factor.  Monetary wealth seems to cause a breakdown in shared interests and the ability to share experiences.  Although I am not poor and struggling, I don't regret being lower on the social scene.With the group therapy exercise I am presently involved in, the other people who suffer with depression also have very diverse backgrounds and an endless stream of problems, both real and perceived.  Lives that have been shattered by deaths, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and other mental problems.I don't know your personal present situation.  I hope you have someone close.  My wife is my savior.  She has learned to understand depression and how to react to my occasional outbursts of tears and depressed thoughts.  I don't profess to be religious, but I envy those who find all the answers through total dedication to a supreme being.That's enough rambling on for now.

The person has a very complicated life, and some emotions became too much to deal with and required an early exit from our meeting.

This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.

Well it went about the way I expected.  There were various conclusions as you would expect.

Before each get together we would greet each other with \"how was your week?\".  In general the responses were some good days and some bad.With the exception of one or two people who did not enjoy the efforts of our moderator, the exercise was deemed a success.  We had all filled out a list of answers to general questions in our first meeting.  We answered the same questions at the last and checked to see if our outlook had changed over the 10 week period.  There had been someimprovements.The next step is to have a one on one meeting with the therapist to document and evaluate our experience andget some feedback  in order help us to work on things more specifically as individuals.I should mention that there was an incident which happened during the meeting. A person in an connecting roomwas screaming loudly and had to be removed by security.  This had an effect on our group, as it was of course frightening.

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.

There seems to be a stigma associated with not being married or having kids, particularly when you get into middle age.

All those experiences are foreign to me, and all I can do is nod politely as they happily and proudly talk about their daughter's piano talent, son's vacation escapades, getting into some great college, etc.There's definitely been pressure from family, even if not in so many words. They seem to have stopped asking about my relationships/wife only recently, perhaps realizing it likely won't happen. I have no siblings with children, and the family line will die off with me. This may be the biggest part of the pressure, which may have gotten to me -- i.e., I was made to feel as though I'm letting them down, and in the worst way possible.Not really sure how to get past this -- some people emphasize how they couldn't imagine life without their SO, how their kids are their reason for living, etc. For those without, what else can substitute?Not that I was ever against marriage, kids, and the \"normal\" or \"expected\" life, but I simply never found anyone, or maybe something about me always ruined things. Many years ago, I was even on an \"incel\" forum, long before incel became a four-letter word. I never found solutions, even if I found others in the same situation.

It's totally uncalled for.  As mentioned, it's none of his business what you do in your life.Some people are plain \"idiots\".  They like bullying people to make themselves feel better and bigger.  They especially like to bother the kind and quiet people.  Perhaps he is having home or other problems and taking his frustrations out on other people.  Maybe he's jealous of you for some reason.  I'm guessing, he was like this in school.There are millions of people who are unmarried without kids who are quite happy with their lives.  Others, who can't find their soulmate.  Even some who marry their soulmates get divorced.   I've read that a lot of the Millennials have no desire to get married after seeing so many other people getting divorced, including parents and aunts/uncles.  Some want to dedicate their lives to their jobs, some hoping they will build up their finances, so they can enjoy their retirement of traveling, etc.Maybe you should look for one or two of his weak spots.  Then when he bugs you again, you could throw that in his face.  Of course, that would be a last resort, especially if you think he is a better fighter. My Hubby mentioned that one because he was bullied in school and at work a few times, since he was only 126 lbs. during those times.  Then he took martial arts classes and built his muscles up since he figured something was going to come up again at some point.  Sure enough it did several times and he dealt with it both physically twice and verbally.  He made a fool out of the other guys.  My Hubby is a kind, smart but quiet Guy(he's not quiet with me   ).  No one better push his button or he'll figure out a way to put the abuser out.Of course, going to HR with your complaint would be the first choice since bullying is supposed to be 0 tolerance at school and work.  If a person is being harrassed then neither party is able to do their job properly.Do you get councelling or a therapist?

Before she left at the last session the therapist asked her to try one thing and to text him in 3 months to let him know how she was.  She agreed to this.The one thing was, to get a book, journal, anything, composition book,  and write to her children,  she could even have 2 separate books for each child.  She decided on 1 because they had a good relationship.  She said it was hard at first,  anger came out, grief was hard, crying as she wrote.  However, this was cathartic and she arrived at a place where she started to share here feelings with them.  Her love, memories, hopes and dreams that would not come to be.And late in the third month, she was writing to them everyday, letting them now, what the family and her were doing.When she talked to her therapist she agreed to see him once a month.  within 2 years she was writing only occasionally.  She realized that unconsciously she was letting go.  She then had therapy on an on call basis.

I didnt believe in therapy and figured there was noone out there that can relate to me so when I first started going I turned deaf ears on my therapist and we actually sat there for 5 sessions and barely said anything because I refused to talk... she said something's to me then that while in the moment i could have cared less but over time i started thinking about what she was telling me and now we are talking to each other and i actually listen to what she says...sometimes i still dont get everything she says but it doesnt mean it doesnt help. So i guess to answer the actual question... even if it doesnt seem to help immediately it doesnt mean that it doesnt help in the end..now if a person is going to commit suicide they will find a way and do it no matter what but that one sentance may...just may be what saves that person's life down the road. So remember...you dont know what the next person is dealing with...be kind to others as you never know...that act of kindness may just be the reason that person doesnt kill him/herself or someone else. We all struggle with stuff but you never know what can help someone else.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 10/16/2019 4:19:39 AM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "10/15/2019 5:28 PM (GMT -7)"}]}]

It's great that you are taking steps on your journey towards healing.  One way that I have found that helps me to develop positive thinking is developing gratefulness.  Because the more grateful we are, the more good we can see, which in turn makes us even more grateful.Gratitude has a twofold effect. A person who offers thanks is likely inclined to feel good about himself, and the one who receives the thanks feels better too.“Robert Emmons, codirector of a University of California study project on gratitude, made this point: “Seeing with grateful eyes requires that we see the web of interconnection in which we alternate between being givers and receivers.” The fact is that our lives are sustained and supported by others in many ways. For example, they may provide our food or give us medical attention.” Perhaps we could think about simple things like our meals that we eat, then think of the manys way we can be grateful.1-Did you really enjoy a meal today?2-What did you like about it?3- Are you grateful for the person who prepared it? Even if it's you, you can be happy that you accomplished it.4-Even the farmers and producers; we may not know them but are we grateful for their hard work?Keep going!

That way I can only focus on what I am doing.  I have the capability of doing the dishes, though a dishwasher would be nice, oh, I am the dishwasher...

It can actually help them to let it go, or at least to a point, even though shrinks know that you can't just suddenly and magically let it go.

We've known each other for most of our lives. She has this habit of kind of - hanging on to the past, and assuming these memories are crystal clear and objective, even when nobody else remembers them the same way, or at all. In them, every fault, every mistake (real or perceived) everything is amplified 300%.  Once, she was talking about a distant event where she felt she was 'so useless' and when I told her I felt she was on fire that evening, it kind of left her stunned, because it was completely at odds with the fiction she'd built for herself.Many of her other friends see it the same way, too. I don't think being told to let it go would help her; she has a very analytic mindset. Whether chemical or psychological, I think some people simply can't let it go as easily as others - for example, with my gallows humor, I'm pretty good at staying cheerful and feeling non-stressed even though life has been full of stressors. But, I think for another set of people, someone - especially in a position of authority - saying that it's okay to let it go, that they CAN let it go, must be incredibly helpful and liberating, a kind of first step towards recovery. Maybe even more.As another view, for people who can't let it go easily, maybe it'd be helpful to look at it as - why can't I let go, and is there a way to turn that into a strength; can I focus on what made me happy, or proud, or did good for my friends?Seriously good topic Mike, I hope this is an okay contribution.Peace!", "commentTimestamp": "9/18/2019 12:24 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "ForeverPositive", "comment": "Hi Ohnoadiskjockey,I definitely agree that it's harder for some people to 'let it go' while for others it's not. Your post actually made me think about my mindset and personality. Like your friend, I repeatedly analyze or ruminate about things in the past. I strive for perfection in all that I do and like order and predictability. I don't know if I would be classified as having an analytical, uptight, or rigid mindset, but I do know that it is very hard for me to let  go of  hurtful incidents which happened years ago; I partly think my mindset or personality is too blame. When I look at my friends, who aren't uptight like me, they seem to let go of things more easily.  For some people, it is easy to let go. Of course, it also depends on what you're 'letting go'. If someone suffered an intense trauma, such as abuse of any nature, I would imagine it might be harder for that person to let it go and move forward with their lives. As MMB, however, said the principle of 'let it go' has helped some trauma victims/survivors, so I guess mindset does play a role, as well as other factors.", "commentTimestamp": "9/18/2019 2:19 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "ohnoadiskjockey", "comment": "ForeverPositive,I can tell you one thing - you have an okay mindset.For real!

Trying to do your best and to create a more rational world is a good goal. Just because that urge sometimes fights whatever you might need to deal with the past doesn't mean that it, or you, are flawed, or to blame, or that there's any part of who you are to blame.Sometimes, our worldviews try to solve every issue the same way though, which - doesn't always work out.

Found out I have osteoporosis. It dislocated 4 months ago. So I have that chronic pain to deal with. I also have lifelong Orthopedic problems in my feet resulting in a number of surgeries. I need another one. I saw the orthopedic Dr about the pain in my feet lately. Did an mri and discovered I have sever Synovitis which eventually led to my RA diagnosis. Started DMARDS about 6 weeks ago. No relief yet. Flare ups have intensified. I’m going to the dr today to talk about prednisone. I’m worried about that affecting my depression and anxiety and weight. I’m 230 and 5’6. I went to a bariatric surgeon last week with high hopes but she said she wanted me to be mentally stable for a year even though my psychiatrist said it was ok. My depression meds make me hungry. These are the best luck we’ve had and I’m not going to change them. I’m doing physical therapy 3 times a week and doing the exercises at home. I just feel so lost and discouraged. The weight contributes to my illness and depression. I can’t get the weight off because of my mental health. It’s a horrible circle.

I am so thankful that I have my mental health in a good place but I'm starting to fall apart. I won't make an egregiously long post with all the details but essentially every single person in my family(mom, sister, dad, 2 grandmas, brother, husband) have really needed me there for support for them this year. Be it mental health, medical issues, losing a loved one, general drama, etc. I also have a 7 year old who was just hospitalized with a bad illness AND a 9 month old. From the day he was born everyone has needed me so much. I thought this was going to be my year where I got to work on my degree, enjoy my baby and get back into shape but there's been a BIG blow up of some sort almost every month. I obviously love the people I'm helping and WANT to help. In fact I HAVE to help. It's in my nature. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't bc I can't stand to see my loved ones hurting. They truly have needed me and have had big problems themselves but I have no one to rely on. I know you have to take care of yourself in order to help others but I don't have anyone to go to or anywhere to turn. If anyone has advice for self care or whatever its greatly appreciated. I have a suicidal loved one currently( as stated in the beginning) and it's scaring me so badly. I'm trying to help but so afraid I'm going to fail. I'm using all reading material I have to help them as it's top priority and urgent but I know I can't operate at my best to help them if I can't find ways for myself to remain okay as well.I feel so selfish even posting this and hope it doesn't come across as super selfish.

The Autumn Joy sedums are just starting to bloom, the crepe myrtle is in it's glory, the deep purple morning glories and lavender/pink bindweed are blooming prolifically.  The Montauk daisies are huge this year and should put on quite a show.  The tassles from the ornamental grasses are just starting to peep out.  Only one dahlia blossom so far but I'm hoping for more.  The canna and hibiscus continue to bring me the colors of summer, so I've bunched the pots together to enjoy for as long as I can.

I'll try to keep this brief but I can make no promises.Years ago my son was arrested for weapons possession (that in itself is a long story).  I had told him he'd have to wait for a bail reduction hearing.  Meanwhile, his sister and step mother went behind my back and arranged for bail.  No one read the fine print at the bottom of the page.  After he was incarcerated, no one kept up on the payments.My daughter had given my phone number on the paperwork, so the collections agency started calling my home about the debt.  I was livid.  Eventually it all went to court and both my daughter and my son agreed the debt was theirs to pay and arrangements were made.Well, those payments got defaulted on and.....yep.....I start getting the phone calls again!  Then, my daughter is sent more court papers saying they are going to collect all of the interest, too!  I talk with the lawyer and ask if a lump sum payment is made, can this all go away?  Terms are worked out and my partner agrees to make the lump sum payment and my children can then pay her back.My daughter has been making the payments...my son has not.  Last night, she starts complaining to me...that I should talk to him and tell him he has to make payments, too.  I came close to exploding on her.None of this is MY mess!  The weapons were my ex-husbands.  I did not arrange for the bail.  I had no papers to read the fine print from.  Yet, I was the one harassed over and over about the payments!  My daughter and grandson live with me...rent free (not what I had in mind) and she has the audacity to complain to me about him not paying!?  My partner paid so that she wouldn't get socked for all of the interest and this is the thanks?So, I called my son.  Told him he needs to respond to her texts.  Told him that I agree he should be helping to pay the money back to my partner.  Then, I told them both this is the last I want to hear anything about the bail, EVER!My ex husband is dead...never should have had any weapons to begin with...step mother should have had them removed from the home after his death...has never paid one dime on this bill or gotten one phone call about it...has gotten off scot free!I'm angry.

Thank you all for your messages - I can't believe how time flies when you're not having fun :-/ Nothing very much has happened. I had my second cataract operation done about 3 weeks ago. It seemed to go okay, but when I saw the opthalmologist last week, he explained that I had something called Posterior Capsule Opacification. This is a pretty common complication of cataract surgery, but most people get it months or years later. I was not expecting to have it already, but apparently it appears quicker in people with uveitis. Anyway, it's easily cured with a laser treatment. The good news is it might sharpen up my blurry vision; the bad news is I have to wait 3 months. Because of this I've decided to hold off on travelling. My vision isn't so bad I can't see, but the left eye ended up being blurrier than the right one and the overall effect is quite irritating. I was actually going to get some new glasses, but the opthalmologist advised me to wait. In the meantime I've got a cheap pair of bogstandard reading glasses. I can actually read better than I did before, but anything further than a foot and a bit away is useless. I was thinking of getting a pair of intermediate distance glasses as well, but I will wait until I've had this laser treatment done (luckily both eyes can be treated at once.)I'm still thinking about getting a dog >_>. I am still off the quetiapine (Seroquel). Ironically enough, stopping it didn't solve the issue I had stopped it for in the first place (blurry vision), but I decided not to resume it anyway. Different reasons really, but the main one was that the grogginess was getting worse over time. I hadn't increased the dose in a year, yet I went from being relatively functional to being barely able to function during the daytime - by the late evening I would wake up and feel lively, then not get to sleep until 4 or 5am. When I stopped the quetiapine, I didn't get a wink of sleep for 3 days. Then over the next 4 weeks, I would get a couple of hours here and there at most. That I manage to fall asleep fairly easily now I credit to melatonin. Started taking 300mcg 4 hours before bedtime. And as long as I remain consistent with taking it at the same time every night, it works. So..... what's the problem? I'm sleeping okay, I can even make morning appointments now! I don't really know. Seroquel is a strong drug and even at my relatively low dose, it still made me feel like I was wrapped in a chemical security blanket at times. I kind of miss that comforting numbness. Now I'm numb but in an even.... number way, which I wasn't expecting when I stopped it. When I'm not utterly unable to feel anything at all, I feel only one of two things: rage or dread. The other night I tried to feel sadness, which I know is there, and it was almost impossible - I had to go through an exhausting and grim rage first, silently, because it was night time and my neighbours were probably asleep above me. As for happiness, lol, what is that? <_<I am hoping that this is still a readjustment to the quetiapine. I stopped it 6-7 weeks ago and all the physical side-effects (the extreme itching, temperature regulation issues, insomnia, etc.) have gone now. But I do know it can take a long time for the brain to return to homeostasis - neurotransmitters to return to normal levels, receptors to recover, etc. With opiates especially, there is a post-acute withdrawal syndrome which can last for months. But it can occur with other types of drugs too. I've been on a lot of other psychiatric meds too, and I do wonder how they've messed with my brain. The trouble is, nothing really works for me and I can't cope with life, people, the universe, everything. Even spiders are a source of fear for me, especially in the late summer (that's right now, guys). Let me tell the story of spiderbro. A few weeks ago I was coming home late one night from my parents' house. Before I entered the block of flats, I looked at the doorway for a few seconds, subconsciously scanning for spiders. I saw nothing. Reached for the door when a massive house spider scuttled past it at great speed, just missing my hand. Dear god, where did it come from? I probably broke a world record that night for backwards long-jumping. I just had time to see the spider go into the corner between the door and the wall. Now that wall happened to be the wall of my flat - my bedroom specifically. Once I had summoned up the courage to enter my flat, I sprayed spider repellent around all the doors and window frames and if I could have erected \"No Spider\" signs, I would have done that too. Well, to cut this exciting story short, spiderbro lived up there in that corner for 3 weeks. He would swivel around from time to time, and occasionally he even moved an actual centimetre or so! His life was nearly as pointless as mine, bless him. Anyway, a few days ago spiderbro packed his bags and left for new and undiscovered corners. To my surprise, I was a little bit sad to see him gone  I had got used to him, although I'm still terrified of seeing a massive house spider inside my flat. I can't rationalise my way out of this phobia either: god only knows I've tried. Maybe the next step is to try a spider as a pet.... >.>*sees time* Okay, well I've rambled enough :p It's pretty much my bedtime now anyway (that entire post took a lot longer to write than I thought it would).

I will put it here, my secret fear, and then maybe I can come back at a later date and laugh at how stupid I was. Or ask you guys to send food parcels. I'm only half joking, that's the thing: I really am scared about food shortages and the resulting chaos, rioting and martial law. I am not saying these things will definitely happen - I am saying it's one possibility out of several. That's the worst case scenario that has been hinted at, but not actually given to the British public yet. The scenarios that have been leaked so far are pretty terrifying already, tbh. Believe it or not, there is potentially an even bigger problem than Brexit and that's the right wing coup which is behind Brexit. That's another story and as much as I would love to talk about #StopTheCoup, it probably is too overtly political for this forum.Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest.

The giant house spider also used to hold the world record for top spider speed. From wikipedia: With speeds clocked at 1.73 ft/s (0.53 m/s; 1.18 mph; 1.90 km/h), the giant house spider held the Guinness Book of World Records for top spider speed until 1987 when it was displaced by solifugids, although the latter are not true spiders.The speed at with which spiderbro whipped past me a few weeks ago, I'm not surprised.

(The jumping spiders are an exception and have excellent eyesight: they can even see the moon. Plus they are oddly, weirdly cute ;_;)@Trina - I've heard of mint oil as a spider repellent (conkers are another one). We had an ant problem in our old house, and they were a bit of a nightmare. I'm not normally squeamish about ants but one night I went down to the kitchen to get a drink, and the floor was literally black with ants. I have never, ever seen so many ants in one place - it honestly made me feel slightly ill. Anyway, I just went back up to bed sans drink. Don't think I've seen an ant in my flat. As I'm not too bothered by the spindly daddy long legs spiders I leave those ones be. I wonder if I would see more insects if they weren't around.

Been following politics closely this week and even watching parliament live (I know, I know - I officially have no life). It was tremendously satisfying seeing Johnson have to pretend he didn't want an election, and then almost begging the opposition to give him an election the very next day - he was heard shouting \"call an election, you great big girl's blouse!\" at Corbyn, the Labour leader. Johnson also called a motion for an early general election, but he failed to get the votes. Needless to say, the motion is being brought back again on Monday: this is all reminding me very strongly of May, who also absolutely refused to take 'no' for an answer. Only politicians get to have as many votes as they want: the general public must abide by a single vote they made 3 years ago. On a more positive note, some brilliant speeches have been made. The standout one for me was made by a Labour MP, Jess Phillips. Oh, and Johnson is now a minority government :D (The main reason he is so desperate for an election. He's cornered at every step of the way unless he can get a majority back.)*sees time* I'd better go >.>", "commentTimestamp": "9/5/2019 5:48 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "ForeverPositive", "comment": "I saw MP Jess Phillips' speech (I've been loosely following what's going on in the UK).

In fact, you can't escape it. Politics is discussed everywhere, from daytime and nighttime talk shows, the workplace, to family gatherings.

The amount of unintentional farce this week alone could keep a satirist in material for years. Anyway, the good news is the House of Lords passed the Benn bill which blocks no deal by forcing Johnson to ask the EU for an extension by the 19th October at the latest. The bad news is that Johnson has said he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than not leave on the 31st October (while a poor policewoman passed out behind him), which will create a very interesting legal situation if he disobeys the law. In other front page news, I broke my phone! ;_; The battery was failing, so I ordered a new one and tried to replace it. The old battery was stuck down with glue and I scratched a flat ribbon underneath it trying to prise it out. Put the new battery in anyway and hoped it would work. The phone gamely tried to power up, but alas it gave up the unequal struggle for existence and passed out like the policewoman above. I'm thinking of having a go at replacing the ribbon, just for the fun of it, but in the meantime I've ordered a new phone. I highly doubt I can get the old phone working again, but if I do, I can use it as a back up or give it to my brother. The new phone is a Pixel 3. I do hope it will be okay. Google phones have a reputation for being buggy, but this one had all the main things I was looking for - reasonable size/not massive, notch-free (I don't care if bezels are 'sooo 2015', I hate notches), fast processor, excellent camera, etc. And I managed to get it for under £500 from eBay.

I've got an in-built night light that actually works and is so much better than the blue light filter app I had on my previous phone (it wasn't the app's fault to be fair: the Android 8 update broke it).

I’m 37 yrs old but i have no clue what I’m really feeling or thinking without these medicines. Ughhhhhhhh.   Wishes don’t work but sometimes that’s what i do...    I’ll take the sad and the bumps in the road i just wanna be able to deal with them and feel happiness.  I know no ones happy or satisfied all of the time.  But i don’t want to keep thinking “the worst” all the time.  I always question whether or not to do inpatient, when I’m REALLY down and out.    But i always tell myself I’ll get through it. And somehow somehow i do. So it remains all thoughts and no actions.   I’m not someone without friends or family.  I have both but i seek isolation when im like this and then it’s also the last thing that i want to be- alone.   Recently been pondering over a avoidance personality disorder diagnosis—-   Which apparently no medicine or treatment will lift.  It’s all me.   That’s the scary part. Ughhhhh.

I did some research, spoke to some friends and family.   I have to get some sort of a life back and medicines aren’t helping me.  While i do go to therapy, that’s about all i do and that just isn’t a life for me.  I know this because when I’m not depressed, i love life and doing things and being with people. Docs have suggested bi polar might be in my mix. Anyway. I’m afraid because other major treatments have not worked for me. So again it’s like a trial...    i always think that it’s like my fault i have depression, it’s a me thing.  That the medicines aren’t working cause i don’t have the same depression or anxiety that most have.  Anyone ever get like that?  My therapist is trying to help me see that it’s my genetics plus life experiences that make me, me:   But if i could make the “healthier” or more positive choice i would, but That’s exactly what my issue is.  I can see both options but i default to the “bed and covers”  Today I’m all sad, the relentless crying and I’ve tried breathing, taking a walk, watching something positive on youtube, tv, and just sitting with the awful feelings and let them pass by. Coming on here and reading and now typing out some venting.    But it doesn’t make me feel better.  I’m doing this cycle consistently.

I saved a little bird from my parents’ filter in their pool.  Not that it was so difficult to do, but it made me happy. I actually felt happiness and when i went back to check and see if the little guy left the area where i placed him in the woods, he was gone, I pictured him away flying or with his family safe. I def heard a concerned family member squawking when i was handling him.   My dr says i shouldn’t wish to extend the good feeling, cause that’s how depression works. It feeds on the non happy times making it worse and unhealthy.  Instead be proud that i saved the little bird, took some action.   In my head i hope n pray that something “good” will happen for me then.    That’s my truth, i know it must sound like a jerk, but sometimes hope is all i have...

I personally do not know where to start, but recently a little over a week ago things took a turn so quickly my head is still spinning. I’m so confused, heartbroken, frustrated, I don’t ever ask for help, but I’m not getting any from parents on either side. I told her parents that we need to be a “rock” for her, a strong foundation. It right now looks like I’m going to be alone in the healing process,She had told me she had been depressed for around 2 months (either I’m blind or she was hiding it), I started to notice her over worrying 10-11 days ago. It’s hard to give a exact time because weeks have been feeling like days and all of them are blurred. Last Wednesday I do remember however, because my wife and I were sorting out the laundry on our bed, myself on one side and her on the other. She stopped out of the blue and puts her hands on the bed and it looked like she was just tired or maybe thinking about something. Then she lets out a pain like noise as if your gut turned and she fainted. I was caught off guard I ran over and started patting her cheek calling her name, she came to and after about 10 min of sitting and holding her, she was ready enough to lay in bed. She fell asleep and would wake up asking if this and that got done and I would tell her “yes, it’s all done let’s get some sleep”, she would fall asleep and she would wake up again asking the same question, I would respond with the same answer. This loop happened probably 8 times in about 45 min time. From that night on everything changed drastically, I’m dealing with 2 different people it feels like. Since that little scare her attitude is like a light switch and I’m on egg shells because ANYTHING can set her off. I quickly learned when she throws verbal punches to just let them roll off, i’ve recognized when her mood has changed because she can’t think straight, talk coherently, and feels like I need to be lectured on how things need to happen. Common sense is absent at these points and it’s all rambling. I take a deep breath and just take it. She worries about the past and the next day, little things turn into massive giants( such as getting the kids ready for school), night time recently have been real bad because of those worries. She has punched walls (more then once) and slammed her head on the cabinet (one time). She says she needs my help and when I ask what can I do to help, she tells me nothing and to just go away and that’s just one of many wants but doesn’t want. I’m dealing with a double edged sword and it’s frustrating. I’m doing everything I can to stay strong when she can’t be, I dread coming home because who knows what lays in wait for me. Our kids (6 and 4) do not seem to be showing any sadness or reflecting how they are seeing mama, I had told my wife, “we need to get you checked out”, ohhhhh how naive I am to say such a stupid thing, I feel lucky to be tying this now. But I manned up and told her I want her in to have a check up, get blood work done and check blood pressure and so on, then we will take steps from there to tackle this thing. She wants nothing to do with it. She thinks there is nothing that will come of it, I told her it’s a starting point. I am very tired, but staying strong I think. She is trying to handle it herself which in turn is breaking us down. She is not on any meds for anything. I don’t know if this is a combination of past guilt and repetition of day to day life or just the daily repetition. Her eating is so minimal it makes her sick. I’m sorry I gotta stop, I can keep going, it’s late and I hope I made sense enough.

It can often be difficult to get in to see a psychiatrist so I would recommend she start with her primary doctor. They can usually refer much quicker. She is exhibiting concerning behavior along with the depressive symptoms. If you feel she could be a danger to herself or others at any time or feel she is out of control either take her to the hospital or call 911 and they will come and take her to the ER to be evaluated. You can see if there are emergency mental health services in your area (usually it’s a screener) who you can contact if she is in crisis and they can send someone to the home to talk to her. When in doubt call 911- hard to do I know I’ve been there but you have two young kids to think about and she needs professional help ASAP. If you feel you need to do any of the above you can ask a friend or family member to watch your kids so they aren’t around if you need to hospitalize her.

The things that pull me out, and this could take a couple of days, however I try to stick to repeating until it works:hold ice over the sink until it hurts 6 sec maybe,  then 3 cleansing breaths.    deep breath, raise arms shoulder height then let breath with a noise exhale and just drop arms. get outside for 10min.  I sit out back even if it is just on the step for 10 mins, sometimes I even time it if I am bad. The light and fresh air will eventually work unless there is a medical reason you can go out.eventually I get back to walking. I have 2 dogs and this gets me up and out of bed, does not get me off the couch necessarily, but I do need to let them out and feed them.  Petting and cuddling them helps.  The unconditional love is a medicine that can not be bought.I understand some people are not pet oriented, so perhaps a small fish tank with 2 fish,  this has been proven to be relaxing and  reduces anxietyI use mindfulness and meditation.  Insight timer is a free downland for your phone and has lots of helpful stuff. Alsohttps://mindful.org is a good site.  Search is in top right corner.When I could not get out of the dark places and was inpatient,  I had a long talk with a compassionate nurse.  She suggested I do things I was told I was to stupid to do when I was young.  I am 58 now.  so...I am teaching myself piano, using books and youtube.  I have a $200 keyboard.  I do it when I feel like it and enjoy it.I started messing around with paints on cardboard just to release some emotions, and I now enjoy painting.  I even sell one every so often.  I paint what I feel, when I feel it.  I have no training.  I sew, embroider,  needle point, crochet  Post for donations on the neighborhood website,  collect hats, gloves, blankets for a mens shelter and The Covent house near me.   Also yarn to make hats for both. Try to find a support group.  I attend one for mental illness.  Mostly biopolar attends, but there are people with my dx's. Been going for 5 yrs.  Just making a few good friends.  Depression and other things makes it hard for me to trust.  Took a year for me to get comfortable in the group.  It was so worth it to stick it out!!Lately I have begun going out to lunch with a friend from my support group.  I hope some of this helps you.

Probably an implant.I will definitely do something - my jaw muscles have a tendency to tighten and 'cause issues if I do the \"chew on one side\" thing.

I told her I'd been denied so many times already for medicaid.  She told me they had put the applications in for the wrong program!  She helped me put in an application for the Aged, Blind and Disabled program this time.  Fingers crossed that I get approved.  Medicare doesn't cover dental but this Medicaid program is supposed to!The garden is still blooming nicely.  I have a few 'reblooming' day lilies, the tropical hibiscus and canna, the crepe myrtle bush and morning glories going strong!  The helenium bloomed nicely this year, too, and the dahlia is just getting started.  The oak leaf hydrangea blooms have faded to brown but they still look great and I can't wait to see how the leaves turn color yet.  I've added to my collection of sedum this year, too.  Found one that is supposed to bloom red.  So much still to come but I think I'll pick up some early mums for now to tide me over.Had another 'chat' with daughter and grandson about helping around the house.  She's taken it to heart but he's still being lazy and unmotivated.  Might have to turn off the wifi to get his attention!Daughter's weaning off hydrocortisone is going well, though.  She's down to just 7.5 mg a day!  She won't have more blood work done until October and we're hoping her cortisol will be good enough to come off the hc altogether.  The HRT has been helping in so many ways!  She has more energy and her blood sugars are coming down wonderfully since estrogen makes her more insulin sensitive!  Her body is trying so hard to get back to 'normal'.  They switched her off of Celexa and put her on Cymbalta hoping it will not only help her depression but also with pain.  We'll see.  So far, it's not looking great...they've had to up her to 60mg/day.

I seriously thought we were going to lose him...he was in such bad shape and no idea what happened!  He had disappeared for 36 hrs during one of the heat waves and was found laying on the patio drinking water from my fountain.  Unable to stand or walk!

He sleeps with me every night now and sometimes gets in the tub, just to be left alone from the dogs I think!  Micah has taken to 'cleaning' him daily.  His head and neck will be soaked from her licking and his hair will be all spiked up like a rebellious teenager!  So funny to see!I fixed my own washing machine the other day.  'Someone' didn't check their pockets well and coins got in the wash...turns out a penny was stuck in the pump...horrible noise when the water would discharge.  We took the back off and my partner tilted the machine forward and held it while I took out the pump and got the penny out.

I lost count of the number of very good friends, serious boyfriends, acquaintances and colleagues who either died slowly or were suddenly gone – a surprise from AIDS. Beyond the sadness of losing so many people in general, AIDS frightened me very much – because in the beginning itʼs consequence was death. There are likely so many personal stories we both could share Iʼll forgo more details.I wasnʼt until after after 9-11 and a MS in Counseling (in 1997) that I began to realize how much AIDS changed my life. I was a direct report to the CFO and because an early retirement deal wasnʼt creating a suitable RIF, it was opened to all employees except officers. The next day I gave my boss a heads up I was retiring after 25 years. After I left I was struggling with life so much I could not care for myself. I lied during an intake interview to a state mental hospital by say yes to 3 questions that required my admittance. I was already diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder: Severe and they added PTSD, and GAD. I found relief for all three with Paxil and Xanax to the point I was able to slowly reduce and eliminate the MEDs. Realizing I had not set foot in a jet or been in airport since 1994 (itʼs 2019 now) realized I was still in trouble. I figured out I relieved my earlier symptoms by eliminating everything that caused fear, anxiety and depression. It resulted in moving, losing contact with my friends and anything associated with commercial aviation. I only went out a night, didnʼt read mail or answer my phone. I tried a few new Psychiatrists but they wanted me to start from the beginning and prescribe MEDs I did not need and were not therapeutic. (Ambien, Prozac and half a half a 0.5mg of Klonopin).Fortunately my new PCP listened when when we spoke and agreed to my request for Wellbutrin XL (now 300mg) and 2mg of Xanax 2 X a day. After the Wellbutrin had kicked in and was effective, we reviewed the Xanax and reduced it to 1 mg up to twice a day as needed. Wellbutrin will be around for a while. The Xanax will probably end in November.Iʼm moving, plan to relearn how to non-rev, and Iʼm eager to have friends. I wasted years of my life alone and unhappy because I allowed the past to restrict my present and eliminate my future. Eventually peoplesʼ perception of time changes. As a kid the last few minutes before the final bell took an eternity. Now, each day feels shorter adding another challenge to my life.Donʼt allow the fear, sadness, losses, and beliefs from your past control your current life. Itʼs especially problematic for those who were around during the rapid onset and growth of death by AIDs. You were surrounded by immense sadness and grief for years. Grief diminishes with time, but grief for a special one or few will remain. Whether your choice or not, itʼs OK. Please end the fear and anger. It honors no one and holds you back. Iʼve just shared what I believe Iʼve done that had insignificant if not dangerous outcomes and probably exacerbated my desire, hope and ability to continue the life I lived and expected to continue until the end. If youʼre not able to attain peace alone seek help. Turn to family, friends, forums, libraries, online sites and professionals such as medical doctors , psychiatrists and counselorsIn the grand scheme, life is short. Determine if some changes will improve your quality of life. If obstacles remain, attempt to force your self, if thatʼs not happening, seek help from your phone. FaceTime from Apple, Googleʼs Hangout and new app called Duo which works with FaceTime. Most people use Facebook and they have Messenger. Worried about quality? Use the Doctors on Demand App. Itʼs by Dr Phil and besides medical doctors, it can quickly connect you with a psychiatrist, psychologist, or Counselor. Keep in mind Medicare is not accepted.I still have farther to go, but after 2 lousy shrinks and 3 Doctors who didnʼt let me talk I finally found doc with ears who wants to hear me speak. I wouldnʼt presume to say I know how you feel, but if my experience helps in any way, I just passed forward something wonderful a stronger did for me. I hope you figure it out and find help from people who want to hear everything you want and NEED to say.ScoutPost Edited (I8aapple) : 8/10/2019 3:17:13 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "8/10/2019 1:38 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "HI Scout,Thanks for sharing your experiences, that was so kind of you.Welcome to the depression forum.

I always encourage other people to believe in themselves and I give pretty darn good advice to everyone (except myself) but even with all the effort i make, it's becoming really apparent that people still find me intolerable to be around and it's really making me wonder what the point of my life is if i don't even have friends who enjoy my company.I am negative when i talk about myself, if someone asks me how i am and whether i've got a boyfriend yet my typical repsonse is probably 'Ah, you know, i'm ok and no, of course i haven't got a boyfirend, i'll never get a boyfriend!'. I tend to then breeze past talking anymore about me or my feelings because i know that it's negative and therefore i try and just talk about the other person all the time in order to be good company.I've noticed more and more of my 'friends' saying things to me like 'You need to learn to be happy', 'Maybe you didn't have a good time because you're always so miserable' 'Maybe you felt like she was being off with you because you're always paranoid and make things up in your head. You're just jealous because they're happy and you're not'. And although these people still then class themselves as my friends, i'm wondering if they really are friends if my negativity is so obvious and unbearable. It's making me not want to socialise because i feel like i either have to avoid talking about myself totally, or i have to put on a fake face and be like 'yeah i'm great, i'm so happy and love my life!' in order to please them.I really feel like i go out of my way to always support other people and be positive about them and their stories so i'm really disheartened to hear that so many people still see me as draining and negative.I'm totally lost in my life now as i've been down about my ex and unable to move on for years but now i feel like i don't want to see mates either which means i've literally got nothing.", "commentTimestamp": "6/6/2019 2:48 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "You have you.

As for the \"negativity\", it is a core symptom of depression. My advice would be to drop your friends and concentrate on you. Do what pleases/interests you for a change.

You never know with whom you might identify and find support.On the other hand, loneliness can extend even onto the Internet and the different support sites. On a couple I visit, there are clearly groups of users who are on the same wavelength and \"click\" with one another to provide support when needed. I think some of the typical forum features, like friends lists, followers, and up-voting, inadvertently make others feel like outsiders. At least on some user profiles there it says \"Your friends list is empty\", as opposed to \"You have no friends\", which I guess would be even more unintentionally damaging to the psyche.In any case, the point is that one needs to be active and seeking out others on these forums. Your active participation -- posts, replies, reactions, votes, etc. -- is the only way others are even aware of you.

Me and good news are an oxymoron <_<. On a serious note, I was in a pretty bad downward spiral. My eye issues tipped me over the edge: I became convinced I would never be able to see properly again. I would have panic attacks about losing my sight altogether and becoming completely blind, and no amount of reason could counter the cold-blooded fear at 3am. Thus I was pessimistic and scared of my upcoming cataract operation. It loomed like a Damocles sword over my head for months. On top of that, my Crohn's was playing up: hello, nocturnal trips to the toilet 3x a night. Piss off, nocturnal trips to the toilet 3x a night.Anyway, I finally had the dreaded operation yesterday. I read Animal Farm on my Kindle whilst waiting for the operation, because there's nothing like a good depressing political allegory to make you even more depressed (brilliant book though). I was surprisingly anxiety-free until I was wheeled into the operating theatre, whereupon I became terrified that I would get an urge to have a BM during the procedure! Supposing I moved whilst the surgeon was cutting into my eye? Whilst they did the pre-op preparations, I lay there completely still and dared my bowels to so much as even hint at an urge. Then another thought occurred to me: would my vision go completely dark during the surgery? I turned to worrying about that instead, and my bowels and body remained completely still the entire time. No, my vision never went dark. The intolerable glare of the overhead light turned into 3 fuzzy yellow lights floating above me. There was a distant sound of a drill or a saw. I never saw or felt anything go into my actual eye - just those 3 yellow lights constantly moving all over the place. After a few minutes, I was able to relax a little and the intense fear receded. Afterwards I was wheeled out into the discharge lounge with a patch over my right eye. My parents and my mum's friend picked me up from the hospital. I wasn't allowed to take the patch off until the next morning. The immediate impression was one of confusion and of being underwhelmed. It wasn't until my dad got to me read a license plate across the road and persuaded me I could see well enough to drive, that the implications began to sink in.However it wasn't until I went out with my mum and her friend that I fully grasped them. I not only could see, I could see much better than I ever had. It literally was like seeing the world in HD for the first time. I saw a bunch of wild poppies on the canal bank and goggled at how red they were. In the garden centre, I covered my uncorrected left eye and goggled at all the plants, leaves and flowers - everything was so crisp and clear, it would make a grown man weep. Meanwhile, my left eye - which had the 'good' vision - now seems really poor: incredibly blurry and dim. But the right eye can compensate for that, at least long distance. I do have a slight complication: my right eye resembles something from a horror movie. It's red. I don't mean the pinkish-red of inflammation, I mean bright, bright red. Looking as though it's about to weep blood red. I hesitantly googled it and had the happy - and first - experience of google giving me a mundane and reassuring answer instead of an extremely rare and deadly disease. Confirmed it with a few more searches, but 99% sure now it's a subconjunctival haemorrhage. Sounds scary, but actually it's just a broken blood vessel in the white part of the eye and is completely harmless. But it does take 1-2 weeks to go away, so I have to go around looking like something out of Dracula until then. I've got to go to bed now. Sorry for the long ramble. I'll show you a photo of the wild poppies I took earlier to (hopefully) make it worth it.

I will try the CBD oil first, but if that doesn't help then I will definitely give melatonin another try. I was taking it wrong in the past: way too late and probably at too high a dose. My car failed its MOT :-( Something to do with the headlights - no idea what. They did say, but I didn't really catch it. Have to go back next week and get them fixed. It's annoying, as my headlights seem fine to me. But I've been going to that garage for 10 years and they've never mugged me off before, so I believe them.

Almost immediately a rather elegant and tanned old lady joined me. She. wouldn't. stop. talking. I wanted to eat my lunch, but couldn't because I don't like eating in front of people I don't know. She wanted to eat her lunch, but couldn't because of the fat pigeon which stood there for absolutely ages just waiting for food. At one point she got up and had a quick rummage in the bin next to the bench looking for food, but didn't find anything suitable. My braindead brain was like, 'w-t-f'. In retrospect, I think she must have been looking for something for the fat pigeon and not herself, which is what I first thought.  Watched another pigeon picking up twigs - it was obviously building a nest in a nearby tree - and the crows. One perched atop a tombstone a couple of times. Crows in a graveyard are so great. I also watch the birds in my parents' garden. Nothing as exotic as hummingbirds, but we do have a pair of ring-necked doves, which is nice. Oops. I left for this a couple of hours. I slept last night but I needed to take half a tablet of quetiapine to do so. I think I will start cutting all my tablets in half from now on and then into quarters.

Okay, long story short, phoned up eye casualty. Receptionist recommended I see an optician so I went and made an appointment with a local one for tomorrow. The red tint has gone now anyway. Suspect my right eye may have got sunburnt. ((Yes, it's a thing.) I noticed yesterday that my right arm was browner than my left arm, and that can only have come from driving - it's the only way my right arm could have got more sun exposure than the left. I'm on meds which can increase photosensitivity, e.g. 6MP and I've noticed for the last few years I do tan much quicker than I used to.Anyway, I'm just relieved that I (probably) don't have cystoid macular edema after all. Re your dog. It does sound like she needs more exercise tbh. Is there anywhere you can let her run off the leash for a while, e.g. a field or park. And, yes, an evening walk would be good for her. Some dog breeds are naturally chill, e.g. bull mastiffs. I used to know one, and she was the most placid dog ever: I don't think an active volcano would have stirred that thing. Our old dog, a Jack Russell terrier, had boundless energy when he was young - he would chase a football for hours and not get tired of it. He did calm down and need less exercise as he got older. Okay, I'm gonna go and get my dinner now. I got a Waygu steak, much reduced :p Never had one before, so looking forward to giving it a go.Post Edited (NiceCupOfTea) : 7/2/2019 12:42:03 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "7/2/2019 11:39 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "I am sorry you lost your post Miranda, that is so frustrating, especially if it was a lot.

Long story short: my eyes are physically fine. He thought the red tint might have been caused by a small bleed in the back of the eye, but there was no sign of that on the scan. Anyway, whatever it was, it's gone now. I can finally relax until the next panic <_<. I didn't order any new glasses as there's no point until I've had the left eye done and both eyes have settled completely from surgery. I'm knackered, as I was awake for hours last night with nausea and diarrhoea. Something really upset my stomach. My dinner I presume, although steak and chips doesn't usually upset my stomach to that degree. It isn't any too great tonight, but never mind :-/ My friend has got a new dog! A 4-year-old greyhound from a rescue place. She seems happy with him and he looks nice from the pictures. I thought she and her husband might get a guide dog first, given that the previous guide dog sadly and unexpectedly died of an inoperable tumour a few weeks ago. It's interesting how only a very few breeds are suitable for being a guide dog - a greyhound isn't one of those breeds apparently.Anyhow, another day, another bedtime. Gonna lie down and read.

However, I haven't used it yet. Took one look at the instructions and thought \"later.\" That was 2 weeks ago :-( No, I've not read my brother's book yet. Truth to tell, I'm not looking forward to reading it - I can't help feeling it'll be very depressing, with no humour to lighten the darkness. That said, I will read it once I've finished my current book, 'Children Of Time.' It's really good so far. Much, much, much more readable than 'Aurora', which was also about space travel and humans searching for a new planet to live on. But it's long and I'm not the world's fastest reader, because internet and videogames.Anyway, my brother has come down for a week. Today we went to my oldest brother's place for a BBQ. I wasn't looking forward to going, but I had a nicer time than expected: I even managed to stay off my phone for most of it. Saw my nephews for the first time in ages. They are growing up so fast: I still have a mental image of them being about 5 years younger than they really are, because I used to see them far more when they were younger. But they're good lads. The oldest, especially, has really come out of his shell and is not in the least bit sullen or reserved (unlike me at that age). Andrina - I'm still getting all the certificates! Ordered my grandfather's wedding certificate a few weeks ago, which really should have arrived by now and hasn't. I need that and his death certificate still, plus signed and witnessed copies of my documents and my mother's documents, e.g. passports. That part is going to be a bit of a nightmare, as I need to find a professional who knows me - well, how many professionals do I know? But I can probably get my GP or dentist to do it for a fee. I'm doing okay, thanks. I daresay it won't last forever, but I'm out of the immediate woods of depression. Getting the cataract surgery helped. The uveitis is under control. Hopefully my eyes will continue to be okay and not deteriorate. I'm also starting Stelara on the 15th June, so I hope that will help with the Crohn's side of things. Will go to bed soon.

Ordered the death certificate as well, which will probably take just as long to arrive. In the meantime I'm gonna try and get all the relevant documents signed and witnessed. I need a professional person who personally knows me, who also has a stamp or a business card - yeah, I know so many of those. Thinking of making an appointment with my bank manager, who I wouldn't know if I fell over them in the bank, but hopefully the DFA won't know that. At any rate, I would hope a bank manager has a business card, if nothing else. And this is just to become an Irish citizen. I've still got to get the passport after that :/ It's going to take at least a year, but the good news is Brexit won't affect it.Still determined to get off the quetiapine. I can barely read at times, it's so blurry. It wasn't quite as bad before the cataract operation, but now I've lost the ability to see close up with my right eye and I'm heavily dependent on my left eye to see anything close up at all - it's easier to read if I use an eye patch. I will take half a dose tonight, then a quarter of the dose the next night. Luckily quetiapine clears the system rapidly, so if it is that, I should hopefully see an improvement in a day or two.

At least when I hear you're doing well, it makes me feel a bit better. Maybe tomorrow will be a good day.When do you start stelara?", "commentTimestamp": "7/11/2019 7:49 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "NiceCupOfTea", "comment": "Hi folks.@Karen - I enjoyed the trip to St Albans and would definitely like to go back there. There's an amazing cathedral which is literally a mish mash of architectural styles through the ages. You get a small taster of what churches must have once looked like, before everything was destroyed, painted over, or replaced. Been a bit of a struggle since. I stopped the quetiapine for a couple of nights. The first night I got literally no sleep. The second night I got 2-3 hours. The third night (which was last night), I took half a tablet because I needed to be at the hospital at 11am for my first Stelara infusion. Even though I did get a full night's sleep I was so tired I could barely function. When I found out that a problem had occurred and the Stelara wouldn't be arriving until 4pm, I almost felt like crying :-/ I didn't want to do the whole drive home and back again, but the time passed by quite quickly without me doing a lot: I was so tired, I spent a long time sitting in my car. I managed to doze a little bit and that helped a lot: I felt almost human again. Another reason why I want to stop the quetiapine is that I think it contributes a *lot* to this type of grogginess. It's not as noticeable when I don't have to get up for anything, but it still takes me hours just to get out of bed and get dressed. For a long time I put it down to depression and lack of motivation, but I think quetiapine-induced sedation may be causing it as well. My sleeping pattern was also getting more and more out of whack and I want to try and bring it within whack. It's horrible being a braindead zombie all day until literally about 11pm and then feeling lively and fully awake. I do like the night time - always have done. But on a practical level, I still need to do stuff during the day sometimes, e.g. attend appointments. When you're struggling to cope with even afternoon appointments, you know you've got a problem.I've decided to try low dose melatonin for Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. I don't have an official diagnosis, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this is what's causing my inability to fall asleep until 4 or 5am, even with quetiapine. Unfortunately the recommended dose for treating DSPS is very low and I can't even get it in the UK, so I had to order it from the US. Bit annoyed by that, as that will increase the delivery time to about 3 weeks. So yeah, it's all a bit of a struggle at the moment. Sleep deprivation really does make it harder to regulate your negative emotions and I need that about as much as I need a hole in the head. (Also, quetiapine withdrawal symptoms may be having an effect too.) I just realised I forgot to tie up the Stelara business >_>. I did get my Stelara eventually at 5:30pm. The loading dose is an hour long infusion and the Stelara was due to expire at 7pm, so I really did just get it in the nick of time. No side effects. Thankfully it works quicker than Entyvio, so hopefully I will notice a difference within a few weeks. I'm getting so tired of diarrhoea, urgency, and chronic low-grade abdominal pain (with occasional severe pain) - amongst other things, I am sure it affects the quality of my sleep. So I hope it does help.@nssg - Today :p I share your frustration at life passing by. I feel like I've wasted my life and that it's too late to train for an interesting career, and that I'm doing nothing at all. I wish I could help, because it's crappy feeling that way.

I enjoy cooking but I don't think I'd like to do it as a job. I don't feel like I'd like doing anything for money. Once it comes down to hours = money, I get really down. I wish I could live without money at the forefront of everything I do. I realize it is the same story for everyone so I try not to let it get to me. It just brings me down that I spend the majority of my time trying to make a dollar. This is how it's been for as long as I remember and probably how it will be until I keel over somewhere. I don't see the point in all of it. Everyone is so worried about child-rearing and I am just worried about the point of it all.

I was bone, bone tired, and hoped this would be sufficient to make me nod off. It wasn't. I had a song stuck in my head for hours that I couldn't get rid of. The strange thing is that it stuck at all, since while that used to happen to me when I was younger, it rarely does now. Finally after about 3 hours I sank into a dream-filled doze for a few minutes, then woke up. The dreams were creepy as hell. (I only remember a couple of images from them now.) Same thing happened again later on in the night - nodding off straight into bad dreams, only to promptly wake up again.I gave up on sleep for that night, but actually I did get a bit of sleep mid-morning. Maybe an hour or so, not really sure. I didn't want to sleep for too long anyway, because I'm trying to retrain my body clock to fall asleep by 2am, not 9am! Meanwhile, I decided to order more melatonin, 1mg pills this time. (As long as they're not timed/sustained release, I should be able to cut them in half without issue.) Melatonin is technically only available only on prescription in the UK, hence why no UK sites stock it. You can still order it from abroad though - the trick to not waiting 3 weeks is to try to order it from Germany rather than the US. Plus I paid extra for express delivery, so it should be here in a couple of days.@Karen - Thanks! Not to continuously bang on about melatonin (at least it's helping you guys fall asleep, right? <_<), but I decided on a low dose for a few reasons: 1) To avoid grogginess the next day, which is more likely with higher doses;  2) Studies have shown low doses of 0.3-1mg are just as effective. The body only produces a small amount of melatonin and even 3mg is literally 10x more than the highest natural amount produced. 3) Too high a dose can desensitize the melatonin receptors and make melatonin stop working. That's less likely to happen with a low dose.You can tell I've been doing too much late night reading >.> But that said, going by the online comments I've seen, people seem to take all sorts of doses - I saw one lady who was on 60mg. Some people did say that they felt better when they reduced their dose, but others seemed happy with their 3mg, 10mg, or whatever. I think the older you get, the harder it becomes to be a \"go-getter\", especially if you are not temperamentally that way inclined. I think if I could go back in time with the knowledge I had now, I could do so much more - or maybe I'm just kidding myself, I don't know. As for the future, it's a dark, rather terrifying, blank :-/ @nssg - The book is \"Children of Time.\" After banging on about melatonin for ages, my mind has gone a bit blank now, so just look up a description on Amazon. It's my kinda themes though: space exploration, colonization, genetically engineered spiders, etc. It's actually much better written than that may make it sound, and the story is a cracker so far: unusually it just keeps on getting better and better. I'm only halfway though, so take my judgement with a pinch of salt. I don't think most people love working, really. But most people seem able to bear it considerably better than I could. (In retrospect I didn't know I had autism/ADD, but even if I had known, not sure how much difference it would have made, especially without support.) My oldest brother never likes his jobs either, but the mere fact of working doesn't seem to make him depressed. It did my dad though. Oh, boy did it my dad and didn't we all know about it (but to be fair to him, he also had undiagnosed high functioning autism. My brother on the other hand shows no signs of autism whatsoever).My brother's wife, on the other hand, loves working and would be bored out of her mind without it. Even the retail stuff (it used to be just retail, but now she does teaching as well). I can't really fathom that. I hate shops. I hate people. I hate standing up all day long and nowadays would be almost physically unbearable. Retail work would be my own personal hell, although I respect the people who do it, since I can't. I'm not sure what my point is, really. Other than people's attitudes to work, and ability to bear it, seems to vary so widely. It's sad when work takes up so much of your time and energy, you have nothing left over with which to enjoy the rest of life. Very sad. Exercise helps me to feel better sometimes, but seems to have no effect on falling asleep -  I can be physically shattered and mentally wide awake. Incidentally, sleep has a massive influence on our well-being. Trouble is, modern life makes it so hard to sleep well. I'm off to the town centre now before the shops close. It will give me a walk and a bit of fresh air, but I also need to get dinner and a couple of other things.

A walk and fresh air sounds fantastic, and it's a bit of exercise, maybe it will help your mood, energy level, and sleep. I hate nights where I don't sleep. I slept really well last night. Is it hot there? I can never sleep well when the weather is uncomfortable. Cool air and an open window help me a lot. The nights here have been cooling down enough for great sleep. That book looks interesting. I put it in my wishlist. I know my BF will give me a lot of crap if I buy a book. I always buy books and don't read them - it's pathetic. I know some people who say they \"love\" work. Actually, I used to really sort of love my job, but that was before I realized what a load of crap it is. I don't hate my job, and I love the people, I am very lucky in that respect. I just hate spending all my time worrying about work and money. It's such a chore... Back to the topic of loving work, all the people I know who say they love work really don't. One of the people I know who was most adamant about loving work recently retired and now she's totally uninterested in doing any type of work. Before retirement she was always talking about all the jobs she would take in retirement, she even went so far as to say she wasn't looking forward to retirement. Crazy how her tune has changed... I know a couple of other people who claim to love their jobs. I get it, it keeps you busy, it's something to do, for that, it's great. It's only great if you feel like you're doing something worthwhile though, and after a certain point in most positions, you will realize you're completely replaceable. Not just that, you might feel like what you're doing is pointless and unfulfilling. Corporate jobs are not fun. 90% of the time you're spinning your wheels working on something to appease someone you have zero respect for, who got their position because they know someone, and worse, the task is useless and completely unnecessary.

Didn't go far, only into the town centre and then to Waitrose café for a coffee. Afterwards I sat on a bench by the canal. It was early evening and perfect summer weather: sunny without being too hot (anything above 25 degrees Celsius can seriously jog on). I had bought a packet of 4 rolls and fed one of them slowly to the ducks and pigeons. Once I had finished the roll, a pigeon on the bench stared hopefully at me, then hopped off once it realised it wasn't getting anything else. Not sure if this was the same pigeon or not, but what happened next was hilarious. A pigeon started pecking at my ankle, including the top of my shoe, the bare bit of skin above the shoe and the bottom of my jeans. I bent down to take a look and the pigeon moved away. I went back to my phone. A few seconds later, my ankle was being pecked again. I took another look. The pigeon went away again. I went back to my phone. The pigeon came back again. By this time I was trying not to laugh and let the pigeon do its thing. After a couple of minutes it finally left of its own accord - I'm still not sure if it was trying to eat my ankle or looking for bread.While I was there a heron came over and I got a nice picture of it. @nssg - It's not ridiculously hot, but I have been too hot the last few nights. I don't like open windows: I get the noise of the traffic, people passing outside, etc. I'm also in a ground floor flat, so open windows - even on the latch - don't feel terribly safe. That said, think I'll go and open my bedroom window now for a couple of hours before bedtime: it's feeling a bit stuffy in here. I hope you enjoy the book if ever you get around to reading it. Don't worry if you don't: I won't be checking up on you <_<. I don't think my sister in law is lying about loving work. I mean, \"love\" may be a bit of a strong word in this context, but I think she is happy to go to work. My brother has always said if he could afford not to work, he wouldn't, on the other hand. Frankly, unless the job itself is intrinsically interesting or satisfying, I cannot imagine why anyone would rather be in an office or shop instead of being at home. Yes, I am sometimes bored at home, but that is still nothing compared to the infinite boredom of being stuck in an office with work so repetitive, a trained monkey could do it. Not to mention, I rarely liked office environments; often the commute was horrendous too. Even in my 20s I found a 5-day week, with 9-10 hours a day given to commuting and working, shatteringly exhausting. There were some jobs that were more bearable than others. The one I liked best was a 20-minute walk away - no getting buses and tube trains into London. The work there was a bit more interesting and varied than most, too. Sadly it was only a temporary position and it came to an end after 3 months.@Karen - Those hours at the bakery would have killed me - I've always been a night owl. But that actually doesn't sound too bad, plus you presumably got to sample the goods :p When I was 16 to 19 years old, I did a part time job at McDonald's and actually didn't mind it (full time might have been a different story though). Later on, my friend joined and we had some good times there. I hate stories of insurance companies overriding doctors and refusing to prescribe meds or increase the dose :/ It's just wrong, but that's a whole other can of worms which I'm far too tired to open tonight. Suffice to say, I know there are some US people on the UC board who get mesalazine drugs from Canada because they're much cheaper there (even with insurance). I'm not sure whether your med would be available in Canada, but maybe it's worth a look? I hope the trouble with the meditation and mindfulness is a temporary blip. I must admit, it's something I have always struggled with. Maybe 'cos my concentration is so scattered most of the time. I would love to live off the grid, but that takes skillz I don't have.

That's outrageous. Especially as they don't seem to just roll over your prescriptions from one insurance to the next, so if the prescription gets changed or removed, tough luck for the patient. Do doctors have any say over this whatsoever or is the final decision always the insurance company's? Anyway, I hope your psychologist can help next month.

People get burnt out eventually - \"compassion fatigue\" is a real thing. It doesn't mean the people who do such jobs don't care, but chances are they've been overworked and in many cases underpaid for what they do.

Beautiful, beautiful sleep.

I then took a shower, made a cup of ginseng and chamomile tea, took it to bed and started reading. The moment I felt myself nodding off I turned off the light rather than try to finish the chapter. Slept straight through from 1:30am to 8:30am, then, slightly surprisingly, another hour after that - wasn't expecting to fall back to sleep. So, the melatonin worked! And maybe the tea helped too.

I feel lucky more than anything, given most of those stories I was reading on the Seroquel withdrawal thread. There were nearly 900 replies and nearly everyone had gone through hell or was going through hell. How can psychiatrists prescribe powerful and addictive (addictive in the sense of causing physical dependency) medication so cavalierly and irresponsibly? Many people were on a cocktail of equally potent and addictive meds. And it is absolutely not necessary in most cases, as Finland found out via its open Dialogue programme. By the way, I was out with my mum yesterday and we saw a notice in a pharmacist's asking the public to please not to blame them for the NHS medicine shortages. We asked the pharmacist about it, but she was incredibly tight-lipped and wouldn't say anything. We asked her if she was worried, and she said there was nothing they could do - an odd reply, but I suppose she is already learning to get in her defensive repudiations of responsibility. (We weren't blaming her and I don't think our question even implied we were.)But that's what Brexit basically is: a collective repudiation of responsibility, beginning with the top echelons of government and working its way downwards.Okay, I'm gonna get some lunch.

I've only looked into it briefly so far and it's pretty complicated. Ginseng is an 'adaptogen', part of a group of herbs which modulate the body's stress response. And the body's stress response - the HPA axis - is insanely complicated. Ginseng seems able to both lower and raise cortisol (not at the same time, obvs). In general, it has both a stress-reducing effect and a fatigue-reducing one. But yeah. I'm a bit less keen on it now after finding this: https://traditionalroots.org/files/2015/05/bergner-dark-side-adaptogens.pdf I'm thinking of trying Indian ginseng, ashwartahganthta something (I can't spell it, can you tell?), instead. Seems to be less stimulating than panax ginseng.

It's hardly like we're doing strenuous back-breaking work. Last summer all I did was water the plants. Apparently there's a change of people at the top and they've got new insurance. So now not only does our gardening site shut every time there's 2 flakes of snow on the ground, it will also shut every time the thermometer goes above 26-7C.

Anyway, I had nothing else to do, so I got in the car and drove to Wendover. Laid down on the grass and read for a while. It would've been even better if annoying kids weren't playing in the stream at the bottom, but I didn't have the energy to get up and move. Aside from that, I did feel better today. Until I found out about Boris Johnson's new cabinet - the Cabinet of Evil™. As for Johnson, think I'm just gonna call him Trump 2 from now on. Trump 1 and Trump 2. Cute. Time for me to go to bed. I've left it a bit late tonight. So hot though (it's gonna be much hotter tomorrow apparently), and my stomach is hurting.

We aren't geared towards these sort of insane temperatures. We don't have A/C and houses are designed to keep heat, not lose it. So while it was slightly cooler out in the sticks, where my parents are, by yesterday evening my mum's bedroom was only slightly cooler than the surface of Venus. Every upstairs window was open, but there was no breeze to lift the relentless heat and stuffiness. Luckily the temperature dropped by several degrees today. Still too warm, though. Should really open a window, but I live in a ground floor flat and do not feel comfortable with leaving the window open all night.I've got in touch with a local notary about signing my documents. I suspect it'll cost a bit, but at this point I don't care - I'm getting so bored of this now! @Karen - I've got a sick feeling of dread and disgust to my stomach. This is a coup. We've turned into a banana republic, only without the bananas and we've got a monarchy. I feel so horribly powerless. A pro-Boris/pro no deal disinformation campaign has already begun on Facebook, probably in readiness for a general election this autumn. At least you guys have a real opposition. We don't even have that. The opposition parties range from useless to appalling. We are living in the worst possible timeframe. Somewhere in a parallel universe, there is a formidable remain alliance dedicated to preventing the alt right takeover of the UK and destruction of its economy. In this timeframe, the opposition might as well all give up their jobs and go home, because all they can do is squabble and grandstand amongst themselves. Plus the Labour leadership is pro-Brexit, pro-1970s style socialism, anti-reality. I'm a lifelong Labour voter who won't vote Labour anymore, because it's been hijacked by the clueless, witless hardliners. Apologies for the rant - I'll shut up now.@Trina - I'm sorry you had to give up work. It sounds like you were good at your job and enjoyed it. It must have been difficult to accept.

I've done 90mph on the motorway in my rust bucket a few times (at 100mph it would probably judder apart). Reckless driving can be a sign of depression, in the sense that if the person stops caring about what happens to them, they are more likely to indulge in risky behaviour. If they are numb, it may make them feel something briefly. If they have low self esteem, they may even feel like they deserve to get hurt. However, if the reckless driving was an isolated incident and not part of a wider pattern, then your son probably just liked fast driving. Many people do :/ I'm so sorry you and your husband aren't talking. It sounds like both of you are dealing with your son's loss in different ways. It's really, really hard when one person wants to talk about it, and the other person doesn't. We were at a family BBQ recently. The subject of my deceased brother came up. My mum started to get visibly upset and my older brother was obviously uncomfortable. My mum quickly changed the subject, but honestly, I just thought what an ***hole my older brother was at that moment. He didn't actually say anything, but he didn't have to.My mum doesn't bring up my brother a lot to me anymore, but when she does I let her talk about it.

Unfortunately, I passed multiple kidney stones and the excruciating pain, stress and lack of self care got me depressed. Not to mention, I lost 3 family members, all on the same day. My depression started of being severe with severe anxiety, now it is more moderate and my anxiety is completely gone! So that’s a positive and I am improving. I try to be as hopeful as I can be. Unfortunately depression runs in my family, so that could also be a factor. I started off taking escitalopram (20mg), I suffered with the side effects but I pushed through and it made me feel better around week 3. However, the more I took, the more confused and dizzy I became so I stopped cold turkey. ( no withdrawals at all). I went on to take Bupropion, which worked- other than I had slight mania- but after 10 days I developed an allergic reaction(swollen face, severe sore throat). Stopped cold turkey, other than diarrhea I was okay. Per my psychiatrist’s suggestion, I tried duloxetine, which gave me an allergic reaction ( swollen face, severe sore throat) over night, so I stopped that. I have a pretty good team of professionals (2 psychologists, 1 psychiatrist, 1 GP and a loving family  ) lined up, but we just don’t seem to find what I need. Does anyone have any experience with allergies to antidepressants? How long did it take to find the right medication? And what did you do to keep yourself encouraged during the trials?

I don't know a lot of medications by their generic name, so I need to look these up so I know what you have taken and haven't.  Not that I would be any help anyway, but I am curious as to whether you have tried only SSRI's or SNRI's.  I have better luck with the SNRI's.  Not as many side effects.  I have taken bupropion before.  I needed a high dose and it gave me insomnia.  But I didn't have any allergic reactions to any of the medications, just bad side effects.  Being that your anxiety is gone, that is a real good start.  Anxiety really can effect us in bad ways.  I am glad that yours went away.You have been through a lot.  That is no doubt.  But as you said, you have a real good support team and I believe that in time you will get the right medication.  I tried many before I found what worked for me so I know how frustrating it can be.  But you will get there.  I take Pristiq.  Before that I took Effexor for about 15 years.  I have been on Pristiq since 2010.  I take abilify also and as needed Xanax.  My anxiety isn't what it use to be but it arises from time to time.Keep working on things.  You will find what is right for you.

I don't remember the authors name, only that she claimed to be in communication with those that had crossed over.  I have no opinion, one way or the other, on the subject BUT one thing she said that stuck with me...the manner of death ceases to matter to the one that died, once they have died.  It only matters to those left behind.  She claims that each of them wants each of us to stop focusing on the manner in which they died.Giving myself something to think about instead really helped me.  My father was alone the day he died.  No one knows exactly what happened.  The neighbor tells us that he was alerted to something being wrong because the dog was out loose.  We'd always kept her on a line, even though the yard was fenced, because she would jump the fence.  Yet, here she was, out of the yard!  Running in circles as the neighbor got out of his car.  When he brought her home, he saw the front door open and my father on the floor.  We can only assume he knew something was wrong and had let her out in hopes she would get attention.I struggled for a very long time over that day.  Mother had gone to Delaware to visit her Mother.  I had been at church that morning and was to look in on Dad afterward.  I blamed myself for staying on after service, chatting with other members.  \"If only...\" dogged my every waking minute and kept me from sleep.I cannot tell you that 'It gets better'...only that at some point, it stops consuming us.  The days drag, but the years fly by.  I don't believe anyone is ever really 'gone'.  I've felt my Dad's hand on my shoulder.  I've smelled his cologne mixed with the smell of lighter fluid (he carried a Zippo in his pocket most of his life).  An unusual combination, not likely to be randomly duplicated.  Always when he wanted to 'tell me something' or more to the point 'remind me of something he'd taught me'.  I grow lilacs for my Mother, red roses for my Dad.  They help me.  Perhaps planting something for his memory will help you, too.  These plants are not green all year.  They bloom for a short while and then they slumber...only to return again when the time is right.

I saw the grieving part. I didn’t quite catch on to the legal side of this.   You said on 5-8-2019:“Coroners report was inaccurate and based on assumptions “Does anyone know what type of person I should contact to pursue an investigation for lack of a true investigation of accidental vs suicide or possible homicide?“It’s not the Police“They refuse to give me the report.”One person said, “Maybe a lawyer? They have private investigators they use for cases. Or at least they may be able to direct you in the way to go.”Another said, “I agree with Kathy, a lawyer or private investigator. You need closure for this. Therefore you need to know what exactly happened.”-----------------------------------I agree with the suggestions. I’ve had two experiences with this. One, a woman I know needed a lawyer to help with a false charge by police. Turned out, there was no false charge, she was guilty. But I didn’t figure that out until after I had tried to find her a lawyer.So I did learn about “harrassment” type lawyers, which I also needed because of some bad neighbors, but I didn’t have the inner strength for all of that, but now I have the knowledge of that. For someone else, I typed into the search engine, “lawyers for my hometown.”  Went through the listings looking only for the type of lawyer I wanted. Harrassment. You can look for whatever the category you might be interested in. In another situation, because of neighborhood problems, I wanted a private detective. I did that on my own. Same thing, typed into the search engine, “detectives for my home town.” I wrote down 4 or 5 or 6 names, called a few until I got to one I liked. Then, the problem stopped with the neighbor, so I didn’t need the detective. But that’s what I would do in your case. I would get a lawyer who handles the type of matter you are concerned about. If you want a female lawyer, they’ve got those. That was my first choice, also.A lawyer can then perhaps recommend a private detective. If she doesn’t and you still want one, you can still get one on your own. I would first talk to the lawyer. She can tell you right over the phone whether she handles that, and what she might or might not be able to do. The phone call is free. Once you get a few names from the computer, calling and talking to her is very easy.I’ve seen these kinds of cases on TV where the police/coroner get these things right sometimes and they get them wrong sometimes. A lawyer can get the police/coroner’s reports better than you can.       ----------------You said you had already talked with one lawyer and \"He said there is nothing he can do- I have to deal with the police and if they won't co-operate contact the District Attorney.\"Well, maybe get a second opinion. You don't really know how accurate the first person is until you talk with a second or a third. You have nothing to compare it with. I would get a second lawyer's opinion and see what she thinks. And you can get free 2nd and 3rd opinions as you go down your list of lawyers that you choose from all the others on the net listing, and get their free opinion right there on the phone.Post Edited (Tim Tam) : 6/10/2019 5:58:34 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "6/9/2019 3:52 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "pitmom", "comment": "(((Weary))) Just want you to know I'm thinking of you and keeping you and your family in my prayers.", "commentTimestamp": "6/14/2019 3:43 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "wearyRAsufferer", "comment": "In the depth of despairSpend my nights crying listening to sad songs about loss on YouTubeOne after the otherSipping on vodka til I feel I can go to sleepHave a pillow someone made me from my sons pillow with a favorite t shirt sewn over itI hug it all night while I sleepIt’s good to come here and know that you all care and are praying for me and sending positive thoughtsI thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart", "commentTimestamp": "6/14/2019 5:38 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "So sorry Weary, it all takes time.

You said you are on 300mg daily for years, that is scary. Why would one need such high dose for years?I have depression/major depressive disorder for the last 5 years. Undiagnosed and untreated. I just started the treatment 3 weeks back. Also taking SNRI for serotonin and norepinephrine. My mood is good, and subtle improvement in norepinephrine memory attention sharpness. My arousals and desires, engagement in desires, deriving pleasures those functionalities are dead. That is the main problem.  I guess depression of many years changes/lowers the receptors in the brain. Taking Tyrosine and other supplements does not help. Bupropion is a receptor agonist, I wonder how long it takes to restore normal receptor density and activity.

I do have episodes of major depression but it is still different than classic major depressive disorder.  It is not going to go away, sort of like any other chronic disease.  300 mg of bupropion is the most common dose, 450mg per day is the maximum dose.  I have not suffered any consequences from being on this for the last 17 years.  Bupropion is also one of the few antidepressants with few to no side effects regarding intimate relations.Depression is a multifactorial disease: it doesn't have one specific cause. The reasons for a decrease in the neurotransmitters is not specifically known.  There is a decrease in the specific receptors in the brains of people with depression and I don't know if that can be reversed.  The question is sort of like the \"chicken and the egg\" - which came first - the depression or the decreased transmitters?  That is why medical treatment focuses on increasing the amount of neurotransmitter available by blocking it's reuptake and sort of flooding the remaining receptors. Many people with major depression do recover and only take antidepressants for months rather than years. So take heart.  And also remember, that since depression is a multifactorial disease, it has other treatments that are just as effective as medication (especially when used in combination) such as talk therapy and exercise)  I strongly suggest that you do one or both of these also.I hope this helps and wasn't too preachy.

I need some advice and frankly I don't have anyone to talk to very comfortably and it has been on my mind for a while now so... here goes nothing! I have a boyfriend of a different race and religion for a few years and when we first started frankly he wasn't very good to me. He was very unwelcoming when I came over to his place, every cent counts when it comes to bills whether it's for food etc, always wanted me to shut my mouth around his parents. But for some reason I stuck around like glue, which I admit is very stupid of me. I confronted him and he started acknowledging and started to change until recently he thought it was fine to go out with his friends constantly, who nearly always talks bad of me. They always say things like 'oh why is she so clingy' or 'don't you want to find some other girl?' But they pretend to be nice towards me. I was super offended and confronted him, but the first thing he did was argue and tried to convince me that I was just overreacting and that he just wanted to go out and have fun with his buddies. It took 2 nights of my anger for him to realize. Now, he seems really regretful of all the things he has done and really is keen to change. But my family is also rather conservative thus the differing race and religion is a real issue as well. Needless to say, my family is quite discouraging. I've talked to him about religion and he said he's willing to convert for my sake once marriage rolls around, though I'm so afraid that he would change his mind when we're too far into our relationship. I'm so afraid that after marriage, he would change. Or if he can't live up to his words. Yet, there's something in me that keeps on coming back to him. Like the way we are able to share everything to each other, which nobody else has that sort of relationship with me. So I'm just walking in the dark, and in fear. Please, I need advice. What should I do? Should I break up with him for my family's sake? Should I continue this relationship even if I keep on losing faith and trust? I'm so confused.

Take it one day at a time, and don't rush into anything.  Like I say it is give and take.  When he is with his friends find things to do that you enjoy.  You don't want to get in between him and his friends.  He will grow to resent you if you do.  Talk to him calmly maybe about limiting some of his time.

Crutches, brace, the whole 9 yards!I made it worth my while and stopped at a store I like, briefly.  On the way home, she asks if I could take her later, to see her stepmother in the hospital, her step sister is coming up from Kentucky with the kids.  Not thrilled, I say 'Ask me later.'  Well, a good hour and a half before 'sister' is supposed to be there, she comes out of the house, no brace...and tells me she'll drive herself, since I didn't seem thrilled earlier.Now, I'm downright ticked off!  I dropped everything the other day to take her to the ER.  Dropped what I was doing this morning to take her for her check (which I never see any money from).

My parents made me drop out of school after junior high. I dealt with a bit of social anxiety but came close to making friends toward the end of 8th grade. Since I left school, I’ve never had any friends and rarely get to leave the house. I did very well in school, and I know I missed out in so many opportunities. A great high school here invited me to apply and I would have taken AP classes, been on the math team and all. Lately I’ve been feeling pretty depressed about it, not to mention pretty lonely. I should be graduating this year and as I look back, especially when I hear from other kids graduating this year about all the amazing things they’ve done and great times they’ve had, I realize that time went by so fast and I’ve done nothing. I’ve become really irritable, It’s really hard to get up in the mornings which is unusual for me, and I feel strange, sort of like I have no energy all day or desire to get out of bed in the morning, especially knowing I have nothing to look forward to but sitting at home and dealing with my parents who argue constantly and sort of use me as a pawn in the process. I could get my GED, but I have relatives that took that path and never got anywhere with it, and I’m not sure I’m ready for university. It’s tougher to make friends there, there is more stress, and I’m not sure It’s the best place for me right now. I have the opportunity, though, to go to a good high school here if I can test into senior year, which I’m confident I can. With a diploma, I could also apply to better universities and maybe get into a math/physics related program which I am interested in doing. I’ll be older than most of the other kids there, though (the closest is a senior who’ll turn 19 a couple months before the end of the year). Do you think I’ll be looked down on? Can I make friends and make up for what I missed out on? What would you do?

Tired of the uveitis, tired of the Crohn's, tired of medical appointments which never go anywhere, and tired of fear. Lost hope of having a better life or of meeting anyone new. I can't talk to people in this state, so I don't. I think the uveitis was the final straw which broke me to be honest. I now have panic attacks about going blind - a worry I did not have until a year or two ago. If I could see a decent eye doctor who could either convince me I won't go blind or get me onto some treatment other than steroid eye drops (which in their turn can cause sight-threatening complications), then maybe, just maybe, I would feel like somebody was on my side for a change. instead of me battling indifference everywhere I go.

I saw the ophthalmologist today and she was actually a lot more helpful than the private doc I saw for £340 - I still feel mugged tbh. But anyway, she did manage to allay a few of my worries about the cataract operation. Apparently steroid-induced cataracts are a lot easier and safer to remove than uveitis-induced ones (my ones will be steroid-induced, because I haven't had the uveitis long enough to get cataracts from it). So at least that's one bit of good news. Everything else is about the same. One drop at night time seems to be keeping the inflammation under control for now. I have known it flare up even with one drop a day, so I'm not going to risk stopping the drops. Certainly not before the op, where it's important for the eye to be inflammation-free. The ophthalmologist did say that the operation would cause the uveitis to flare up, which didn't surprise me - the body doesn't like being cut into, no matter which part it is. But I guess steroid drops will deal with that... @Buena76 - Yes, cataract operations have improved enormously. There's far fewer complications from them than there used to be.

This will be a short reply, because once again I've stayed up too late playing Xenoblade Chronicles on my 3DS <_<. I had to give up playing Geometry Dash because it was starting to really hurt my hand and forearm and it was getting worse, not better. Both my arms are sore, but it's worse in the right arm and radiating down into my hand, making it a bit numb and tingly. Using the laptop isn't helping either - I tried an ergonomic mouse but it didn't make much difference unfortunately. This has gone on for several weeks already. I wasn't going to go to the doctor about it, but I think I will soon if it gets no better... I honestly don't think there's a bit of me left which isn't falling apart. Toes maybe. I think my toes are still okay. I also finished the 5th and final book of the Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy series, so I've been managing to fit in some reading too. To be honest, I can't understand half the plots I read/watch nowadays, let alone think them up :-( I was fine until the very end, but there's something I still don't get about it and it's bothering me. It's bloody annoying to get through 5 books and then not quite understand the ending. My brother (the one who died...) was an aspiring writer too. I still intend  to read a book he wrote called Boris Goes To The Supermarket. It was on the Amazon bookstore - I downloaded it for my mum onto her kindle. Unfortunately I think it's gone from Amazon now, although if has I can always copy my mum's version over to my kindle. That's not the problem. The problem, for both of us, is reading it. We think it's going to be pretty depressing... :/ I am sorry about your meds. Would your doctor get in touch with the insurance company and say you need these particular meds? Are they giving you a cheaper alternative or stopping your meds completely? I ended up writing a long post after all. Oh well <_<. I am going to be off to bed after this though.

One good thing about here is that when you start a med, you can usually stay on it permanently - there's no insurance company to mess around with dosages, etc. However, not all meds are equally available. Medications are only licensed for particular conditions and getting a medication prescribed off-label seems to be virtually impossible, e.g. Wellbutrin for depression, biologics for my type of uveitis. Plus getting a GP to prescribe sleeping pills or tranquilisers is harder than getting blood out of a stone. Anyway, I spent the day at my mum's friend's house yesterday. Her ISP had sent her a letter saying that her husband's email may have been used to send spam, thus they were blocking all her email accounts. Her husband sadly died 3 years ago of cancer. What an absolute nightmare it was trying to sort it out. Endless phone calls, endless waiting in queues with some of the worst pop music I've ever heard in my life, endless being passed from pillar to post. And after 2 hours of this wretched crap, the problem wasn't even sorted. Apparently the IT team will call back within 5 working days to sort out a new password and will delete the husband's email accounts in the meantime. I give it 50/50 it will happen. The second problem was luckily a million times easier to solve. Someone had enabled Audio Description on her TV by accident and the voiceover had been driving her mad for the last 1-2 weeks (she was a bit vague as to when it started). Neither she nor her lodger could work out how to get rid of it. Once I knew what it was, it was easy to find and switch off in the TV settings. Then I found the TV remote shortcut and showed it to her, in case it happened again and she needed to know how to switch it off. She thinks I'm a technological genius, when I really am not. I just know how to find my way around menus and decipher them :-/ @Karen - Very glad to hear that the drop of dosage doesn't appear to have done any harm. It's always a bit of a risk tapering or stopping antidepressants, so I'm glad it didn't affect you adversely. @Trina  - Thanks. I am still worried, but just trying not to think about it for now I guess. I can worry about Brexit instead. It's the EU elections tomorrow , so I'm going to vote Green. Tactically, voting Lib Dem would probably make more sense, but it turns out I can't forgive the Lib Dems for their collusion with the Tories in government after all. I am so angry about what has been done to our country. The report by the UN special rapporteur, Philip Alston, into poverty and hunger is absolutely brutal. And what makes it worse is that the government is still gaslighting the entire country and denying everything the UN report says. When you only have to open your eyes, read a few things and talk to a few people to see the UN report is true and the government is lying. Meanwhile, the PM is on the brink of being forced out. The only way she is leaving is being dragged out of Number 10 with a bottle of gin, so the Tories are voting to change the leadership rules so that she can be subjected to another vote of no confidence and forced out that way. She was subjected to one last December, won it, and was supposedly immune to another challenge for 12 months. This country has turned into a basketcase. Today, a man was caught on video at a Brexit rally shouting \"***ing traitor\" over and over again at a remain campaigner (who was standing with a placard and wasn't harassing anybody). He poked the remainer with a Union Jack flag on a pole and then went and screamed \"losers!\" at a bunch of other people offscreen. Later on, he was identified as being the senior mental health lecturer at King's College University. That broke me a little. Sometimes there are no words to express the deep down awfulness.

If I hadn't had the same experiences you've had, I'd feel even worse.But I have had the same experiences. I'd had six years plus getting misdiagnosed as a depressive when I was really manic-depressive. What would happen would be the anti-depressant would send me into mania and then panic attacks. Then I guess they would treat the panic attacks, which were caused by the medicine they gave me to begin with. Or, they would ignore the panic attacks and say, \"Well, what was going on when you had the panic attack?\" as if it was my fault, or the environment did it. If they miss-diagnose, they miss-medicate. If they miss-medicate, you're not really being treated, you're being miss-treated. Which is why the diagnosis is so important.With computers and people being able to go to the net looking up such topics in the search engine as \"depression\" or \"manic-depression\" (now called bipolar) or \"anxiety\" or \"post traumatic stress disorder\" (PTSD) or any such physical or mental ailment, doctors aren't the only ones who can try to determine what condition a person has.And doctors have from 5 to 20 minutes or so to figure it out. Patients have all the time they want, from an hour to weeks if they want looking on a computer, printing out items of interest. They can even print out the symptoms of bipolar or depression or anxiety or whatever, and on the printout check off the symptoms they have to see if they quality for that illness.They can even take the printed out sheet to their doctor and show him or her what they and the doctor think. If the doctor doesn't agree, they can either discuss it or the patient can even get another doctor if the patient thinks the doctor is n ot the right one for them.   Doctors being the only ones who decide such matters went out with the era of men-only doctors, which was decided on by who, men, right, that makes sense, to male doctors. But men and I suppose women psychiatrists are still making the same mistake of diagnosing patients who come in as depressive as depressive, without asking one question, \"Do you ever have a racing mind. Do you have trouble sleeping?\" to see if they are manic-depressed. As far as computers, I was at the public library yesterday, and they have plenty of free computers. All you need is a free library card. You can look up various mental conditions on the search engine. The assistants will show you how to do that. You can then print out any pages you want, which the assistants can show you how to do.Going through 18 different anti-dep pills when your problem was actually bipolar is very said. In addition to my anti-dep., mirtazapine, I also take Lithium as a mood stabilizer, which keeps my anti-dep from throwing me into mania or and/or panic attacks.

Back then before I knew I had Lyme it was more of an exhausting feeling. The fatigue I have had for the past ten years is different. Maybe it is from depression but back in 2010 when it started I know I wasn’t depressed.I had successfully treated Lyme...working part time..traveling ...living my life.Then gradually the fatigue crept in and became more and more debilitating. Over the years I also became intolerant to noise...light...crowds...malls...restaurants. I would get very overstimulated. I can’t have night activities because I am too tired. Shopping is exhausting....I have trouble on the computer and watching television...the sound and movement is stimulating. Insomnia since 2004.I am under the impression that whatever causes all this has given me depression because it’s been so long. I know I failed the depression questionnaire but I am very frustrated that I can’t do things...not that I don’t even care I can’t. I could go on and on.... I have read depression causes wicked fatigue but have never read where it causes all my other major issues so I just don’t know if antidepressants would even help. I guess that’s up to the doctor to decide. I am possibly depressed but also could have CFS? I have some meditation apps on my phone and will check yours out too.

Then she decided she didn’t want to treat me and told me to see a psychiatrist that also specializes in medications. I can’t get in until late June. I called my PCP and she also had me fill out the questions about depression and I scored a 16 (5 or less means not depressed) I asked if I could try something while waiting for my appointment and she gave me Prozac since it was one of the “good” ones on my test. After five days I hadn’t horrible GI problems so I quit. Now a few weeks have passed and I am going to give it another try and hopefully tolerate the side effects since I really need to do something now ...I just wanted to say that the genetic test was pretty accurate because the meds that were negative I had tried some and they were really bad for me.

Zyban is suppose to make cigarettes taste bad.  Well the Wellbutrin made everything taste bad that time.  Probably because of taking a high dose.  I do have an option to try it again with the Pristiq, but at this point I don't think I need it.  I have chronic fatigue from fibromyalgia and I take Adderall for energy.

Every year just seems to get worse, especially when I started at a university last year. I am a psychology student so I find myself relating a lot when the classes discuss depression and some hints of anxiety. The more I ponder, the more I feel like it relates to how I feel. I used to be a straight A’s and B’s student until around junior year of highschool. I slowly become more lazy and cared less and less about my grades. I had become content with just getting by. Since graduating highschool, that trend has continued and now I am to the point of failing college. As much as that hurts to admit, I find myself not really caring either. It isn’t that I’m not interested in the material. I love what I study but I have no motivation to do anything with my life. I am a very avid Gamer but even that has become biring and I find myself not enjoying that like I used to. I just lay around, and don’t want to move. I’ve always been a lazy individual but not to this extent. I used to go to work all through highschool, always on time, enjoyed going most days and making money. I cared about my grades for the most part I suppose. Now I just want to sleep and do nothing. Im sitting here and watching as my lack of motivation is causing everything to crumble around me. This bothers me and it causes me sadness but I just can’t find the motivation to act on it. I need to help myself but I can’t make myself. The worst part is seeing the disappointment in my parents. I despise letting them down and I can read it in their eyes every time they have to hear about my grades sucking or how I’m failing to do basic things like going to class or going to work on time. I feel needlessly tired all the time. I can sleep for almost 8-10 hours and still want to continue. I no longer hang out with any friends, not that I really ever did that much anyway, always been a real home body but I find myself watching my friends go out and do things that I would like to do but I always find myself refusing and deciding to just stay in my room. I always think to myself “what’s the point, they don’t think the way I do and I doubt I’ll meet anyone else that understands or accepts my views on stuff. I feel incredibly lonely I guess. At this point, I feel like I’m just rambling and I doubt anyone reads this far. It does feel nice to write out my thoughts though so I guess this is serving some slight purpose. I don’t really feel like I have anyone to talk to. I feel like therapy is the way to go and being a psychology student, instructors drill it in our mind that it’s fine to go but the though scares me. Sounds dumb since I plan to possibly being a counselor or therapist myself. I love the thought of helping others, but I don’t think I’ll get the chance if I don’t take the initiative to help myself. But even with that in mind. The financial issues, failing of classes, lack of wanting to do ANYTHING and overwhelming feeling of being alone is just too overpowering to pick myself up under. I don’t know what I’m seeking by spouting my thoughts here, I feel like I know what I need to do, I just can’t mind the willpower to act. Maybe someone can read and relate to how I’m feeling, at least they can feel like they aren’t the only ones. Am I the only one in this endless cycle of disappointment and failure, only to make myself feel worse as it continues to get bleaker.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 4/30/2019 4:38:42 AM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": "4/29/2019 11:19 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "Hi Jukebox,I gave your post paragraphs to make for easier reading.

We've had a few ER visits and 1 inpatient recommendation that was for about a week stay.  He's been seeing a therapist, which has been going very well and taking medication to help with the depression.  about a month and a half ago, my husband found an ice tea can that was actually something to hide things in.  My husband texted me and said he found weed in it.  When I spoke with my son about it, he said there was no weed, but there was a pipe and a lighter.  I had a talk with my son about the possibility of him smoking and that I knew I couldn't stop him from doing so.  He admitted to me that he had before and that he feels that it helps him with his symptoms of depression and anxiety.          My husband, who is his step-father, was obviously furious when he found that can.  He was upset that he brought it into the house.  When I had the talk with my son before this incident, I specifically told him that under no circumstances is he allowed to bring anything like that into the house.  During the talks my husband and I have had, he's more upset about the fact that he brought something into the house and he believes can risk his 2 sons from being allowed to come to our house if his ex were to find out.  I briefly spoke to my son about the situation because I thought we were going to sit down as a family to discuss the matter so I didn't go into much detail about anything.       Fast forward, it has been about a month and a half and my husband has not said 1 word to my son about anything.  And when I say anything, I mean anything.  He has not spoken to him AT ALL.  For about the first 3 weeks my son didn't want to come out of his room.  He didn't eat dinner until we went to bed because he was afraid of what my husband might say.  My husband noticed he wasn't coming out of his room and he said it was probably a good idea because he would blow up at him.  My son finally made the decision that he wasn't going to hide in his room anymore and he now comes out to eat when dinner is actually ready.  He pretty much went back to acting like things were normal, save the fact my husband refuses to talk to him.      Now it seems that it's at the point to where if my son does anything wrong, my husbands mind goes back to finding the can and gets frustrated all over again.  My sons likes incense.  He has for quite some time.  The other day he was burning one and my husband automatically jumped to the conclusion that he is only burning them because he wants to hide the smell of weed.  I went into his room and didn't smell anything that smelt like weed.  It's a pretty distinctive smell.  My son and I went to the store and my husband text me saying \"House smells like weed.  I need to know if he had it in the house again.\"  I showed my son the text and he told me no, that he hasn't brought anything into the house.  He even admitted to me there was no weed in can, just the pipe and lighter.  My husband even admitted that he didn't even look in the can, he just opened it and smelt it.       I'm sorry for the long post, I just feel that I'm caught in the middle because my husband won't even talk to my son about anything.  They've had a pretty good relationship up until this point and I don't want this to ruin it.  I'm trying to being understanding on both sides of this, but I do feel like if it were his 14 year old that did the same thing, he wouldn't give him the silent treatment for over a month.  Yes, he would be upset with him, but he wouldn't be giving him the same treatment he's giving my son.  I want to bring it up to him, but part of me is afraid of what his reaction will be like.  He's a pretty stubborn person and almost has the mentality that it's his way and his time or nothing at all and gets pretty frustrated when it's not.  Any help would be so appreciated.Thank you for taking the time to read.", "commentTimestamp": "4/24/2019 11:57 AM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "Is marijuana legal or illegal where you are?  It is legal here in Michigan.  But I think the legal age is either 18 or 21, I am not sure.  I have a medical marijuana card myself.  I think with your husband and your son's relationship, you may just have to let it take it's course.  You can't make them get along.  I think your son is willing but your husband is not.  I would just go with the flow of it for now.  You could try to get them to go to counseling maybe???  Again, I think your son would be more willing than your husband would.  Your son is 14?  I do admit that marijuana helps with depression.  Some people it helps with anxiety and some it makes worse.  Though your son says it helps his anxiety.  But I do agree on the depression.  Though I think counseling will help your son a lot.  I take medications for depression and anxiety too.No, you cannot force your husband to go easier on your son, but I think in time he will.  How old are his sons?  I am sure that they aren't perfect.  But I can also understand how he feels about being able to see his kids too.Your son isn't going to bring it in the house anymore.  That is what he said, and it sounds like he is honest.  I would just reinforce it with him from time to time and kind of relax and just see how things go.  Like I said, you can't change your husband or your son for that matter.  But it sounds like your son wants to get along and that is half the battle.I wish you the best.  Welcome to the depression forum.  I hope that things work out for all of you.  May I ask where your husband found the can?  Was it in your son's room?  If so, what was your husband doing in his room?  Just wondering.  Again, I really hope that things work out.  You sound like a cool person.  How does your son do in school?  Does he smoke it a lot?  The reason I ask is that he is young.  And he is learning.  Though I did it at the same age.  I am not proud of it, but it is fact.  Just make sure he continues counseling.  I think that will help him the most.Hugs, Karen...", "commentTimestamp": "4/24/2019 1:35 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "kilekine", "comment": "Thank you for your response Karen.  I'm really hopeful that things just run it's course with this situation.  I feel uncomfortable in my own home.  Which I'm sure my son and husband probably feel the same.  I totally get what you mean about how sometimes it doesn't help with the anxiety and could actually make it worse because my son has told me that there have been times it's made it worse.  He and I have a really close relationship and he's pretty open with me about things.  Where my husband found the can was in my son's room, however, my son leaves his door open when he leaves for school and the can was laying on the floor right next to his bed.  We have a no drink and food in rooms rule for the boys so my son made the \"mistake\" of just leaving it out in the open and my husband saw it.  He actually recognized it right away as a \"stash can\" because he said that he had one when he was younger.  I think the legal age in Washington is either 18 or 21, I'm not quite sure, so he's obviously not of legal age.  My son is having his struggles in school, but I don't think it has anything to do with smoking.  He's had issues years before this situation happened.  He doesn't smoke a lot from what I know.  I can't say how many times he has, but I know it's not like every day.  My guess it possibly, before this issue, around once to twice a week.  I smoked as well around his age and I didn't feel that going into full parent mode and just forget everything that I was feeling and going though myself when I was his age was going to help.  So having that conversation with him was easier since he knew I wasn't going to explode on him.I just don't know how long I should let this go on for before I say something.

I hope he isn't picking on your son with this.  Especially if he did it himself.  But I think in time he will let it go.  And I too hope that things get back to normal soon.  It is no fun not feeling comfortable in your own home.  I have had that feeling before and I truly didn't like it.  I think it makes me paranoid or not feel safe.  Emotionally I think.I don't blame you for not wanting to say anything, but if he keeps pushing and punishing your son verbally I guess, I think I would say something.

I have been reading your posts for about a month and feel like you are a great group of people.I don't have an exciting life story but I will tell you a little about myself.  I have had chronic depression since childhood.  Fortunately, I had a great childhood and a good life so far.  The depression runs in my family.  For me, the bad depression is triggered by stressful events.  For example, when I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes out of the blue without any risk factors, I went into a tailspin for several months. But I have always managed to function.  I got through school, raised a couple of kids and continue to work.  I have tried many different antidepressants and am currently on duloxetine, which is semi helpful.  Combined with therapy, I seem to do OK.  I also get a lot of help from exercise, which I am hoping to get back to in 1-2 months since I just had a hip replacement.I live in a little town in the mountains. I am married and have 2 sons, 22 and 25.  My 25 year old is living with us temporarily since finishing graduate school.  My mother in law also lives with us, along with a boatload of various pets, so we are quite a full household.  My favorite thing to do is hike.  Again, I will have to wait a little bit to restart that because of my hip and the weather.   I also like to do needlework.Right now, I am in a kind of limbo mood wise.  I am coming out of the post-op depression but now I just feel flat.  I am bored but I don't want to do anything.  I am hopeful this will improve though.

I just feel like a failure and a reject, all the bad feelings are coming rushing back. I just feel hollow and lonely. I've always felt this way, but its been a while since a depressive episode has brought all of it back. When I was younger I used to be talkative and outgoing, but after I had finished junior high I was a depressive, anti-social outcast. If I had to guess I would say this was mostly due to me being bullied for most of my school years before high school. I never really had many close friends, and it seems the few that I do have rarely stick around for long. I've never been in a relationship, I wouldn't even know where to begin one. So I've always felt lonely, like there is a piece of me missing. I've tried to fill this emptiness with different hobbies and interests but it's never more than a band-aid. Right now I feel like nobody outside my family notices me, I put on a plastic smile, gel up my hair, and dress nicely in the morning only to be invisible. I feel like I'm putting up this elaborate facade for no one, like everything I do is futile. All I want is someone to care about me, and someone I can care about. No matter how hard I try I worry I will always be alone. I don't want to wind up like my dad, who never found love until he was almost in his forties. I don't know how much longer I can put up with feeling like this.", "commentTimestamp": "4/17/2019 5:21 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "Hi Constant...First of all I guess I wouldn't care about what others think of me.  But that is me.  I am older and I don't try to impress anybody.  They can take me the way I am or not.Do you go to any therapy?  It really helps.  Are you on any medication for depression?  You may want to talk to your doc about it.You are trying and that is what is important.  Talk to your doc about medication and therapy.  See if it helps.  A lot of us go through this.  Self help tools help a lot too.  Check out our depression resources at the top of the page.  You may find some helpful information.Keep posting as it helps.

I'm not currently in therapy right now, and I don't want to go back unless I have to. I do realize though that it may become necessary soon. I've never really looked into trying anti-depressants and it may be worth trying. It just feels like therapy has been little more than a band-aid, usually I'm out of therapy for less than a year before I need to go back again.", "commentTimestamp": "4/18/2019 12:48 PM (GMT -7)"}, {"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "Maybe you just haven't gotten to the bottom of things.  I don't think I have.  But I think those things come more when we are ready to deal with them.  Kind of like repressed memories or something.  They surface when you are mentally able to deal with them.  I take medications for depression.  They help, but it took me a long time to find what was right for me.  There are so many of them.  But I have to admit they do help.  It takes awhile though for them to work good.  So it is a longer process than we would like.  I am glad you are open to therapy if you need it.  I have a tendency to not talk about things that bother me.  I don't know why I do that.  I guess because I have been going for so long.  But it is like when I get there I forget what is bothering me.  Strange.  I do that with the doctor too.  I usually write things down.

So many people go through life like this.  People you think that have it all go home to empty apts. and houses. I myself ended up marrying a Chef I. met at work.  We were friends first.  Long story short.  I was abused, surpassed it all.  Now I realized I married him be it comfortable.  He would never be home and I would not have to work on a relationship.  an like most Chefs,  [I am sure there are exceptions]. he cheated, a lot]After 30yrs of married are separated,  working back towards friends.  Who needs more enemies right?I have only started to make from friends from a support group I have been going to for 5years.  They start slow and developed over coffee,  a lunch here and there.  Some wrecked, some I shut down.  But I learned to see and feel if a person was using me for a cab service or whatever, or if we really genuinely liked each other.And I also found out that friends do not have to daily, in your face talking.  Adults and spend weeks with out seeing a person and still have a warm friendship.  Heck you can build a friendship around the world today and never meet the person, but love them all the same.   May I suggest Self compassion.  It helped me so much to challenge the negative  thoughts about myself and when that happened I realized the things bullies and others said about me were not true.  I am a beautiful and good person.  And so are you!!!At the top of this forum is a thread,  Resources.  about 5 pages of helpful information,.  on the last pages is a list of books.  Take and look and try to start loving yourself.Peace strength and hugsTrina", "commentTimestamp": "4/19/2019 12:47 PM (GMT -7)"}]}]
