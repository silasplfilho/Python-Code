Yes the bi polar swings the swings, however i control the force.I know more is to come and meaningful progress is being made. What i seek has a depth that i can now see is the enrichment to move forwards and i am. Yes more to do.It is dark....and the quiteness that karen enjoys at the crack of dawn i am enjoying now....but late at night. Not too late, however the bed beckons me.Life is a mysterious practice and i am ever practicing! Sometimes i am me and sometimes i am still me. We are same but always changing.  The here and now, the present is my focus and via this i shall gain further enrichment for other meaningful pursuits.The turtle seeks his shell. Good night. HT",

Some people are fortunate in many ways and have a quality of life that others only wished they had.  But that doesn't necessarily mean they're generally happy in life.On the other hand, their are those who have had it hard in life.  Yet many of them are quite happy.Why are they happy?One reason is because they have a balanced brain chemistry.  And the other reason is because of their attitude, their belief system.  They look at the positives in life.So if you've had it hard and are currently depressed, you can become happy even if you've had it hard.  Psychiatric medications can help you balance your brain chemistry and help make you feel better emotionally.  And a psychotherapist can help you become more of a positive thinker.",

I didn't want to make the whole dinner for just my son and I and I don't know how I would puree turkey for my mother in law. So we had steak and she had other pureed stuff. I did make a pumpkin pie.My son left this morning and the interstate was closed for most of the day so I was stuck in town. I thought about re-organizing the pantry shelves but my trash hasn't been picked up for over a week and I have no place to put new trash, so that wouldn't work.Still very depressed and stressed.Double Depression (dysthymia with intermittent MDD), Pre-diabetes, osteoarthritis both hips with replacements 3/1/2017 and 1/8/2019",

Try to do something that make you feel good, or relaxed.  When I real depressed, I listen to smooth jazz and work on a jigsaw puzzle.  It does help me. This thanksgiving I spent alone with my dog.  I could have asked at least one \"friend\" more of an aquiantance over.  But I did not feel like cooking. It was enough that I did have to pretend John and I were still together for his Mother and cousin.  We did have an arguement over the phone and via text,  over the lawn care.  In reality it was about him taking responsibility, he lives with his mom 3 mins away by car, and he wants me to text him when the yard needs tending.and he will schedule it into his calendar!Bullcrap, he gets home in plenty of time to do it in the late afternoon.   I refuse to do this, be his, whatever.   I will just have things taken care and not bother him.  So much easierPeace Trina",

All I have left is my rheumy and he can't solve everything.Will do my best to start making calls tomorrow to find a new hip Dr.  Last time (4 yrs?) it was bursitis which PT didn't help, but then a cortisone shot helped.  Earlier this year I had 5 months of physical therapy which did help... but need a new doc to say if this is bursitis or if I've developed some other horrid malady.Also disgusted that I can't loose my 40 lbs of prednisone weight.  I lost about 20 of it earlier in the year, then gained 10 back.  Trying to talk myself into 28 days of a strict keto diet to shake things up.  In general, I don't think keto is all that healthy so will not do longer than 28 days, no matter what.  I'm sure loosing a bit more weight will help my hip, even thought by BMI measures I'm not in the \"obese\" range.  First world problems, all.

However both are replaced now and all is well.your keto routine is maybe why you keep gaining back. My son lost 50 lbs on it but if he doesn't stay strict he feels sick and then gains back weight quickly. I don't think I like the diet health wise but people swear by it.Personally....no bread, crackers, sweets- I can't live like that. They're the only keeping me alive with my sadness of losing my son.Which, since I'm on the daily thread, is getting worse with every day Christmas gets closer.  It was just so senseless. Last night the global grief group I belong to did a candle lighting at 7 pm for all our deceased children all over the world. There were no local gatherings so I lit my candle in front of his picture here. My husband didn't see the point so he went to bed. He can't stay up past 6 or so- he's done trying to live in this world without his son by that hour. I know how he feels- I don't stay up much later.",

Now, both heat ducts are not covered and I've created a little 'dining area' behind the couch for the drop leafed table and the 2 chairs.  So happy I can use my table cloths again!

Then, when my daughter moved back in with me, her cats were notorious climbers, so I didn't want to risk putting it up around them.  They've mellowed a bit, so I'm seeing how it goes this year.  WOW...as I write this...Lucky has climbed up and is wending his way around the figurines!  Be still my heart!  I'm so afraid they'll be broken!The house is really coming together nicely.  The bulk of the work is done...little details and finishing touches are pretty much all that is left for now.  I can't do major repair work until warmer weather comes along, so I'll just try to enjoy the way things are for now.  One more curtain rod, a rack of hooks for jackets, hanging a picture or two and the shelf in the living room are pretty much all there is.  I'll be getting a new lamp for the living room...I cleaned the old one and now the top light hums...so I don't use it!I've started another amaryllis...Minerva...red with white streaks...and a pot of paper whites.  Lisa bought me a white Christmas cactus, too!  These should help me get through winter, I hope!  I put fresh suet out for the birds but I don't think they've found it yet.Hoping peace for everyone!",

Keep on mixing these colors and you should definitely feel the effect of mood improvement. \"This fun fact leaves no mystery to the snobby character of \"Charles\" on the series MASH! The Puritan Grinches who Banned ChristmasIn 1645, the puritans of England removed Christmas as a national holiday. In 1659, puritans of New England took their anti-Christmas fervour a step further, banning Christmas celebrations entirely. Contravention of this law incurred a penalty of five shillings, and included any person avoiding work or feasting.This ban persisted for decades. Indeed, Cotton Mather, an influential New England church leader, railed against the merrymaking so common to Christmas, saying, \"I hear of a Number of young People of both Sexes belonging, many of them, to my Flock, who have had on the Christmas night, this last week, a Frolick, a revelling Feast, and Ball, which discovers their Corruption, and has a Tendency to corrupt them yet more.\"The ban persisted for centuries, with some parts of Boston keeping churches closed as late as the 1930s.Peace AllTrina",

I use to make about 300.00 worth of wreaths and donate to the animal shelter to sell on the Christmas Walk.  We would even hang them on the walls for them and it made everything all Christmassy.

Made a beef stew so people could just dish some up whenever they were hungry, rather than set a time that might not mesh with their eating schedules.  My Mom used to buy cold cuts and rolls for Christmas so we could make our own sandwiches whenever we wanted to eat.  Same principle I guess.Lisa and her Mom will be coming down today so we can all go out to lunch.  In the past, I'd go up to them and we'd go out to dinner and I'd stay over but, now that I live alone there is no-one to care for the dogs (pit bulls, so no-one else is willing and I can't blame them).  Once they've gone back home, I'll be in my jammies, sipping got cocoa and waiting for the idiot neighbors to set off their fireworks, as they do every year, and giving the dogs their new knuckle bones to try to distract them from the noise.  Otherwise, they'll be barking their heads off!No 'resolutions' for me.  Why set myself up for failure? ha ha!  So much has changed already, and I know more changes are coming as it is!Going for a second opinion with an oral surgeon today.  I know the torus must be removed from the upper palate before I can have dentures made but...the first surgeon said he can only do local anesthesia and I cannot imagine someone using a hammer and chisel and a grinder on the roof of my mouth with me wide awake and fully aware!  So, this consultation is more about knocking me out for the procedure than it is about alternatives to removal per se.I'm also hoping this one will say the upper teeth can be removed at the same time.  One molar has been getting infected and the canine on the other side is loose and constantly painful.  I'd rather not leave them until the torus site is healed, at least another month!I'll be stocking up on soft foods and liquid meal replacements ahead of having the procedures.  I'll probably get some Benefiber or Fibercon, too as I don't think liquids will make me feel full and I don't want issues 'down below' either!Being toothless will be temporary, I know.  Still, I'm trying to prepare my ego for the blow.  I need this dentist to understand that I want to see MY smile...not someone else's idea of what my new teeth should look like.  Even after orthodontia, I never had perfectly straight teeth.  I'm a coffee drinker and a smoker, so they've never been really white either.  I'm having more anxiety over how I'll look, more than anything else!",

So you probably need time to heal.  Hopefully seeing an oral surgeon, they will knock you out.  I am sure that would be best for the procedure.  I was glad I got the denture as I always had bad teeth.  I am sure you will look nice in your dentures.  Especially if you replicate your natural teeth.  One day at a time, as you don't want anxiety about it.  I think you will be happy once it is all over with.Hang in there Pitmom, and again have a good transfer into 2020.PS the beef stew sounded good.

He sometimes allowed his Chow-Chow, Jofi, to sit in with his patients during appointments and noticed that they became measurably more relaxed.

In know way and I assuming anyone does not know this information,  I am sharing just in case, there is someone that is new to depression and the struggles and emotions it brings. Anger, has Hurt hiding behind it. If a person can do calm breathing, perhaps do a body scan, they can find the the emotions behind the anger.  Journaling can help bring out the emotions also.  Some prompts would be:What am I anger about?I can I do anything about my anger?How long have I been angry?Just write, don't worry about spelling, grammar, punctuation etc.  This is just for you.  No one else has to read it.  Keep going,  write what ever comes into your head. Leave it.   Come back in 4hrs or more,  maybe the next day, read it.  I like to make notes in a colored pen on things that stand out, connect some dots for me, or realizations that explain my anger.NEXT, self-hate.  This is a persons core belief.  You have been \"conditioned\" in some way to believe that you are not worthy of anything,   This not true.  Everyone has value. Everyone is worthy.CBT. Cognitive based therapy helps some people with this.  The Book, Mindfulness Based Self-Compassion by Germer Ph.d,   helped be very much.   Practicing Self- Compassion takes time and dedication.  It does work.  Eventually you will notice days where you feel good, happy, confident.    They come sparingly at first.   I think it will be a life time work, at least for me.But is gets easier every day.I hope this helps someone.Peace and strengthTrina",

Christmas is 2 weeks away and I\u2019m dying to feel better!  What are your thoughts on Rexulti.Only other med I have been on is Zoloft and I felt great on it.  Went off of it when I was pregnant.  When I went back on it, it didn\u2019t work.  It seems like when I stop a med and go back on it a few months later, it no longer works.I feel like I haven\u2019t tried so many meds.

I've been at this a long time and know what I'm doing. I'm much more myself without that med and recognise when I'm manic or diving. I have a well-stocked tool kit to help me.Right now - especially this time of year - I'm very depressed. Since 2013, I've lost 2 older siblings and a parent so christmas has been tough - not that it was any great shakes growing up - but this is more difficult. Work has been very trying. I work 12 hr shifts in support of a 24/7/365 Data Centre and we've been understaffed by 10 since Jan 2019. This has equated to me working over 430 hrs overtime since. It's burning me out, so I know that's part of the issue but I'm also within 3 years of retirement and been renting a house for the past 6+ years. I always figured I'd stay here till then and move to my bush property at retirement. Last month my landlord gave me til Mar 1 to move. It was simply because he and his wife want to sell and it is their house, after all.Now I need over 4000$ for first and last wherever I go. That means I can't turn down the over time as I had planned. I have 3 engine projects I needed to complete in the garage this winter - now I can't so my move to the bush is delayed further. Of course I have all the regular head aches happening - truck needs tranny work, trailer needs a rebuild, assorted tools need repair.......but I have to start sorting through 6 years of home life and decide what goes and what stays, knowing I'll end up with the bare essentials. I can't afford to move really - I just manage my current rent and it's not increased in 6 yrs - but have no choice. Every day seems a chore where only last summer I was eager at everything and welcomed the dawn. Thank you to all who read this - just getting it out here has made me feel better. Hangin in there...Brian",

My people raise my rent yearly and I am already paying well over market - but I get it, they don't rent the place for fun, it's a source of income . It's just a shame that people who can't afford to own a place end up paying more than a mortgage on a rental while the landlord does zero and collects WAY more than they need to, and we are schlepping to a job daily while they sit back and do nothing, but such is life. I was born into the wrong family!!!! Perhaps it will all work out for the best for you. You may find a place you like even better. Have you looked at any places? Three years to retirement, and a retirement home, but it's not near where you work? It's a pickle. I wonder if there's a way you can rent a room for cheaper and spend weekends at your other place if it's within easy driving distance? Sounds like you're working quite a bit though, and that does burn you out. You need to take some time to yourself. At least we have the holidays coming. That will be a little break.

No mortgage or rent or utilities to pay. Buena....yeah..one step at a time. My problem is that since 10 I've been a collector...mainly antique bottles but my interests have varied over the years. Sooo much stuff....it'll help with $ as I can sell a lot but still....I gotta sort and see what the kids want. Ahh...whatever...things always seem worse than they are. Before I found this place, I had moved 7 times in 6 years so I've been lucky. Now it's time for a change and that's as good as a rest. And this time I won 't need a big storage unit!

Everyday as soon as I enter my house I break down completely and weep and weep. Been this way twice in past years and each time ended up in a psych ward. NOT this time. When I weep, I now know why and that I will be alright once it passes. It's allowing myself the grief that sets me free. My appreciation for what life can actually be has grown exponentially over the past few years and I know all it takes to be happy is a roof, food and family. All I need right now is rest and to revisit my inner child. He knows so much more than I credit him for. Sheet...gettin' too philosophical.

Now I can see that I didn't.  But I don't have regrets.  It took a good while for me to learn about meditation though I been doing it since in my late 20's.  Mindfulness just learned a few years ago.  I think we all do the best that we can with what we are equipped with.  Though sometimes we would like to pound things into the younger generation's heads.  Ha...Have a good day and a Merry Christmas...Hugs, Karen....",

                "comment": "Hello, I am Dalia. I have severe anxiety, manic depression, and lack the ability to socialise in a normal way due to the isolative nature of my family.Growing up, I was abused physically by both of my parents and was taught that it was because I was a bad child. Although I acted up, I don\u2019t think I was ever ridiculously wild or a handful, I often had people tell my family that I was polite and very friendly. The frequent and often brutal abuse inevitably took a toll. As I grew, I began to become reliant on affection of any kind at all, I craved love without pain. This led to me becoming unnaturally promiscuous and attempting to speak to grown men when I was barely 11 years old, I was desperate and lonely. My parents found out after looking through my phone, and I\u2019m glad they stopped me but the way they handled it wasn\u2019t beneficial. I was told I was filthy, called names that I don\u2019t wish to repeat, I was hurting inside and I needed them to just love me. That much was clear, but they ignored the obvious signs of desperation for love. Not only did I have issues regarding affection, but severe trauma and self loathing after multiple accidents regarding small animals. I have NEVER intentionally hurt an animal with the motive to cause pain. I have lightly pushed puppies away when they bit me but never hurt them. There are repeated incidents in my life where an animal has died in my care, which I know some of you are judging me for. But just to elaborate, I never asked personally for these animals, because I knew that I wasn\u2019t mature enough to care for them. My mother would get animals and when she got tired of them would pass them on to me.Unbeknownst to me, these animals often had health problems and were very sickly (1 rabbit and 1 ferret). And I would wake up or come home from school to discover them dead. In the haze of confusion, my father would mentally destroy me. I was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and i was always going to \u201ckill everything\u201d. The worst trauma was when I was about 10. I had come home to my sickly ferret (Tico) laying in her cage and not moving. I cried and told my father, and in his response, he beat me with a belt and forced me to pick up her body and hold it. After I refused, he choked me and shoved my face near her body.I have always been very frightened of corpses of any kind, it traumatised me greatly. And to this day I still hate myself for what happened. Often using it as a reason to justify to myself why I should kill myself.The moments of trauma have changed me, and my psyche is altered. Last October, I was raped, by a friend I trusted and who promised me he wouldn\u2019t do anything to me because he had a girlfriend. I was so frightened to tell my parents, because they would have accused me of \u201cleading him on\u201d.Since that incident, I have been more self destructive and nonchalant. I have goaded my father to beat me, I have ran away from home, I have done drugs and alcohol, I have snuck out of the house and fooled around with many many people and started self harming. As bizarre as it seems, sleeping with people makes me feel loved, something I NEVER felt before without pain. I know I\u2019m ruining myself.I snuck a male into the house a little over a month ago, because I was sick and tired of being controlled (I wasn\u2019t permitted to go out often) and I felt like he loved me. I was very stupid and ignorant, and slept with him while my mother was upstairs. She caught us in the act and rang my father, and he proceeded to ring the police. I am 15, he is 16. Whilst I understand that it isn\u2019t necessarily legal, it isn\u2019t uncommon for people here to do it at a young age. I accepted it and took my punishment, it was understandably a very stupid and disgraceful thing to do. It wasn\u2019t the police that bothered me, it wasn\u2019t that they hit me all the time...it was how disgustingly and coldly they spoke to me. They didn\u2019t ask why I did it, they didn\u2019t ask if it was because something happened, they didn\u2019t ask any of that.They called me a prostitute and other names of that nature. And it broke me, horribly. They are all I have and they made me feel dirty, less than human. I began getting upset and thought of suicide, and they continued the verbal and physical abuse. But then they began to say I was mentally ill, that I was sick and deserved to be locked up. They said they wished they never had me and that they want me in an asylum.I have accepted that I have a mental illness, but they didn\u2019t support me at all. I snapped shortly after I can\u2019t do this anymore, I am alone and feel less than worth even so much as a kind word. I\u2019m getting worse. Last night I snuck out of the house to go for a quiet walk by myself (they had been isolating me and kept me inside the house without any form of outside interaction for just nearing 2 months) and when I came in, I was met with a cocktail of degrading insults and a blow to the head. They also made me a promise to get me an appointment with a councillor so I can open up to someone (a promise they have been putting off for a long time. I can only assume it is to protect themselves from getting exposed.) I just want help, advice and a friend to speak to. I\u2019m so horribly lonely and I want interaction so badly. It\u2019s getting worse.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 5/1/2018 1:33:55 PM (GMT-6)",

It is just too graphic and can trigger other members.I am so sorry for what you are going through.  Maybe you need to talk to a counselor.  You shouldn't be living with your parents talking down to you, calling you names and physically abusing you.  Nobody deserves that.  You know that this isn't right by posting on here.  So I would start with the school counselor and go from there.  Be careful who you bare your soul to though.  Start small and work your way up.  Having a psychotherapist would be good and a good person to talk to.  You aren't being treated right.Sleeping with men at your age isn't going to get you the love you are looking for.  You need to feel safe.  And bringing them into your home is going to have reprocussions, so I wouldn't do that anymore.  The most I can say is do get counseling, get back control of your life and move forward.I hope that things get better.Hugs, Karen...",

How your parents have treated you is disgusting; I only hope that when you're 18 you feel strong enough to move out and cut them out of your life.You show a lot of self-awareness of your behaviour, such as seeking closeness through sleeping with men etc. I'll bet you are an intelligent person.Why do you say you have never experienced love without pain? It implies you have felt love with pain, but that is not love. People that love you do not beat you or destroy you mentally. One day I hope you meet someone that can show you what real love is.I'd try to see the counselor if you can and be honest with them. Don't protect your parents, they deserve what's coming to them. Are there any phonelines where you are for people that are struggling? Here we have the samaritans and others, who you can call whenever you need someone to talk to.

You do not need to cover up for them, you need to expose them to people in authority: teachers, school counsellors, or doctors. You could do worse than printing off your post (at the library, etc.) and giving that to a trusted adult to read (or the closest thing to a trusted adult you can find). You're not quite old enough to cut your parents out your life yet, but once you officially reach adulthood that's what I recommend doing. You probably do have a mental illness but it's only because your parents gave you one: no one would escape unscathed from that level of physical and psychological abuse. At your age college is probably the best way out. It almost doesn't matter at this stage what you choose to study or where you go to: just get out, meet people your own age, and join as many support groups/see as many counsellors as you can.",

You were a confused, \"conditioned\" child.  The adults are responsible.   Having sex is normal with a person you like and when it is consensual.  Both people agreeing to it. It is not disgraceful.

They are your abuses and will not have your best health in mind.  They will minipulate the situation. I would talk with the school nurse if possible.  If that is not doable, and you feel unsafe in your home go to the closest ER, do not tell them where you are going.  AT the ER explain the situation, they will get you into crisis.   This is not the greatest place in the world, but you will be safe,  a doctor will eventually diagnosis you, get you on meds, they help find a therapist and doc  for you.

Plus had just seen my rheumatologist and she prescribed a prednisone burst pack but I didn't start it.Today did my best to just rest and eat delicious leftovers. Was too busy to eat yesterday.Did decide to put the PD report on the back burner for a bit.Never responded to the email.Let them think I gave up and then I'll pounce.",

Have you looked for grief groups that meet a little more often? I think I'd probably look for a one-on-one therapist or doctor even. It would be good to have an unbiased person to talk to about these feelings. I know what you mean about the holidays and hosting. All the work that goes into it and almost no one offers to help, it can be depressing, especially when you're emotional. It sounds like you need to put yourself first for a bit.",

I later learned that the driver of the vehicle had a suspended license and should not have been driving.I sustained a number of disc bulges and herniation in my neck and back due to the accident and had to undergo chiropractic treatment,  physical therapy and other medical treatment for one year. Although the treatments helped somewhat, I still experience intense back and neck pain; it is so bad sometimes that it hurts to move or lie down.  The accident has greatly impacted my life, and I can no longer due the exercises that I used to due. It has also caused me additional expense because I have to pay for chiropractic treatment as I have no health insurance.I got angry today due to my back pain. It literally feels like my back is going to fall apart.My mom and another person told me that I need to forgive the driver, not for his sake but for mine, but I wonder how true this is. Do you really need to forgive someone to move on? I don't think so. Yes, I still get angry at the driver sometimes, but I have accepted my new reality and 'moved on' as I really have no choice. Forgiveness can be a great release for some people and help them to move on with their lives. However, for other people, forgiveness is not necessary for healing.  I have told my mom and another person this, but they say I am wrong.  Telling someone that they need to forgive can be more detrimental for some people IMO. Thanks for listening to my rant.",

I had years of abuse from my family during childhood.  2011, suppressed memories popped.What I have learned in therapy are the following, I hope some of it helps you.  None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.  Scared their Camelot lives would be shattered. Even to day,  When I sit in stillness, I find peace.  I have no anger towards them.  I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on. I believe forgiveness is different for each person.  Maybe when that person is no longer renting space in your head, that will be it for you.I wish you Peace, comfort and strengthTrina",

She suffered severe injuries of her back, hips & internal organs. She'll never be a mother & suffers severe pain & mobility problems because of it. She just turned 18 & will never be the same again. We cannot force ourselves to 'forgive' someone. Learning about the theory of karma helped me immensely. When I understood karma, I found myself actually feeling sorry for those who've harmed me. Also began looking for 'blessings in disguise'. Many times, I've noticed when bad things happened that indeed good things, also came from it(eventually & hind sight). You're suffering for a reason. That driver is the reason. Just saying, \"I forgive him\" wouldn't help me, either. He may be suffering from extreme guilt & remorse.

The antidote to violation isn't forgiveness, it's fearlessness. The need to rescue ourselves from being violated should form a strength that was not there before. And only from that place of strength can we let our guards down, let go of the pain and anger, and heal.\"",

I spent the night in town last night because going home and coming back would have been something like 5 hours total.  And then the office closed down early today so that we could all get home before the next wave of snow came.  The snow doesn't bother me, as long as it's not windy, but spending so much time in the car gets old.  Bought diapers for my mother in law and potty pads for the dog on the way home today.  Going to the grocery store for my mother in law (and a little for me) tomorrow after my med appointment.  Work on Thursday, taking MIL to ortho in Denver to get a knee injection on Friday.

This morning I was moving stuff from one car to another, not really paying attention ( the driveway's been flat for 23 years, after all ) and I stepped in the hole and took a hard fall.  I landed on both knees and one elbow but fortunately managed to catch the bumper with my other hand before I hit my head.  Hitting your kneecap hurts like an SOB so I didn't even look around to see if anyone saw me fall (no one did).  Nothing broken but I am having trouble going up and down stairs.  On the bright side , I had on jeans and a jacket.  If it had been summer and I was wearing shorts and a Tee, I would have been a bloody mess.  I'll survive.",

Then, I dressed and went to the hardware store, got my paint, came home and got busy.  Primed the ceiling, painted the ceiling, filled the holes in the walls, painted one coat on the walls.  Tomorrow I'll get the second coat on the walls and when they're dry, I'll start moving the furniture that I can manage by myself into there.  I chose a very, very light lavender since the room is rather dark with only the one window.I have 2 tall, metal shelving units, a desk and chair, three Sterlite (plastic) dressers, a china cabinet and a shoe rack to get moved!  The shelving has to be taken apart in the living room, parts carried into the 'office' and reassembled there.  The hall is too narrow to move them 'as is'.  The desk will squeeze through, though.  I've already moved the dressers a couple of times (plastic is so nice for this) but I will definitely need help with the china cabinet.  It was my Mother's and I plan to store my linens in it.  The shoe rack is plastic, too.Then, I can get rid of the heavy computer cabinet, move the buffet and put the t.v. on that!  I've been keeping my eyes open for a little 2 seat dinette.  The place is really coming together!!  I can't wait to move my bed around and be able to walk around it...which will make it so much easier to make in the mornings!  I'm too busy to be lonely!",

So nice to be able to walk all the way around the bed now for making it...and I have each day!Got all of the furniture into the office/dressing room.  Very snug...thank goodness I'm tiny!  New rugs for the floor in there and a new pillow to go onto the chair.Changed the placement of the wire shelving unit in the kitchen.  Now it's no longer blocking off between it and the living room.  Still able to use the hook rack, now on the end, for my jacket at the front door.  New, white microwave that will NEVER have garlic crust hot pockets heated in it!!!Picked up a small, round, drop leaf table and chairs at the Goodwill to serve me for now.  Hoping to get over to the 'Antiques & Salvage' place, hoping they still have the other drop leaf table I have my eye on!My home is really coming together nicely.  I've repainted the wall in the living room and now the buffet holds the t.v. there.  Wanting to put up a long shelf for the decor stuff soon.Peace to all of you!",

I\u2019ve also been sick with Lyme disease and coinfections which cause depression and anxiety and pain.  In February my Dr decided to switch me to Cymbalta, that it might help more with pain.  I wasn\u2019t too happy to change since pristiq was still working.  Cymbalta ended up causing gut problems and I ended up becoming sensitive to all grains and could only eat protein and veggies.  After the summer we switched back to Pristiq 50mg.  Month went by and I just was feeling terrible with lots of anxiety. Oh, also, in the past few months my hubby was diagnosed Bipolar and has been manic for over a year which has been extremely stressful.  about 3 weeks ago my dose was raised to 100mg.  Still not feeling any better but know it could take 4+ weeks to kick in.  My Dr. added Wellbutrin 150 to help Pristiq work better.I\u2019m on my 2nd day of Wellbutrin and anxiety got better with 1st dose.  My biggest side effect is increased pain.  This is a problem bc I\u2019m already on prescription pain meds for widespread pain and now my pain is not controlled.  I\u2019m wondering if any of you had increased pain when starting Wellbutrin and did it go away after a few weeks?  I fight hard every day to control the pain and really don\u2019t want to have pain 24 hours a day.  Other than that, no major side effects, just a little nausea.",

I know that sleep can be a side effect but hopefully with time it will get better.Getting by... last time I went on Pristiq it started helping within a week.  Full effect took 4-6 weeks though.  It was frustrating that I wasn\u2019t feeling any effect and was just feeling horrible.  Wellbutrin might be good for you to try.  But if your combo is working for you, I don\u2019t know if I would switch.  You might want to wait till it\u2019s not working as well and it\u2019s time for an adjustment.  I just found that the two times I stopped a medication when it was working and then went back to that med, it didn\u2019t work when I went back to it.  Just something to keep in mind in case Wellbutrin doesn\u2019t work out and you want to go back to lexapro.",

Since potatoes are a veggie, I can have mashed potatoes and things like that.  Just cutting out the grains, the weight just keeps coming off!  If I want to munch at night, I have some fruit or raw veggies (carrot sticks or veggie platter). Occasionally I\u2019ll have some desert... but overall try to stay away from sweets bc of Lyme.  Love chocolate covered cherries!  They have health benefits and satisfy my sweet tooth.  You might want to try cutting out grains too and see if you get some weight loss as well.  It\u2019s is nice when an antidepressant kicks in quickly.  My anxiety was through the roof and didn\u2019t think I could take another day.Hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving as well!Hugs - Marta",

But with Thanksgiving here today, I will probably eat more than I normally would.  Not a lot of sweets but you know.  I usually walk daily but I am in Michigan and the weather hasn't allowed much.

Does positive thinking help you?  Or does something else work better for you when you're feeling pessimistic and sad?Positive thinking works pretty good for me more often than not.  But when it doesn't help me, I tell myself not to look at only the negatives in life.  Instead, I like to see both the good, the bad, and everything in between.  If I only see the bad, I'm not being honest with myself, and I'm not being fair to myself.  By seeing only the negatives in life and in my life, I'm shooting myself in the foot.",

Too many people have used that term, in an almost cult like way, to pretend that all you need is to act like everything is great and you'll get rich, successful etc. I always think of Tony Robbins So I prefer the term 'helpful thinking', and sometimes try to see if thoughts are helpful or not.The mind likes to wander, and it should. When thoughts become unhelpful, it's worth considering if more helpful thoughts can be found..For example, a thought might be that the planet is heating up and weather is getting more extreme. That thought might be helpful, or it might evoke anxiety. If it evokes anxiety, it could become a thought about how people will become more aware of the environment, and turn to cleaner ways of living or something like that.",

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder recently and have had issues with finding the right antidepressant. I'm starting to have some side effects and would like to know when they'll ease off. I'm getting a bit anxious and restless to the point of wanting to do something but can't keep my mind on said action. Is that normal? And I'm starting to have some issues sleeping. I've been on Cipralex with good success and wanted to be switched to that after I got off Luvox, but my family doctor switched me to Cymbalta. Should I have fought harder for that medication, or should I see how this new one works? I am feeling better, but I'd like to sleep better and focus.

I have never taken Cymbalta, but was curious as to how long you been on it and when the side effects started.  Generally side effects go away in a week to ten days.  Some stay with you though.  I started Lexapro a couple of months ago and recently noticed constipation.  I have gained five pounds from it.  If I don't gain anymore I will still be happy but if it gets worse, I think I will ask about another med.  I would give the medication a chance, say six to eight weeks while you wait for it to get to it's full potential.  Then you should know whether or not you want to stay on it.I hope that it works well for you.  If you are feeling better mentally and emotionally that is a good sign.Hang in there.Hugs, Karen...PS  Sorry about the serotonin syndrome.

When I get here in the US I don\u2019t have depression it\u2019s just accumulated everyday. New country,new life. My late husband past away 2016. I got married again and have a baby 2019. My mom came here for almost 5months. in someways she help me. She\u2019s old and can\u2019t stand and she can\u2019t walk longer. I have my son for almost 10months. I notice lately that\u2019s my mood is way worst. My mom left September but I feel so terrible. I talked to my doctor but he put me into counseling first because might Help with what I feel. It\u2019s been 3months I feel crapty. Went again to a new doctor because it\u2019s a military thing that every 2years the doctors went to some places. Anyways, made an appointment for my PCM, told everything what I feel he prescribed me with Zoloft 50mg and been taking it for 2days now. I\u2019m still breastfeeding my son. I didn\u2019t know it will happen to me that I need medicine. Been avoiding to take and keep denying to myself that I am okay and will get better but the more I fight for what I feel the more it got worst. I am hoping and praying I will be better soon. I\u2019m a stay at home mom, with no help with the baby. My husband is so great. He help with everything. I cried everyday, I want to get better. And appreciate what I have. Thank you for reading my post.",

                "comment": "Hi Bik31,First of all, welcome to the depression forum.  Though I am sorry for what you are going through right now.  Did you tell the doctor you are breast feeding?  Did he say that the Zoloft was safe?  It can take up to eight weeks for the medication to reach full potential but there is a chance you will feel better way before that.  If the doctor said it was safe, I would take them.  It is hard when you have to constantly change doctors.  I think it takes awhile for the doctor patient relationship to build.  Then to have to get another one, that can be unnerving.  So I understand how you are feeling.Are you still going to counseling?  If you get a good counselor it can help so much.  Another thing that helps is to get self help books on depression.  I have read a lot of them and they always help some.  You could be going through depression due to having a child.  Post partum I believe it is called.  Your hormones can go whacko and you end up feeling depressed, but that usually goes away.  Keep doing what you are doing.  Maybe get some books.  Keep posting too, it helps to write things out.I hope that you feel better soon.Hugs, Karen...",

My son is only 10months. I really want to be okay. I don\u2019t want to depend on medication. But it\u2019s hard for me right now especially I\u2019m alone in the house with the baby, my husband is working at night. He get off at 12mn. I am scared to be alone. What happen to me no one will watch my son. I really hate this feeling that I can\u2019t control my brain. Before the medicine, I feel like my brain will explode from over thinking, my neck is hurting like hell from over fatigue. Can\u2019t figure out what hobby I want to occupy my time. I am not a typical housewife That clean the house or cook. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Wish I could handle my brain.",

Maybe after you can try something else.  Take it one day at a time.  Can you get a dog to keep you company during the night while your husband is working?

Had my first baby this past Feb. the bay is happy and healthy but unfortunately I experienced some severe post pardum depression for a month or two afterwards. I\u2019m on medication and was feeling better until some big life changes- we bought a house and just had to put down my life-long dog last week. He was ill for a while but being a big dog lover and having had him in my life for over 13 years, I\u2019m feeling really down. So where I\u2019m at now- still having a difficult time with daily functions. My support system is great. I go to counseling every other week. My parents watch my daughter and my husband is great. I\u2019m on medication to help with the depression and anxiety. Recently swapped to try and better manage the anxiety. More specifically I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed with the feeling of sadness and grief about my dog. I miss him terribly. I just go through the motions for my daughter and try to keep it together to do functions of the day- make dinner, do laundry, make sure stuff gets done, etc. Sometimes all I want to do is disappear. I know my daughter needs me and her life is better with me. I won\u2019t do anything to hurt myself. Let\u2019s get that straight. But....when my husband and I get into a tift or I\u2019m having a bad day, I can\u2019t help think, wow, this place would be so much better without me. I just wish I didn\u2019t exist. Idk if if that\u2019s me talking or the depression. It\u2019s hard to say when you\u2019re in the thick of it. I don\u2019t even know if this is considered post pardum any more since I\u2019m technically 9 months after giving birth to my daughter. I mean, idk. It\u2019s been a month or so since I\u2019ve switched medications too, so I\u2019d think I\u2019d have seen a difference. It\u2019s only been a week and a half since the passing of my precious dog though. Idk. Just looking for some support and insight.",

Post pardon can last for a couple years from what I understand.  Have you to your OBGYN about it? I think this would be a great idea.   Also be 100% honest with your therapist if you are comfortable. If you are not comfortable with your therapist,  look for another.  Therapists understand clients need to click to get results and they usually do not have any issue referring you to another practice.Keep posting we are here to support and listen.

My drive faces my limits and instead of battles, now tries to negotiate for energy.HT interesting your outlook,  this last week it came to me that I try and create a literacy program at the Covenant House close to me, based on the Literacy Volunteers of America program.  Back in the 90's I was on a local branch board. The closest CH, closed down this past summer.   The other two are an hour away.   My therapist hosts a mens group ever Wed night at the one, on the other side of center city. This would make the idea easier to set up.  Will not happen over night of course.  May not even be able to present it for a while.   Possible I will need to volunteer there, let them know me first.   Get back into LVA, office close to me.  Get recertifications etc...ask if they have programs at shelters, I don't even know at this point.I keep thinking of Mother Theresa, took her 40 years to start her sect in India. Sometimes things have to be put into place.  Starting them is key.  HT knows this. Taking care of yourself,  self kindness,  self compassion is most important.  Without you being able to do what is driving you,  whatever IT is will be delayed,  depress you.  We can avoid this situation most times.We are all warriors with so much to share with others.

Many of the people I shared with over the years have passed away, a few others have just snuck away, but here I am.Mostly my Lupus is quiet -- but days like today -- low 40's, rainy, high humidity, really set off pain in my hips, shoulders, and of course general mood.  Having the heat on gives me sinus/tension headaches.I'm sure tomorrow, when the sun is supposed to come out again, will be better, but today sucks.For years I've done the gym 3 days a week plus Weight Watchers, but have been unable to loose the 40 lbs of (mostly) prednisone weight.  A couple of weeks ago I decided to add a once-a-week session of Pilates.  Boy, that may just plain be too much for my body!  Tuesday I was sweating like I was mowing in 90-degree weather.  By that evening I had fever blisters.  I guess my body temperature went up, and it started a flare - a minor one, but still.  Really frustrated today.  Anyway, thanks for reading.  Y'all have fun out there.",

Pain every day from the craziness.Weight,  I am about 40lbs over what I normally was all my life.  Part is the meds, part is I just can not do the physical things as long as I use to!  Sports of any kind is out, cycling forget it.  Speed bad, 5min. Walk the dogs, around 1 block.  Guess the ice cream does not help either, but a person has to a vice right?I am using self compassion to accept this.  I am what I am.

The managers disclosed my demographic info (my living sitch) to all my co-workers and anyone who walks into the store. The privacy of my sitch is nill when they never talk about anyone elses living sitch. If you are not sure where the mean girls go after they leave high school and college, well they work at the mall for the rest of their lives.The other day the manager had her family in to visit, I walked out of the store and they stood their in the mall lobby to say \"that's her\" and started laughing. I reported them a few weeks into the job and it just got worse and worse. I can't believe that managers of a fortune 500 company could be so petty and immature. I live with a sibling and we had to take my mom in because she was recovering from a bad illness that almost killed her. When I told some of my nicer co-workers this, they understood because they were taking care of their parents as well. The petty Bees thought that \"that wasn't the reason for my living sitch.\"The reason for my post is I'm just baffled about how to deal with this mean girl mentality when it comes to adults that have no compassion or even hearts.Any thoughts?Sucks2bsickP.S. I forgot the most horrible part. For awhile the manager was trying to piss me off and get me to quit by saying stuff like \"I think she tried to kill herself and that's why she lives with her mother.\"FYI: I have never tried to kill myself.",

I began the 300mg in July 2019 and currently am on this same regimen. The other day my nose started dripping blood randomly and it freaked me out. I\u2019ve never had a nose bleed and I\u2019m 34 yrs old. Strange. Just wanting to see if others taking this same medication have experienced similar symptoms? Thank you.",

I had 2 boxes of donations for them tooI bought 2 large bag of books, however I wrote in my journal the experience was not fun and did not find anything speacial.Today 10/27/19, I went through the books.20 in all. 7 large prints that were free, I sell them on ebay.The other 13 were special in their own way6 of them date from 1836 - 1921 I adore antique books!So, amazingly, even though I felt on auto pilot, I was actually looking for things I liked. I believe I turned my emotions to numb. I know I dissociated because it is a bit foggy, except for driving home.What I take away from this is, once I decide to get out and challenge the urge to isolate; using mindfulness may not be necessary, although it would enhance the expierence. For me, mindfulness would make it easier the next time.We all forget skills, being in survival mode takes a lot of energy and beating ourselves up is not going to make anything better.So self-compassion and mindfulness together could help us challenge isolation.PeaceTrina",

It is serious to handle alone.  So glad you reached out.  You have landed in a soft, validating and support place.   Do you have any pets?  I have always had dogs.  Had fish for a while also, but to much with the tank, filter etc...Walking helps me,  sitting the park and watching kids.   I watch baseball.  Don't follow it or any team,  I enjoy the game, the plays etc.... Most days I have force myself to do things, but once I get going I feel better.  We deserve more than we feel,  I practice self-compassion and mindfulness.I honestly would not know where I would be without these skills in my daily life.  Heck these aren't even skills anymore,  it as become a change of life style for me.  I have become more thoughtful and gentler in many ways. Here is a link I hope that will help you. https://www.mindful.org/how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/ I meditate.  There is a app INSIGHT TIMER, download on your phone.  It is free.  If you don't find something you like uninstall it.   There is music of all kinds, beginner guided meditations.  I would say it worth a lookthey are organized by categories and they also have groups. Peace and strengthTrina",

When you switch off do you immediately go back to depression or is it more of feeling you can be yourself again? That is horrible about your evaluation- sounds very unfair. Sorry to hear that. Bnotafraid- I'm glad you're feeling better coming off from months of struggle- good for you! Kids can be so entertaining- and wise beyond their years sometimes. It's always nice to see them before they've been  brought down by society's conforming structure. Hope there's still some ball games for you to watch. I'm more of  a  college football fan, only ever played powder puff.HT and Mainer- thanks for the encouraging words.",

Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener.",

I imagine that the group therapy is interesting.  I have never done group, but some others here have.  Some people thrive in that kind of setting.  I don't think I have enough confidence.  I don't know why.  I don't do good around large groups of people.I am glad you are reaching out here.  It has been kind of slow.

I thought  we would be sharing our experiences and our various ways of dealing with our demons.It was uplifting though, as depression has many facets and they all come out.   There are still a few who are shy about discussing their personal problems.  I did find a more relaxed atmosphere in the room.Each week we are given assignments. Small things we can do to cope.  This week we are going to keep a rough agenda of our activities on a daily basis.  We will review next week.So far, so good.",

Bad days good days. If they are having a bad day, it is all they can do to stay present, let alone see that someone is in stress.  Also, when a member is new, they are in stress, anxiety this is normal and most groups, let them work it out themselves. The thought behind this is, besides the welcomes, the person needs to find the strength themselves to attend.I was a facilitator for 3 years, then I was working on some bad stuff from my past and I stepped down.

This Thursday it will be the fifth week of the ten week gathering of the group exercise.  You are right about the personal problems that our moderator had, until we gave her some positive encouragement.  The individuals in the group tend to concentrate on their own state of health which is understandable.  It is interesting to watch people relax more and take part in our helping each other.In general, it is a rewarding two  hours a week which is bearing fruit.  By your post you seem to have much experience.  We all benefit from your past involvement on this site.You do fine work.  I myself would make a poor moderator, as my brain  is not up to the task.My advancing age precludes me from extra curricular activities.    I would mess up a one man parade in the desert.Cloudy (Ian)\"Everybody Hurts, sometimes\"",

It is uncanny to see the very close points of sadness we all feel and how common they are.  It is almost a textbook experience of depression.  We are all understanding our thoughts and learning ways to change things for the betterShould anyone get the chance to join a group like this I would highly recommend it.",

                "comment": "cloudy said...HiFolks.It has been a few years since I put anything forward on the Depression site,  but I have had Depression  during all this time.My depression comes and goes with no real regularity.  Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener.I would have the same problem, being attentive to everyone else and being a good listener.  I tend to be an impatient person, and while I can easily be empathetic with the struggles of someone else, I'm afraid my impatience would come through.  It is eye opening, though, isn't it, that perspective you gain when getting out amongst other people and discovering that many people are at least as sad as you are, and some are much worse, with good reason.  I often feel like my sadness is something that doesn't make sense and wonder if I am MAKING myself sad for a reason.  Many people have so much more to deal with than I do.  Keep us posted on how this group therapy works out for you, please.Denise",

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.  I have been giving much thought to my parents.  Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.  As I deal with my personal depression, I have been enlightened to some degree with this group effort.     Finding it therapeutic",

                "comment": "I'm sorry that you missed the opportunity for a heart-to-heart with your father.  That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.  But wouldn't it be so sweet if it were possible that I could get that hug I so desperately needed/need and want and you could have that heart to heart talk with your father.Post Edited (MitzMN) : 10/22/2018 5:33:04 PM (GMT-6)",

I am in my late 70's and I too have suffered periods of my upbringing and later times more dramatic and full of stress that I have overcome.  We all would do things and think things out differently if we could turn back the clock.People who tell you they \"would not change a thing\" are not being truthful.  There are always regrets over lost opportunities, lost loves, lost friends and any number of situations.  In my case I have lost close friends for reasons I can't explain.  This  in particular has happened  with what I considered 3 times in my life.  In each case these people are still alive although they live in different areas of the country.  The fact that they have all had great financial success  must be a factor.  Monetary wealth seems to cause a breakdown in shared interests and the ability to share experiences.  Although I am not poor and struggling, I don't regret being lower on the social scene.With the group therapy exercise I am presently involved in, the other people who suffer with depression also have very diverse backgrounds and an endless stream of problems, both real and perceived.  Lives that have been shattered by deaths, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and other mental problems.I don't know your personal present situation.  I hope you have someone close.  My wife is my savior.  She has learned to understand depression and how to react to my occasional outbursts of tears and depressed thoughts.  I don't profess to be religious, but I envy those who find all the answers through total dedication to a supreme being.That's enough rambling on for now.     Everybody hurts sometime.",

Everyone else has trouble sleeping without   aid of medication.  It would be interesting to know the percentage of depressed people who suffer from insomnia.  I am sure that there are stats on the subject.With the darkness hours increasing, we discussed procuring \"Sun Lamps\".  apparently they help if you have one near you in the dark.  My knowledge of these is nil.

For example  \"Emotional reasoning\", jumping to conclusions without knowing what a situation entails.   When depressed we think immediately a negative answer to any possibility of a stated fact that involves decision making.The real way to look at things is to weigh the possible negative or positive answers and come to the right conclusion.That was just an example of \"filtering\" our thoughts.We had a breakdown of one of our people today.  The person has a very complicated life, and some emotions became too much to deal with and required an early exit from our meeting.  This caused a sad reaction from the rest of us, as we felt unable to help.  We thought maybe a hug was in order, but it was rejected. We still feel we are being helped.

                "comment": "Hi there       9th session of 10We talked  in some detail about going back to work after somewhat long periods of time off for treatment of Depression. This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.   This is just an example of personalities picking and choosing which topics most applied to them.",

The general feeling is that the interaction among all present was mostly enjoyed in that we all had gained something because everyone was suffering from the same thing.  Before each get together we would greet each other with \"how was your week?\".  In general the responses were some good days and some bad.With the exception of one or two people who did not enjoy the efforts of our moderator, the exercise was deemed a success.  We had all filled out a list of answers to general questions in our first meeting.  We answered the same questions at the last and checked to see if our outlook had changed over the 10 week period.  There had been someimprovements.The next step is to have a one on one meeting with the therapist to document and evaluate our experience andget some feedback  in order help us to work on things more specifically as individuals.I should mention that there was an incident which happened during the meeting. A person in an connecting roomwas screaming loudly and had to be removed by security.  This had an effect on our group, as it was of course frightening.   One must admit that in a department treating all levels of mental illness you could expect the oddproblem.I should say again that we were provided with much useful material and web sites selected by the  departmentthat will remain useful to us.",

The organized and carefully planned subjects given from week to week, and with times to reflect on our       experiences helped a great deal.3.  in general it was a worth the effort and most of the group has had a positive attitude and would like to look     into further  classes.",

It amounted to rehashing some of the things that were discussed during the course we followed, and an update since we had not seen each other for about 7  weeks.One of our group was admitted to hospital during the Christmas vacation period.  He spent about a week and according to him, it did no good.   He felt isolated knowing that it was not easy to leave the unit even if he wanted to. I can relate to that as my psychiatrist has an office near the entrance of the inpatient unit. I have often thought how it is important that I stay well enough not to visit this place.All in all, we still think our therapy sessions was beneficial to most of us.  Those who did not share this feeling did not last the 10 weeks.  We will meet again in February.",

I do think, however, that this friendship isn't worth it if this person stop talking to you over an unintentional mistake . It sounds a bit immature to blow off someone over something insignificant. Is it possible that something else is going on in this person's life which has nothing to do with you?You should go to the harvest festival and sell your paintings. Interacting with people might cheer you up. You might develop new friendship with people you meet there Enjoy your life and have a bit of fun. Forget about John, his family, and girlfriend. Don't let them take up any more space in your mind. They aren't worth thinking about Put them out of your mind and heart. Their enjoying their lives, so you do the same.I was in a bad relationship once. I was so upset and angry and constantly thought about that person. My therapist then told me something I never forgot. She said \"...the best revenge is to live your life and forget about them\". You should do the same. Who knows...you may meet someone worthy of your thoughts and affection.And your not alone, you got your online family and friends here. I know the holidays can be tough, but try to remember that it's just one day. Maybe you can volunteer somewhere on the holidays.

If I want to continue to see him it will be 120.00 a visit.  I might be able to get reimbursed through Medicaid but I kind of doubt that.  Plus I have to come up with the initial 120.00.  This is for diabetes.  But I am going to see if my pcp can prescribe my medications.  I can get blood work done at the hospital I think.I sure do hope that things work out.  They say where one door closes another one opens.  I hope for both of us, some doors open.  It really stinks when things go wrong.  Just keep hanging in there.  Don't give up.  I wont either.

He can probably do your blood work too.  Did you know there is a new gadget that can do your HbA1c right in the office, like a glucometer? But It's hard to have to give up a doctor you have been seeing for awhile. Jamie, what do you mean when you say you are going to have a \"Captain Cook\" at the gym? Are you happy spring is coming?

I sure would like an indian summer.  I remember many years ago on opening day of deer season (November 15) a group of us sat on the ground in an open field eating lunch with no coats on.  It was so warm that day in November.  I also remember a 70 degree day in January once.  My grandmother said it once snowed in July.  So you never can tell.  I just wish for a more mild and shorter winter this year.  It would be nice, but I guess we just take what we could get because we can't change it.  (though climate change but that is another story all together)I hope you have a good day to enjoy also Mike.  Maine can get cold too I understand.Hugs, Karen...",

That said, I've never had a flu shot and don't really plan to get one.  Haven't had the flu since I was a child (long before flu shots became prevalent in the 90's).  Why don't I get one?  Well, I lead a VERY low-risk life - exposure to the flu would be quite unlikely.  And I have an auto-immune disease, and these things make responses to vaccines a bit unpredictable.  Should my life circumstances change, and I were to become much more social and be around children or others that are likely to be carriers... of course I'd get a flu shot.I believe in dancing the fine line between being Prudent and being Paranoid. lol",

Hard stuff!!I was in Wash D.C. for the 1976 bicentennial also!  Graduated in 79.  I loved winter,  was always outside,   well I was outside all year round, so winter does not really count. I made to the Harvest Fest.  Stayed off my feet, except for caring for the dogs, until Friday night. Sold 3 paintings and some book marks.  Well done, considering the crowd was 1/2 of what was expected. Thing is you never know who will buy what,  size of crowd does not really matter. I was wrecked on Sunday,  physical limitations were pushed on a 14 hour day.  Slept most of the day Sunday. Speaking of burgers,  I think I will go to a place named the Pour House, best burgers around here.  I don't eat meat much,  but when I do, I go there. Peace all. Trina",

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.  It can be used as needed and can quit anytime without tapering.  The trick to it is \"low doses\".  (120 mg = 5mg elemental lithium)  Effective at just 5mg a day, wouldn't take more than 30mg)  :O)Post Edited (HJQuinn) : 9/28/2019 3:01:40 PM (GMT-6)",

I take one in the a.m. and one in the p.m.  It seems to actually be helping my digestion as well because of leveling out stress in my body.  It's really nice.  Sleeping much better too.  Oh be careful though because it raises Serotonin levels so if you are transitioning from an SSRI drug to this your Serotonin levels could get too high.  It may seem like a side effect but it is just the SSRI is still in your system.   Once it levels out, there should be no side effects.",

My doctor told me it woul be 4-6 weeks, but this could be different for different meeds and different people. The feeling you get initally (Where you feel great) could simply be expectation. You have something that you have been told will make you better and because you expect it to, it does but the feeling only lasts for a short period of time so potentially, this is what you are describing. As for treatment, I believe that meds are simply a coping mechanism for depression. For some people it allows them to cope to the point where they feel they are able to deal with the root cause by themselves (Hence, the drug can be seem as the 'cure') but for others, they need that little bit of extra help in the form of 'talking medicine' (I cant remember where I heard that phrase but I think its great!   \u00a0 If you are resistant to meds then I would definately look into talking medicine either in the form of self-help or professional counselling. \nI hope this helps\nDarren",

I seem to get this a lot when people, especially extended family, learn that I am 42 years old, no kids, and not married or dating.I really don't understand why many people think that being married/in a relationship is the end all be all for a person.

Sometimes, I wonder if I'm asexual. I mostly like being by myself although I do wish for companionship at times. I use to tell people that I want to be marry and have kids, but I now realize I was repeating what my family expected of me. I realize, through therapy, that it's okay to be single. I also think living in a big city, as opposed to a rural or small community, helps as there are a lot of people in the same boat.I just wish people didn't pity or think me abnormal for not being married or having kids.",

Sure I have moments, but I am starting to get my old independence back slowly.As for kids, I wanted them had miss carriages, was going to adopt, but both side of the family were so negative and racist about it,  I said no, why would I do that to a child. Now I am glad I didn't what a mess it would have been looking back.  No one should do any major life altering things, just because someone else wants them too.  Sara, I get how you feel.  I like my dogs better that a lot pf peoples company.Forever, I read an article on the same subject,  although it was more critical and going along the theory of selfishness and me me me.   But I don't agree, sure there are some I guess, but careers are a big cause to back off, and I know one woman who spent years with the Peace Corps,  met her husband Algerian/French man.The are marrying this Sun,  they may or may not have children,  she is 32. so I see multitude of reasons, as there are multitudes of people.  ON the Bright side,  I lost my phone in the ivy today, playing with the dogs.  No land line to call it. went next door and my neighbor gladly lent me her phone to call mine.  Had to put me hearing aids in, it is so windy here today. What a blessing she is so nice.   She is 25 yrs younger, so not close, but we chat every so often time for meds.

                "comment": "Same boat here -- very familiar to me. There seems to be a stigma associated with not being married or having kids, particularly when you get into middle age. By now, most of my peers have at least teenage or college-age kids, often bringing up their family lives in small talk. All those experiences are foreign to me, and all I can do is nod politely as they happily and proudly talk about their daughter's piano talent, son's vacation escapades, getting into some great college, etc.There's definitely been pressure from family, even if not in so many words. They seem to have stopped asking about my relationships/wife only recently, perhaps realizing it likely won't happen. I have no siblings with children, and the family line will die off with me. This may be the biggest part of the pressure, which may have gotten to me -- i.e., I was made to feel as though I'm letting them down, and in the worst way possible.Not really sure how to get past this -- some people emphasize how they couldn't imagine life without their SO, how their kids are their reason for living, etc. For those without, what else can substitute?Not that I was ever against marriage, kids, and the \"normal\" or \"expected\" life, but I simply never found anyone, or maybe something about me always ruined things. Many years ago, I was even on an \"incel\" forum, long before incel became a four-letter word. I never found solutions, even if I found others in the same situation. That forum is long gone, thanks to the \"new\" breed of violent, cynical incels out there. There doesn't even seem to be a replacement term for the \"old\" ones.",

I know I shouldn't diagnose myself or turn to 'Dr. Google' for answers, but my behavior seems to fit the  definition of OCD. I'm trying hard to correct my mindset, but it is such a struggle.",

I think just the fact that you KNOW your thoughts are irrational is huge. I just read something today that made sense to me. Whenever you're really ruminating or anxiety stricken try saying \"In all likelihood, it really could happen.\" It helps you to acknowledge that there is always a chance of something happening but doesn't mean it necessarily will.Do you take any medication? It might be worth talking to your doctor about. It doesn't have to be for forever and can help you work through this trying time in your life.",

You are much nicer than me as I would have told him to mind his business the minute he started his interrogation.I'm 42 and am constantly judge by my extended family for not being married and having no kids. It used to bother me alot, but now I don't give crap. The ironic thing is most of my relatives, judging me, had or  are in bad relationships. Some don't even have a good relationship with their kids.  It's incredibly rude to ask 'why don't you have kids' as some people are not able to or just don't want kids. Whatever the reason, it's no one's business.I suspect that your coworker is probably miserable with his own life as most judgmental people are. If they were so happy with their live, they wouldn't interrogate or be care so much about someone else's.Just ignore your coworkers and shut them down if they bother you.Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 10/4/2019 6:56:09 PM (GMT-6)",

As mentioned, it's none of his business what you do in your life.Some people are plain \"idiots\".  They like bullying people to make themselves feel better and bigger.  They especially like to bother the kind and quiet people.  Perhaps he is having home or other problems and taking his frustrations out on other people.  Maybe he's jealous of you for some reason.  I'm guessing, he was like this in school.There are millions of people who are unmarried without kids who are quite happy with their lives.  Others, who can't find their soulmate.  Even some who marry their soulmates get divorced.   I've read that a lot of the Millennials have no desire to get married after seeing so many other people getting divorced, including parents and aunts/uncles.  Some want to dedicate their lives to their jobs, some hoping they will build up their finances, so they can enjoy their retirement of traveling, etc.Maybe you should look for one or two of his weak spots.  Then when he bugs you again, you could throw that in his face.  Of course, that would be a last resort, especially if you think he is a better fighter. My Hubby mentioned that one because he was bullied in school and at work a few times, since he was only 126 lbs. during those times.  Then he took martial arts classes and built his muscles up since he figured something was going to come up again at some point.  Sure enough it did several times and he dealt with it both physically twice and verbally.  He made a fool out of the other guys.  My Hubby is a kind, smart but quiet Guy(he's not quiet with me   ).  No one better push his button or he'll figure out a way to put the abuser out.Of course, going to HR with your complaint would be the first choice since bullying is supposed to be 0 tolerance at school and work.  If a person is being harrassed then neither party is able to do their job properly.Do you get councelling or a therapist?  That is helpful too, if you get  a good one.You are definitely not alone  by a long shot.  Good Luck getting rid of the .........!!Post Edited (msOuchie) : 10/4/2019 7:21:32 PM (GMT-6)",

I never tried it before now.I hope you have a good evening and a good weekend.  Seems to me it always is Friday.  The weeks pass so fast anymore.Hugs, Karen...",

For me personally while I am on the \"high\" of ketamine it helps alot...I feel like I dont have a care in the world and there is no way I could ever be depressed and I have no pain. Then I \"come down\" and the effects last like 3 hours...sometimes more sometimes less... but after the effects are totally gone not only does the pain come back but so does the depression and in my experience it's worse when it does come back....almost like my mind is trying to make up for the time it lost. This is just my experience with it...does not mean it will be your experience...",

And then she doesn't.Well I tried that but I think my son needed me. I kept getting signs like I rented one car but we got a Jeep which he drove. Waiter- his name. other things. Plus dreams of him every night we were there and I have had a hard time remembering dreams.I can't tell you how sad and how worn out my soul feels.I don't like to be the complainer- I know how tiresome it is to listen to someone who is always down.I just don't know when my spirits will lift if ever.",

When my father died, it sent me into a deep depression right in the middle of a very stressful time in my schooling.  I didn't come out of that for a couple of years.  I think underlying depression can make things worse.  But I did come out of it.  I'm not over it, and I still cry about it sometimes, but I did stop thinking about his death and my loss all the time and remembered more of the good times and fun we had.  My father died 35 years ago this week.  I am trying to say, but not very well I'm afraid, that you WILL feel better, but I don't know when.  You will always miss your son.  It just gets to be less of a constant thing.  And when you do have times that you are not thinking about him, it doesn't mean that you are abandoning him or love him any less.",

She had started therapy but it was making her worse, so she stopped.  Before she left at the last session the therapist asked her to try one thing and to text him in 3 months to let him know how she was.  She agreed to this.The one thing was, to get a book, journal, anything, composition book,  and write to her children,  she could even have 2 separate books for each child.  She decided on 1 because they had a good relationship.  She said it was hard at first,  anger came out, grief was hard, crying as she wrote.  However, this was cathartic and she arrived at a place where she started to share here feelings with them.  Her love, memories, hopes and dreams that would not come to be.And late in the third month, she was writing to them everyday, letting them now, what the family and her were doing.When she talked to her therapist she agreed to see him once a month.  within 2 years she was writing only occasionally.  She realized that unconsciously she was letting go.  She then had therapy on an on call basis. I was memorized by this lady, we both have devastating histories,  but I think her joy and loss, then rebound slowly back into the presence is beyond what I could do.   She sad no,  it was not any different than what my journaling does for me.So weary,  I urge you to try this.  Or ask your doctor about this.  I can't remember, if you are in therapy if you are ask about it.   I wish you peace, comfort, compassion and strengthTrina",

Some people can't be reasoned with.So if a person with mental illness is given good and positive advice by a therapist, and he or she is too depressed to believe it, does that mean the advice didn't help the individual?Not necessarily. Sometimes a person isn't helped at first because he/she doesn't believe the advice.  However, over time, the person may come to believe it.  It may take weeks, months, or even years. But over time, the therapist can make a difference in the life of the person with helpful advice.It's often a slow process.  However, over time, the good advice can get through to those battling mental illness.  It just takes time.",

Before I had crps I was a well rounded competent individual with the memory of an elephant...I have had ptsd for awhile but now I have sever depression to the point I actually tried to kill myself by slitting my wrist and taking over 15 30mg percocet... my body threw up the percocet on it's own and now i have 10 stitches in my wrist. I have never tried to commit suicide before crps. I now have split personality disorder, depression, bipolar polar, generalized anxiety disorder, paranoia,  my short term memory is totally gone and I struggle every day on whether to keep living... with my therapist she actually listens to what I say and most of the time I come up with my own answers and she helps try to find a reason to keep living. Everyone is different and every therapist is different. You can see 100 different therapists and they will each have their own way of handling your particular situation.  Now as other people have said there a some people in this world that cant get help because when they are getting help they still dont feel as if they are so they refuse the help. Now when I first started going to therapy I was a person who went only because my family begged me to get help. I didnt believe in therapy and figured there was noone out there that can relate to me so when I first started going I turned deaf ears on my therapist and we actually sat there for 5 sessions and barely said anything because I refused to talk... she said something's to me then that while in the moment i could have cared less but over time i started thinking about what she was telling me and now we are talking to each other and i actually listen to what she says...sometimes i still dont get everything she says but it doesnt mean it doesnt help. So i guess to answer the actual question... even if it doesnt seem to help immediately it doesnt mean that it doesnt help in the end..now if a person is going to commit suicide they will find a way and do it no matter what but that one sentance may...just may be what saves that person's life down the road. So remember...you dont know what the next person is dealing with...be kind to others as you never know...that act of kindness may just be the reason that person doesnt kill him/herself or someone else. We all struggle with stuff but you never know what can help someone else.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 10/16/2019 4:19:39 AM (GMT-6)",

Today I did the real thing, using headphones with alternating beeps instead of eye movement.  We are working through the issue of shame, which is pervasive in my life.  We went back all the way to an incident n school when I was 7.  Interestingly enough, it makes me feel kind of ashamed to do this because I don't have what I would consider PTSD.  I have been very fortunate in my life not to have suffered any trauma and sometimes this makes me feel like I am just faking being depressed.  Anyway, I kinda went off topic.

It started with not sleeping through the night which is unusual for me and then the frequent crying came back. A few days ago I was listening to a podcast that unexpectedly got into a lot of existential stuff related to meditating that previously wouldn\u2019t have bothered me and I may have found it interesting but since about a year ago I can\u2019t listen to it. I had to shut it off half way through because it made me feel totally detached, feeling of dread and not like myself and I feel like I\u2019ve gone totally backwards. I\u2019m trying to pull out any tools I can think of to ground myself, doing lots of art and keeping as busy as possible but it does get me freightened that this is happening and is making it hard to enjoy things because I feel somewhat separated from it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!",

I mean sort of in the sense that something within the process has instigated a mind response and thus it's safety mechanism has been tripped.Fear not....breathe through it. I am safe or a mantra of the same effect. This type of situations are common, and it doesn't always pertsin to unresolved issues....the ill informed always believe so.We we get into a funk via something that you are experiencing or for no reason our mind is more susceptible to emotive and sensitivities and triggers than when we are more stable.Your tool box...good on ya. The reason this is happening can be something your mind may see as a trigger...it could be just benign it may have relevance but if it does not then correct your mind. Mantra.Keep \ud83d\udcaa....our minds play havoc with us and sometimes we got to correct it. It will pass. Your sharing shows your strength and therefore with support will combat it.HT",

The last time around I thought I was actually losing it. But now I know it's how my mind responds to stress or a trigger. I have an app called Smiling Mind that I use at night sometimes to help me get to sleep. There are many different guided meditations, but I typically always use the sleep one.I wish you well!",

It's sad, but mental illness is still somewhat a taboo in my family. I once tried to confide in my mother, but she got really upset, and I never brought it up again. I wonder if depression is a taboo issue in other people's families as well.

Those who never suffered clinical depression often seem to think that you can just \"snap out of it\" or find the willpower to defeat it. Even those who are wiser and more empathetic -- who try hard to put themselves in your shoes -- wind up with only \"academic\" knowledge of the condition.Unfortunately, true understanding seems to require direct personal experience. If someone never felt a red hot poker applied to the skin, they may be told that it's agonizing and unbearable, but they can never feel it until it happens to them.In America, at least, there are more widespread efforts to create awareness. I think the situation is far worse elsewhere in the world, particularly in countries where men and women have \"traditional\" roles. Men in particular tend to be expected to be strong and easily capable of dealing with their \"feelings.\" Seeking help for depression might even ostracize people in such cases.",

I am the first that I know of that has gotten help.  Both siblings tout me as a drug addict,  when in truth they are or were.  When I disclosed the abuse to my sister, one of main abusers, within 10days all blood relatives had shunned me, down to 2nd cousins.   1st cousins were abused by their fathers, my uncles also.  But deny it. Even though abuse and mental illness is spoken about more in society today.  And children are more protected. I think there will always be a stygma on mental illness.  Which I don't understand, because addiction seems more like a choice and logically that would be more shameful to the family.    But that is just my perception.I have learned I can only tell the truth, my truth.  If no one believes me,  I can do nothing about it.  If a person decides to support me great. For instance,  2 weeks ago a male friend and I went to a used book store,  while we were there I dissociated and said something about sex that I do not remember.   He called me on it the next day.  After a conversation and sending him a paragraph in one of my books, he backed down.   Have not heard from his since.  We have been friends for 2 years.

My personal life and career is down the toilets, and I'm feeling utterly worthless at this point.I don't even get up now until around noon and am finding it hard to even do simple task like combing my hair, etc.To top it off, I'm binge eating like there is no tomorrow. I was watching a video about weight loss, and the host said something interesting. She said 'when you love yourself, weight loss will be easy because you will care about what you are putting into your body'; this really had me thinking about my binge-eating.  I think my binge-eating is symptomatic about how I feel about myself--overeating for me in a way is like 'killing oneself'. Besides my binge-eating, I find myself turning to the occult. I tend to watch videos on the paranormal when I'm extremely down. I don't know why I'm fascinating by the paranormal when I'm really depressed.

Though it may be interesting to you at this time, it's bad juju.  The binge-eating really needs to stop.  If you start gaining weight that will make you depressed too.  Learn to be mindful about what you are eating.  But know we probably have all done it at one time or another.  I find when I have a lot of time on my hands I want to eat.  Do you have any hobbies?  Or could you donate some of your time at a shelter or with the elderly?  I really feel you need to find something to do in place of working.  And don't give up on the work.  Prepare for it even if you don't have anything going on.It takes a lot of courage to post when we are having a hard time.  This is a big step.

I have an appointment with my therapist this week, so I'll discuss how I feel. I'm anxious though about therapy because the fee has gone up from $35 to $50. I am self-pay as I don't have any insurance, so the fee is very expensive to me.When my therapist last spoke to me, she said she may give me some alternative options. I don't know if that means going to a different center with lower fees, etc. One thing I know is that I really need my medication; it has helped me a lot with anxiety and depression.

She said she knows not every day I will be able to come up with 3 but I can't seem to even come up with 1. Anyone else been asked to do something like this? What kind of things did you write down?",

I like nature and have a lot of it around me so that makes it kind of easy for me.  Keep searching.  The better you feel the easier it will be to think of things.  But it also helps when you look for positive things.  I really think and believe that when you look at things in a positive light that it comes back to you.  Like a chain reaction.  It sounds like you have a good therapist.  And be honest, if you don't see positives, let her know.  She will know how much help you need this way.

One way that I have found that helps me to develop positive thinking is developing gratefulness.  Because the more grateful we are, the more good we can see, which in turn makes us even more grateful.Gratitude has a twofold effect. A person who offers thanks is likely inclined to feel good about himself, and the one who receives the thanks feels better too.\u201cRobert Emmons, codirector of a University of California study project on gratitude, made this point: \u201cSeeing with grateful eyes requires that we see the web of interconnection in which we alternate between being givers and receivers.\u201d The fact is that our lives are sustained and supported by others in many ways. For example, they may provide our food or give us medical attention.\u201d Perhaps we could think about simple things like our meals that we eat, then think of the manys way we can be grateful.1-Did you really enjoy a meal today?2-What did you like about it?3- Are you grateful for the person who prepared it? Even if it's you, you can be happy that you accomplished it.4-Even the farmers and producers; we may not know them but are we grateful for their hard work?Keep going! You're a step in the right direction.",

That way I can only focus on what I am doing.  I have the capability of doing the dishes, though a dishwasher would be nice, oh, I am the dishwasher...  LOL...JRF007, there is so much in life to be grateful for and happy about.  It is just they are little things that a lot of people don't even notice.  Can you get by nature?

Some shrinks will tell their patients who are struggling to cope with what happened to them to \"Let it go.\"Of course, you can't just snap your fingers and move on if you've had one or more bad things happen to you in your past.So why do some psychiatrists and therapists tell many of their clients to \"Let it go?\"The reason is that when a shrink tells a patient to let it go, it does something psychologically in a good way to some of their patients.  It can actually help them to let it go, or at least to a point, even though shrinks know that you can't just suddenly and magically let it go.  It's the same principle as a therapist telling someone who obsesses about something to \"Stop it!\"A counselor telling their clients to \"Let it go\" doesn't work for everyone.

We've known each other for most of our lives. She has this habit of kind of - hanging on to the past, and assuming these memories are crystal clear and objective, even when nobody else remembers them the same way, or at all. In them, every fault, every mistake (real or perceived) everything is amplified 300%.  Once, she was talking about a distant event where she felt she was 'so useless' and when I told her I felt she was on fire that evening, it kind of left her stunned, because it was completely at odds with the fiction she'd built for herself.Many of her other friends see it the same way, too. I don't think being told to let it go would help her; she has a very analytic mindset. Whether chemical or psychological, I think some people simply can't let it go as easily as others - for example, with my gallows humor, I'm pretty good at staying cheerful and feeling non-stressed even though life has been full of stressors. But, I think for another set of people, someone - especially in a position of authority - saying that it's okay to let it go, that they CAN let it go, must be incredibly helpful and liberating, a kind of first step towards recovery. Maybe even more.As another view, for people who can't let it go easily, maybe it'd be helpful to look at it as - why can't I let go, and is there a way to turn that into a strength; can I focus on what made me happy, or proud, or did good for my friends?Seriously good topic Mike, I hope this is an okay contribution.Peace!",

Your post actually made me think about my mindset and personality. Like your friend, I repeatedly analyze or ruminate about things in the past. I strive for perfection in all that I do and like order and predictability. I don't know if I would be classified as having an analytical, uptight, or rigid mindset, but I do know that it is very hard for me to let  go of  hurtful incidents which happened years ago; I partly think my mindset or personality is too blame. When I look at my friends, who aren't uptight like me, they seem to let go of things more easily.  For some people, it is easy to let go. Of course, it also depends on what you're 'letting go'. If someone suffered an intense trauma, such as abuse of any nature, I would imagine it might be harder for that person to let it go and move forward with their lives. As MMB, however, said the principle of 'let it go' has helped some trauma victims/survivors, so I guess mindset does play a role, as well as other factors.",

Karen mentioned thinking things over more seriously when depression was at it's worst; I figure that sometimes depression/trauma can make us view parts of ourselves in a more unpleasant, critical light. Trying to do your best and to create a more rational world is a good goal. Just because that urge sometimes fights whatever you might need to deal with the past doesn't mean that it, or you, are flawed, or to blame, or that there's any part of who you are to blame.Sometimes, our worldviews try to solve every issue the same way though, which - doesn't always work out. As an example, I have (in general) a laid-back attitude; and while it makes me handle stressors pretty well, I've been really thinking, am I handling individual days well..?Anyway, all of it's food for thought - thank you for sharing yours.

If what I have to say helps just one person it's worth it to me.I had been in Therapy for many years and my Therapist would keep telling me to \"let it go.\"  How do I let go and forgive? Forgive!? Let go? Seriously!  Easy to say but so very difficult to do and again, how?Ask yourself; if I keep repeating the hurt, anger, pain, from the past how does that serve me? Will keeping it with me change what happened? No, it doesn't. So what purpose does it serve? Nothing, but keeps you in the state of mind you are in.  But, it's important to keep asking yourself the question each time something comes up ~ what purpose does this serve? Then seriously think about how it servers you better self.It can take time, trial and error to find what will work for you to let go and forgive. It's not easy to let go and forgive.  I did let go and I did forgive and if you are able to do it, it can be a very freeing experience.  Change your thought process (a Therapist can help with this). Be open to all possible options for change, even those that you disregarded in the past.  open yourself to spirituality (this is not a one size fits all and not necessarily \"traditional\").  There is so much to explore that could possibly be your answer to letting go.  I found \"letting go\" and forgiveness in quite a sudden and unexpected way. But, I still have more work to do.

I\u2019ve had electric shock therapy and tried every medication and treatment out there. I have an excellent psychiatrist and therapist I see weekly. Just managing this alone is hard. Especially when I have a 6 year old. I broke my hip 2 years ago and had a total replacement. Found out I have osteoporosis. It dislocated 4 months ago. So I have that chronic pain to deal with. I also have lifelong Orthopedic problems in my feet resulting in a number of surgeries. I need another one. I saw the orthopedic Dr about the pain in my feet lately. Did an mri and discovered I have sever Synovitis which eventually led to my RA diagnosis. Started DMARDS about 6 weeks ago. No relief yet. Flare ups have intensified. I\u2019m going to the dr today to talk about prednisone. I\u2019m worried about that affecting my depression and anxiety and weight. I\u2019m 230 and 5\u20196. I went to a bariatric surgeon last week with high hopes but she said she wanted me to be mentally stable for a year even though my psychiatrist said it was ok. My depression meds make me hungry. These are the best luck we\u2019ve had and I\u2019m not going to change them. I\u2019m doing physical therapy 3 times a week and doing the exercises at home. I just feel so lost and discouraged. The weight contributes to my illness and depression. I can\u2019t get the weight off because of my mental health. It\u2019s a horrible circle. The most important thing to me is to be a good mom. I feel like I\u2019m totally failing. I\u2019m either crying or in bed with the heating pad. When I do play with her I\u2019m so anxious I\u2019m not in the moment and cant stop worrying. We started kindergarten this year and I\u2019m trying to keep up with public school and all the activities and her extracurricular activities. Trying to run the house and keep it clean and just keep up with everything. I did not need this diagnosis. I have an excellent support system and am doing what I can with relaxation and meditation but I\u2019m just so jittery. I can\u2019t make my brain stop. These flare ups are awful. I have old codeine and that helps but I only have so much. I feel like I\u2019m drowning. I\u2019m so scared about RA. I used to be a dynamic social worker in a super high stress job before this last horrible depression hospitalized me 5 years ago. I feel no sense of worth. No self esteem especially because I\u2019m so much bigger than the other moms. I\u2019m doing everything. Therapy, exercise, meds but I\u2019m just failing. I feel like a failure in every way. Please help me.I gave you some paragraphs for easier reading...Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 9/26/2019 11:09:56 AM (GMT-6)",

I have fibromyalgia and I know what it is like to be in pain and depressed.  Not being able to do the things you would like and need to do.  I am glad you said you had a good support system.  Have you ever practiced mindfulness?  I believe the site is \"mindful.org\".  They can guide you.  Basically it is just focusing on the moment.  Forget the past and the future, just live in the moment.  Some people say the \"now\".  It helps and goes well with the meditation as that makes you focus on the moment also.Try to self nurture too.  .Do some nice things for yourself.  Get that self esteem back.  It can be done.  And most importantly, you are NOT a failure.  You are a kind, caring person who may have ran into some bumps in the road, but is not failing or unworthy.  Hang in there, things are going to get better.  Take it one day at a time.Hugs, Karen...",

I\u2019ve just been so frantic and busy dealing with all this I haven\u2019t made time. If I\u2019m not at an appointment I\u2019m trying to keep up with my daughters school which is really hard. There\u2019s so much going on and they post things all the time. And when I\u2019mNot doing that my brain is on speed doing and thinking about all the things that need to get done before she gets home. But then when she does my mental state is so bad by then I\u2019m crying and anxious and not able to be with her. Or in a bad place and faking it until she goes to bed. I\u2019ve got to make time to start it again. It has to be on my list of things to do. It\u2019s so hard meditating and being mindful. I usually start crying if I\u2019m still. But I know it takes practice and something I must teach myself. I will try harder. Thank you",

I went to bed healthy and strong one night and woke up hit by a Mack truck.It got so bad I became unable to even sit up unassisted. But the good news is that's all behind me and I am fully functional with minor flares that do not debilitate me.DMARDS take time to work. I went on Methotrexate almost immediately along with prednisone and I still suffered for a good stretch. I changed rheumatologists and the new one put me on 40 mgs of prednisone a day to trigger my immune system to stop attacking me. It worked. It took me 1 1/2 years to wean off of it and I was sick for about that long. However like I said- it quieted and now I just take plaquenil. I remember being very depressed when I was that ill. Not the type of person who wants people doing for me. Was very frustrated that I couldn't do for myself.There are also biologics you can try. I was on Humira for a little while.I'm wishing you good response to your meds and hope your RA quiets like mine did.You read a lot negative things about RA but they have come a long way in treating it.All my best",

I was started on Latuda about two weeks ago and felt no difference.  I went to my therapist yesterday and was such a mess that they put me into the psychiatrist right away.  They mentioned a short term facility and I refused because of all my responsibilities I have at home and no one to help me.  So he increased my Latuda from 20mg to 40mg and said it will take a few weeks to work.  Does anyone have any advise on what to do in the mean time?  I don't see my therapist for two week and hope I will settle down until then.  Has anyone taken Latuda for major depression and does it work?  I know I am rambling on, but this is a feeling I have never had before and it scares me.  I just want to feel better and I'm not sure how long it will take.",

                "comment": "Hi Maggie,I am sorry for what you are going through right now.  Know we all have been there or are going through it too.  Just try to hang in there, some antidepressants can take up to 8 weeks to reach full potential.  Though you could start feeling better sooner.  I understand why you don't want to go inpatient.  When you have a lot of responsibility at home it is nearly impossible to go.  Though if it comes down to your health, you may need to make arrangements.  I respect your decision to not go.  I find meditation helps me.  And mindfulness.  Living in the moment.  These are things that need to be practiced, but know practicing is doing.  The meditation really helps me at night to fall asleep.  My mind doesn't like to shut off.  The meditation helps with that.Are you bi-polar?  Just curious because Latuda is often used for bi-polar.  I take a bi-polar medication called abilify.  I use it as a mood stabilizer.  It helps a lot.  Check out our resource thread at the top of the main depression page.  You will find links to helpful resources.  There is a lot we can do to help ourselves in times like what you are going through.  The waiting game...  No fun...  I hope you feel better soon.  I just added Lexapro (I take four things for depression) to the mix of medications I take.  It actually worked fast and I am feeling  a lot better.  I hope that the increase in Latuda will help you soon.  Try to be optimistic.  Best wishes...Hugs, Karen...",

I am reading as much as I can but any advice is very, very appreciated. I don't care how far down the slope I slide as long as I can help them.This year has by far been the hardest of my life and I suffered from deep depression in the past. I am so thankful that I have my mental health in a good place but I'm starting to fall apart. I won't make an egregiously long post with all the details but essentially every single person in my family(mom, sister, dad, 2 grandmas, brother, husband) have really needed me there for support for them this year. Be it mental health, medical issues, losing a loved one, general drama, etc. I also have a 7 year old who was just hospitalized with a bad illness AND a 9 month old. From the day he was born everyone has needed me so much. I thought this was going to be my year where I got to work on my degree, enjoy my baby and get back into shape but there's been a BIG blow up of some sort almost every month. I obviously love the people I'm helping and WANT to help. In fact I HAVE to help. It's in my nature. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't bc I can't stand to see my loved ones hurting. They truly have needed me and have had big problems themselves but I have no one to rely on. I know you have to take care of yourself in order to help others but I don't have anyone to go to or anywhere to turn. If anyone has advice for self care or whatever its greatly appreciated. I have a suicidal loved one currently( as stated in the beginning) and it's scaring me so badly. I'm trying to help but so afraid I'm going to fail. I'm using all reading material I have to help them as it's top priority and urgent but I know I can't operate at my best to help them if I can't find ways for myself to remain okay as well.I feel so selfish even posting this and hope it doesn't come across as super selfish. Essentially I want to help myself stay mentally well so I can continue to help my loved ones.",

She was potty house trained long ago.    I moved the crate into the garage just in case, it has not been a week yet.  But I was gone 4 hours and 3 hours, so I am 99% positive we are done with the crate.  Will take apart and put in attic soon. This Thursday is my 2nd trial for the nerve block in my neck. If it goes as well as the first, no reason why it should not,  procedure will be scheduled 2 weeks after. Depending on docs scheduleI use to have favorite seasons,  guess spring still is.. promise of growth, rebirth all that kind of stuff. past two years with my pain, I have not enjoyed to much though.  temps changes daily for then 15 degrees and my pain goes up to 8-10.  Today and beautiful,  refused to stay inside,  pain is a 10, Tylenol 45yr girl next door, chain came off her bike, so I put it back on for her, than she decides to ride her scooter[?]Gotta love it!  Cute a Button!  She didn't want the chain to come back off.dog have been out all day, they will crash tonight which is a good thing.  Especially for the young one.T4 not really working so I think a nap with a hot pack on my eyes is in order. Mainer,  I always wanted to come up and see the sites.  Husband always found a reason not to, although we did travel a lot before I became disabled.  We have been separated almost 2 yrs now.   Doesn't he take his girlfriend up to Maine 3 weeks ago.  What can you do.  You live in a beautiful state!!HT. hope you are get warmer.  watched a Shark special the other night and they were in your neck of the woods explaining how sharks will disappear when killer whales show up. interesting. Everyone a great day!PeaceTrina",

Will be treating with a chiropractor locally and seeing my g.p. about other treatment options.We're in 'false fall' right now.  Summer could return at any moment!  Part of me is enjoying the cooler temps and mostly the lower humidity.  Mosquitoes are still ferocious though.  The garden is winding down but still has a show to put on.  The Autumn Joy sedums are just starting to bloom, the crepe myrtle is in it's glory, the deep purple morning glories and lavender/pink bindweed are blooming prolifically.  The Montauk daisies are huge this year and should put on quite a show.  The tassles from the ornamental grasses are just starting to peep out.  Only one dahlia blossom so far but I'm hoping for more.  The canna and hibiscus continue to bring me the colors of summer, so I've bunched the pots together to enjoy for as long as I can.  The coleus and rex begonia have been giving me quite a nice foliage display, too!I'm not exactly looking forward to the cold winter months but the amaryllis have had a wonderful summer vacation outside and I hope to have several blooms this year inside my kitchen!  I've been working on a crocheting project...either a shawl or lap robe...depending on how much I care to add to it.  I've put up a little display on top of the china cabinet of summer related decor and will switch it out each month with a new theme.  Nearly time to stock up on suet cakes for the birds that don't fly south, too!I've found that finding things to keep me going through winter sure beats just dreading it!  I picked up a new pattern booklet for crochet...maybe I'll teach myself some new stitches this year.  I've also considered trying my hand at jewelry making or getting some paint by numbers (my Mom used to do these).  My old pursuits of baking through the winter aren't physically possible much anymore.  If not for my grandson being willing to do the stirring, we wouldn't even have brownies! lolI don't want to keep myself from enjoying what today may bring by thinking too much about things I can't control in the future.",

I have had my current job for almost a year, but I still get nervous if we don't seem busy enough.  But I am glad to see you posting. OK day today at work, still liking all my co workers.  I have taken to stopping at thrift stores after work.  I get a little dopamine buzz, I guess, so it is like getting a drink after work without all of the problems associated with that.

Have work around the house,  hole in ceiling to fix in living room and dining room from valances taken down.  Shelves to put up,  vents to take off and clean.

I hope everyone out there gets through the weekend OK.Speaking of the weekend, on the Friday before a 3 day weekend, everyone in the Denver metro area gets in their car and heads for the mountains.  This makes it very difficult for me to get home.  I don't usually work on Fridays anymore, but I was covering for someone today.  I left the office at 5:00, had a nice dinner in town, went to a thrift store and spent an hour there and then started home at 8 pm.  I knew the interstate would  be a mess but I figured the secondary \"canyon\" route would be clear by then, but no.  So I took my alternative alternate route, a winding tertiary route that takes me out of my way but at least I am moving the whole time.  It should have only taken me 45 minutes to get home from the thrift store, but this time it took almost 2 hours.",

Very pleasant.  It was nice to sit on the patio with no mosquitoes and no pets trying to get up on my lap!Sunny start to today but rain coming later.  Did some clean up in the garden and more to do, so that will keep me occupied until the rain comes.No 'holiday plans'.  Daughter will be working today as usual.  We took both dogs for a walk yesterday, only part of the old route as my back and her knees are not great.  Dogs love it, of course!  Last night, though, Micah was limping, not wanting to put weight on the back leg again.  Going to have a sedentary day, I think.  Gave her glucosamine last night and will again this morning.  I've the feeling it's going to be a tough winter for her.  She did not want to come up the back steps after her morning potty time.  On the 'bright side'...her vet told me she would take the same pain medicine I'm on so I'll already have some on hand until I can get her there for her own prescription (already discussed with vet).Now that 'summer' is over, I hope to get some visits in with my granddaughter, who is usually kept very busy with the other side of the family all season long.  At least the other grandma shares pictures on facebook!  My son hopes to have a new job this week, which will mean he can get back on his regular visitation schedule and make more money to boot!  Fingers crossed!  He passed the aptitude test and has his second interview this week!",

Apparently, potential employers can learn so much about a person just through handwriting, among other things.

He also stated that a person should never put when they graduated from school because potential employers try to guess a person age based on that date.It's so interesting as I have done many of the things that I shouldn't have.

The butterfly bushes still have blossoms, too.  The sedums are blooming like crazy.  I've potted some yellow mums in the purple hanging pots and put them up on the shepard's hook out front.  The berries on the Virginia Creeper vine, Bittersweet vine and False Grape vines are showing nicely with their deep purple/black, yellow/orange and blues and turquoise.  A few hibiscus blooms have returned as well.  The buds on the Montauk Daisies hold promise for still more to come!I put the 'fall' slipcovers on the Adirondak chair cushions and swapped the aqua table for a purple one in between.  I've brought in the Amaryllis plants as it's time to stop watering them so they can go dormant.  Next, I'll be moving the umbrella out of the way so I can move the chiminea closer to the chairs and enjoy some roasted marshmallows on a cool evening.  The cigar plant (cuphea ignea) is blooming again and I caught sight of the hummingbird feeding from it at sunrise this morning.Have been visiting the Goodwill for inexpensive fall decor.  Picked up a huge serving platter in the shape of a leaf for under 5 bucks...looked it up online and saw similar ones going for 50 bucks!

I may be in a similar situation with being \"overqualified\" (which tends to be a euphemism for \"too old\").

I was actually advised to leave out dates as to when I graduated from school as potential employers try to guess your age based on that.  The person who suggested that I 'dumb down' my resume indicated that some potential employers may think that you won't stay in the position you're applying to if you have substantial experience in a different field. In other words, the job you're applying to is a 'stop gap' until you get a better job in your previous field.My trouble with revamping my resume is that I don't have much experience in the the jobs I'm applying for although I have a lot of transferable skills.",

I had told him he'd have to wait for a bail reduction hearing.  Meanwhile, his sister and step mother went behind my back and arranged for bail.  No one read the fine print at the bottom of the page.  After he was incarcerated, no one kept up on the payments.My daughter had given my phone number on the paperwork, so the collections agency started calling my home about the debt.  I was livid.  Eventually it all went to court and both my daughter and my son agreed the debt was theirs to pay and arrangements were made.Well, those payments got defaulted on and.....yep.....I start getting the phone calls again!  Then, my daughter is sent more court papers saying they are going to collect all of the interest, too!  I talk with the lawyer and ask if a lump sum payment is made, can this all go away?  Terms are worked out and my partner agrees to make the lump sum payment and my children can then pay her back.My daughter has been making the payments...my son has not.  Last night, she starts complaining to me...that I should talk to him and tell him he has to make payments, too.  I came close to exploding on her.None of this is MY mess!  The weapons were my ex-husbands.  I did not arrange for the bail.  I had no papers to read the fine print from.  Yet, I was the one harassed over and over about the payments!  My daughter and grandson live with me...rent free (not what I had in mind) and she has the audacity to complain to me about him not paying!?  My partner paid so that she wouldn't get socked for all of the interest and this is the thanks?So, I called my son.  Told him he needs to respond to her texts.  Told him that I agree he should be helping to pay the money back to my partner.  Then, I told them both this is the last I want to hear anything about the bail, EVER!My ex husband is dead...never should have had any weapons to begin with...step mother should have had them removed from the home after his death...has never paid one dime on this bill or gotten one phone call about it...has gotten off scot free!I'm angry.  I'm tired.  Stick a fork in me...I'm DONE!  I'm so tired of being 'the bad guy' (she uses a different term).  Thank you all for 'listening'...if I didn't have a safe place to unload this...well, we know what thoughts follow, don't we?",

Try to hang in there. If it get worse, contact your doctor.Yesterday, I felt exactly how you feel now. I was lethargic and tired despite the fact that I slept for 8 hours. I was literally on the couch, in my nightgown, for most of the day. Oh...and I forgot to add that I was binge eating like there was no tomorrow. However, I forced myself to go for a walk and exercised today. I felt a little bit better afterwards (although I had another binge eating episode). I think that you should go for a long walk or do something that keeps you active. Do you have a hobby? If you do, maybe you could concentrate on it.No matter what, try to force yourself to do an activity, (i.e. housecleaning, walking, dancing, etc.) even if it's just a few minutes. You might feel better afterwards.",

                "comment": "Hi folks. Thank you all for your messages - I can't believe how time flies when you're not having fun :-/ Nothing very much has happened. I had my second cataract operation done about 3 weeks ago. It seemed to go okay, but when I saw the opthalmologist last week, he explained that I had something called Posterior Capsule Opacification. This is a pretty common complication of cataract surgery, but most people get it months or years later. I was not expecting to have it already, but apparently it appears quicker in people with uveitis. Anyway, it's easily cured with a laser treatment. The good news is it might sharpen up my blurry vision; the bad news is I have to wait 3 months. Because of this I've decided to hold off on travelling. My vision isn't so bad I can't see, but the left eye ended up being blurrier than the right one and the overall effect is quite irritating. I was actually going to get some new glasses, but the opthalmologist advised me to wait. In the meantime I've got a cheap pair of bogstandard reading glasses. I can actually read better than I did before, but anything further than a foot and a bit away is useless. I was thinking of getting a pair of intermediate distance glasses as well, but I will wait until I've had this laser treatment done (luckily both eyes can be treated at once.)I'm still thinking about getting a dog >_>. I am still off the quetiapine (Seroquel). Ironically enough, stopping it didn't solve the issue I had stopped it for in the first place (blurry vision), but I decided not to resume it anyway. Different reasons really, but the main one was that the grogginess was getting worse over time. I hadn't increased the dose in a year, yet I went from being relatively functional to being barely able to function during the daytime - by the late evening I would wake up and feel lively, then not get to sleep until 4 or 5am. When I stopped the quetiapine, I didn't get a wink of sleep for 3 days. Then over the next 4 weeks, I would get a couple of hours here and there at most. That I manage to fall asleep fairly easily now I credit to melatonin. Started taking 300mcg 4 hours before bedtime. And as long as I remain consistent with taking it at the same time every night, it works. So..... what's the problem? I'm sleeping okay, I can even make morning appointments now! I don't really know. Seroquel is a strong drug and even at my relatively low dose, it still made me feel like I was wrapped in a chemical security blanket at times. I kind of miss that comforting numbness. Now I'm numb but in an even.... number way, which I wasn't expecting when I stopped it. When I'm not utterly unable to feel anything at all, I feel only one of two things: rage or dread. The other night I tried to feel sadness, which I know is there, and it was almost impossible - I had to go through an exhausting and grim rage first, silently, because it was night time and my neighbours were probably asleep above me. As for happiness, lol, what is that? <_<I am hoping that this is still a readjustment to the quetiapine. I stopped it 6-7 weeks ago and all the physical side-effects (the extreme itching, temperature regulation issues, insomnia, etc.) have gone now. But I do know it can take a long time for the brain to return to homeostasis - neurotransmitters to return to normal levels, receptors to recover, etc. With opiates especially, there is a post-acute withdrawal syndrome which can last for months. But it can occur with other types of drugs too. I've been on a lot of other psychiatric meds too, and I do wonder how they've messed with my brain. The trouble is, nothing really works for me and I can't cope with life, people, the universe, everything. Even spiders are a source of fear for me, especially in the late summer (that's right now, guys). Let me tell the story of spiderbro. A few weeks ago I was coming home late one night from my parents' house. Before I entered the block of flats, I looked at the doorway for a few seconds, subconsciously scanning for spiders. I saw nothing. Reached for the door when a massive house spider scuttled past it at great speed, just missing my hand. Dear god, where did it come from? I probably broke a world record that night for backwards long-jumping. I just had time to see the spider go into the corner between the door and the wall. Now that wall happened to be the wall of my flat - my bedroom specifically. Once I had summoned up the courage to enter my flat, I sprayed spider repellent around all the doors and window frames and if I could have erected \"No Spider\" signs, I would have done that too. Well, to cut this exciting story short, spiderbro lived up there in that corner for 3 weeks. He would swivel around from time to time, and occasionally he even moved an actual centimetre or so! His life was nearly as pointless as mine, bless him. Anyway, a few days ago spiderbro packed his bags and left for new and undiscovered corners. To my surprise, I was a little bit sad to see him gone  I had got used to him, although I'm still terrified of seeing a massive house spider inside my flat. I can't rationalise my way out of this phobia either: god only knows I've tried. Maybe the next step is to try a spider as a pet.... >.>*sees time* Okay, well I've rambled enough :p It's pretty much my bedtime now anyway (that entire post took a lot longer to write than I thought it would). Goodnight folks; take care everyone and I hope you are all keeping well - or, at least, as well as is possible.",

There's an overgrown lavender bush in my mum's garden and it's right next to the table and chairs. The bees are sometimes only a few centimetres away from your face but, unlike wasps, they never ever bother you. @Karen - If I could get close enough to a large house spider to step on it, I wouldn't need to kill it! If it wasn't for the arachnophobia, I'd be perfectly happy to co-exist peacefully with my 8-legged spiderbros. Particularly as I live in a country where a) none of them are poisonous and b) none of them are the size of a dinnerplate. It's just my dumb brain being dumb and not realising that, in evolutionary terms, humans have moved on from these ancient threats. Unless you live in Australia; hi hairytarantulabro! I got a date for my laser treatment - 15th November. I'm glad about that, but very worried as well. If we crash out of the EU on the 31st October, it will be bad. I will put it here, my secret fear, and then maybe I can come back at a later date and laugh at how stupid I was. Or ask you guys to send food parcels. I'm only half joking, that's the thing: I really am scared about food shortages and the resulting chaos, rioting and martial law. I am not saying these things will definitely happen - I am saying it's one possibility out of several. That's the worst case scenario that has been hinted at, but not actually given to the British public yet. The scenarios that have been leaked so far are pretty terrifying already, tbh. Believe it or not, there is potentially an even bigger problem than Brexit and that's the right wing coup which is behind Brexit. That's another story and as much as I would love to talk about #StopTheCoup, it probably is too overtly political for this forum.Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest. I did feel very slightly better today - not 'normal', but not an utterly numb zombie either. I'm trying to maintain hope, which is not easy for a lifelong pessimist like me.",

Reminds me of my childhood home where house spiders abounded: they particularly seemed to like my bedroom, but the bathtub was another popular spot. None ever dropped down on me thankfully, but more than once I awoke to find a massive house spider nestled between the wall and ceiling a foot above my head - I was in a bunk bed. The giant house spider also used to hold the world record for top spider speed. From wikipedia: With speeds clocked at 1.73 ft/s (0.53 m/s; 1.18 mph; 1.90 km/h), the giant house spider held the Guinness Book of World Records for top spider speed until 1987 when it was displaced by solifugids, although the latter are not true spiders.The speed at with which spiderbro whipped past me a few weeks ago, I'm not surprised. Those bros are fast.@Buena - \"It's a little far and too hot.\" That's probably what I would say as well ;p Would be fascinating to see a tarantula migration though. From a distance. High up. With a pair of binoculars.@Karen - Good luck with your doctor's appointment today. Quiet day here. I was at my gardening place yesterday, which went quite well. The pond is so overgrown and dried up, it's difficult to even see the water. Personally I preferred it before it became so overgrown with bullrushes and things, but we've got moorhens now and they seem to like it here.Anyway, I'm gonna get a cup of tea, then pop out for a bit to get something for dinner. Had a thai curry last week which was pretty nice, if not fantastic for my stomach. But I'm not letting good ingredients go to waste, so I'm gonna make another thai curry.",

                "comment": "\"Remember we are massive gigantic beings to them and they more scared of us\" I absolutely promise you I am more scared of the spider >_>. More seriously, most spiders have very poor eyesight and probably can't even see us. Which seems odd with 8 eyes, but there you go - evolution obviously decided spiders needed lots of eyes for some reason. (The jumping spiders are an exception and have excellent eyesight: they can even see the moon. Plus they are oddly, weirdly cute ;_;)@Trina - I've heard of mint oil as a spider repellent (conkers are another one). We had an ant problem in our old house, and they were a bit of a nightmare. I'm not normally squeamish about ants but one night I went down to the kitchen to get a drink, and the floor was literally black with ants. I have never, ever seen so many ants in one place - it honestly made me feel slightly ill. Anyway, I just went back up to bed sans drink. Don't think I've seen an ant in my flat. As I'm not too bothered by the spindly daddy long legs spiders I leave those ones be. I wonder if I would see more insects if they weren't around. But that said, my parents aren't scared of spiders and never kill or chuck them out, and that didn't stop the March Of The Ants across our kitchen floor. @Karen - Good news about your blood sugar levels :p Going over to my parents' house in a bit. Been following politics closely this week and even watching parliament live (I know, I know - I officially have no life). It was tremendously satisfying seeing Johnson have to pretend he didn't want an election, and then almost begging the opposition to give him an election the very next day - he was heard shouting \"call an election, you great big girl's blouse!\" at Corbyn, the Labour leader. Johnson also called a motion for an early general election, but he failed to get the votes. Needless to say, the motion is being brought back again on Monday: this is all reminding me very strongly of May, who also absolutely refused to take 'no' for an answer. Only politicians get to have as many votes as they want: the general public must abide by a single vote they made 3 years ago. On a more positive note, some brilliant speeches have been made. The standout one for me was made by a Labour MP, Jess Phillips. Oh, and Johnson is now a minority government :D (The main reason he is so desperate for an election. He's cornered at every step of the way unless he can get a majority back.)*sees time* I'd better go >.>",

In fact, you can't escape it. Politics is discussed everywhere, from daytime and nighttime talk shows, the workplace, to family gatherings. I don't know much about the  intricacies of Brexit, but I can totally relate to the fear some people in UK have as to what's happening in their country.Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 9/5/2019 2:40:22 PM (GMT-6)",

On the surface everything is carrying along as normal. But the political situation is absolutely bizarre and not something that anyone could have predicted even 3 years ago, I reckon. The amount of unintentional farce this week alone could keep a satirist in material for years. Anyway, the good news is the House of Lords passed the Benn bill which blocks no deal by forcing Johnson to ask the EU for an extension by the 19th October at the latest. The bad news is that Johnson has said he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than not leave on the 31st October (while a poor policewoman passed out behind him), which will create a very interesting legal situation if he disobeys the law. In other front page news, I broke my phone! ;_; The battery was failing, so I ordered a new one and tried to replace it. The old battery was stuck down with glue and I scratched a flat ribbon underneath it trying to prise it out. Put the new battery in anyway and hoped it would work. The phone gamely tried to power up, but alas it gave up the unequal struggle for existence and passed out like the policewoman above. I'm thinking of having a go at replacing the ribbon, just for the fun of it, but in the meantime I've ordered a new phone. I highly doubt I can get the old phone working again, but if I do, I can use it as a back up or give it to my brother. The new phone is a Pixel 3. I do hope it will be okay. Google phones have a reputation for being buggy, but this one had all the main things I was looking for - reasonable size/not massive, notch-free (I don't care if bezels are 'sooo 2015', I hate notches), fast processor, excellent camera, etc. And I managed to get it for under \u00a3500 from eBay. It should be arriving on Monday.Okay folks. I hope you have a good weekend. My back and stomach are hurting, so I'm gonna go and lie down in bed. Got almost no sleep last night (I was suffering from phone withdrawal symptoms! >.>), so I'm pretty tired now.",

I, however, pay close attention now as some of the policies/laws under the current administration have directly impacted my life and many others.I can definitely empathize with you about the political climate. I am very afraid of what is happening here socially and culturally; hate crimes and bigotry is on the rise, and  people's civil liberties are slowly being eroded.There is definitely a shift in social and cultural norms, and even morals.

I suppose the \"good\" news is that since Johnson succeeded in suspending parliament (not only succeeded but brought it forward 3 days - it wasn't meant to happen until Thursday), I will have less to follow :/ But yeah, doesn't really reassure me much. On a slightly less doom 'n' gloom note, my new phone arrived! I'm pretty happy with it so far; some things are a definite improvement. For example, I get 4G now and it's much faster. I've got a fingerprint sensor. I've got an in-built night light that actually works and is so much better than the blue light filter app I had on my previous phone (it wasn't the app's fault to be fair: the Android 8 update broke it). Only thing that doesn't seem much cop so far is the battery life. It's by no means dire, but I think my previous phone had a longer battery life when I first used it. *sees time* Okay I'm off to bed now. Should be going to Whipsnade zoo tomorrow with my mum. I'll see if I can take some decent pictures with my new phone :pPS: Irish passport. Yes, I'm still intending to get one. As I only have an Irish grandparent, and not parent, I have to apply for Irish citizenship first. I've done that but the waiting times are formidable: up to 12 months. I'm hoping that as mine is a pretty straightforward case and I've supplied all the correct documents, witnessed and signed by a notary, that mine will be processed faster than that. But yeah, I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner to be honest. On the bright side, the applications are processed in Dublin, so whatever happens here shouldn't affect that at least. Now I'm really off. Goodnight folks. Hope you are all well. Take care.Post Edited (NiceCupOfTea) : 9/11/2019 5:24:54 PM GMT",

So I would encourage you to make plans with your friend, whether it be just for a walk, for coffee, or something else you think she might enjoy.  Ask her if she wants to talk about the death.

There are so many others but they can all become addictive.  I went off Xanax for awhile and then my anxiety got high again, but I take a very low dose.  I snuck over to A/P and found the thread we were talking on before.  I remember you just started Lexapro again.  It is still helping me.  I haven't felt the need for an increase.  But I do take 100 mg of Pristiq too.  That is another option for you.  SNRI, they have anti anxiety properties in them so they help some too.  So far Lexapro is the only SSRI that I haven't gotten side effects from.  I tried about five others and there were so many side effects.  I like it so far.Good luck with the new PCP.  I am glad you could get a fairly early appointment.  I need to see mine too.  I been going to the psychologist and the diabetes doctor and forgot to make an appointment with my PCP.  I haven't seen him in about eight months.  It kind of stinks to have to see so many doctors.  I was seeing a foot doctor too but I got sick of going so much.  Plus I saw some bad reviews on him on face book.  I will find a new one.I hope you do get some help with the anxiety.  I know the thought of benzos can be scary.  In my opinion, Xanax is the safest for me.  I guess everybody is different.  I hope you have a good rest of the day.  Looks like rain here.Hugs, Karen...",

Going to work when you aren't sleeping well and are having dry heaves is probably not a good idea, imho.  Concentrate on getting the help you need, and tell whichever doctor sees you the full range of your problems.  I imagine he/she would then be more than willing to prescribe you something to help.  Don't hesitate to come back to the forum for more support.  I for one have gotten so much help on this website through the years.",

I also second someone else's suggestion to draw or do something similar.  I'm no artist but I find \"drawing my feelings\" helps.Also, reaching out to friends.  Some can listen to me talk about depression.  Some can't.  Needless to say, I don't reach out to friends who don't understand depression or tell me to \"snap out of it\".

We are hoping to buy a house next year and then i can get a small dog which i've wanted for so long. I feel so useless and lazy when I get like that. I feel so drained and tired.

Last night, my temporary job told me, via email, that my job was over which I didn't expect as I thought it would last longer.I now may need to postpone my root canal as I can't afford $2000; I was counting on being employed and using my paycheck to pay for it. To top it off, my back and hip are hurting me (I was struck by a car in 2017 and sustained nerve impingement and disc herniation and bulges). I don't even have money to see a chiropractor!I'm so sick of this crap!  Everything is just piling up, and I'm getting overwhelmed. I realize the main source of my frustration is lack of money. I've applied for full-time jobs, but I get no responses. Yes, I know I need to keep pushing through, but I get so demoralized. It is hard to get a full-time job given the extreme competition and crappy economy which I knew wasn't doing great. I don't mean to have a 'poor me' attitude, but I'm so fed up!",

I wouldn't be surprised if it was even cheaper in other European countries, in fact I would expect it to be.

Still don\u2019t have my mind made up on  Ect.  Not sure what I\u2019m doing but maybe with less medicines I\u2019ll be able to get to a clearer answer.   Not sure.   Day by day.  They (doctors ) mean well but they don\u2019t know our day by days, hour by hour feelings, so they can only make guesses as to what might help.  Blahhh",

                "comment": "Hi again HW people, I think I\u2019m going to go through with it.  I did some research, spoke to some friends and family.   I have to get some sort of a life back and medicines aren\u2019t helping me.  While i do go to therapy, that\u2019s about all i do and that just isn\u2019t a life for me.  I know this because when I\u2019m not depressed, i love life and doing things and being with people. Docs have suggested bi polar might be in my mix. Anyway. I\u2019m afraid because other major treatments have not worked for me. So again it\u2019s like a trial...    i always think that it\u2019s like my fault i have depression, it\u2019s a me thing.  That the medicines aren\u2019t working cause i don\u2019t have the same depression or anxiety that most have.  Anyone ever get like that?  My therapist is trying to help me see that it\u2019s my genetics plus life experiences that make me, me:   But if i could make the \u201chealthier\u201d or more positive choice i would, but That\u2019s exactly what my issue is.  I can see both options but i default to the \u201cbed and covers\u201d  Today I\u2019m all sad, the relentless crying and I\u2019ve tried breathing, taking a walk, watching something positive on youtube, tv, and just sitting with the awful feelings and let them pass by. Coming on here and reading and now typing out some venting.    But it doesn\u2019t make me feel better.  I\u2019m doing this cycle consistently.   It\u2019s so hard and demanding and I\u2019m sick n tired of being sick n tired.   Ughhh, just venting... i guess it\u2019s better to do so with some people who might understand a bit. I hope if ur reading/browsing this site, like I\u2019ve spent plenty of time doing that something eases up or lifts off of you for a little, that some goodness prevails.   I saved a little bird from my parents\u2019 filter in their pool.  Not that it was so difficult to do, but it made me happy. I actually felt happiness and when i went back to check and see if the little guy left the area where i placed him in the woods, he was gone, I pictured him away flying or with his family safe. I def heard a concerned family member squawking when i was handling him.   My dr says i shouldn\u2019t wish to extend the good feeling, cause that\u2019s how depression works. It feeds on the non happy times making it worse and unhealthy.  Instead be proud that i saved the little bird, took some action.   In my head i hope n pray that something \u201cgood\u201d will happen for me then.    That\u2019s my truth, i know it must sound like a jerk, but sometimes hope is all i have...

Letting them go was the hardest part.  But I did it.Have you ever taken one of the tests to find out what meds work best for you?  I can't remember what they are called.  Try the ECT and see what happens.  I know it is a big decision and scary.  But when that is all you have left, it is worth trying.Keep us posted on what you decide and how it goes.  I wish the best for you Oranged.  We all just want to feel better.  Depression stinks...Have a good day...Hugs, Karen...",

I was also not able to fall asleep until 4am and had a lot of relentless crying.  I got a few more hours sleep and although i still \u201cfeel\u201d the same i also do feel a smidge \u201clighter.\u201d Hard to explain. But in reality, i sent out some texts to people (which i normally not would have) and decided to post here as well.  I wanna have one spot specifically about ECT so i can remember the facts.  Woke up with same jaw, throat back pain but nothing horrible and I\u2019m sure Tylenol will help.  Have a bunch more rounds to do but wanted to see how the first one would go or if I\u2019d even make it to the hospital. I didn\u2019t even have to take my anxiety medicine before going.... think my mind is overpowering nerves and wants to me to feel alive and worthy of living.

But at least i could appreciate the goodness i felt yesterday.  It would have been awesome if it continued.... but ya know, hoping gets u no where.  I planned out the rest of the month to get more procedures. Today is like a i wanna be in bed all day but i also don\u2019t.  I just don\u2019t know what to do. Then i get anxious thinking about,,,, if i went for a hike... or if i asked a friend to get coffee..:    NOT ready for that yet but again, hoping, i will feel like myself soon and more sociable.  For now, texting is working for me. I\u2019m also curious as to what my therapist will say about everything, she usually helps me sort things.  Hello kramersmom-As i sit im thinking about whether to go to my family\u2019s for dinner tonight.  Celebrating parents 48th anniversary!  That\u2019s a long marriage lol.   I understand what u mean about isolation...:  they\u2019re the one who love me regardless, yet sometimes i wanna be the furthest from them.  I wanna feel good and wholesome and then go to the \u201cdinner.\u201d   It\u2019s an annoying cycle.   Supposedly going and being there for as long as i can is supposed to help, but Why can\u2019t laying in bed do the same? Lol but not lol.   Hope u enjoy some Sunday !

When i got home, i slept a lot.  Not really sure how i feel feel.  Think I\u2019ll knowMore tomorrow when i wake up.  My next appointment is Friday.   I think it feels like my brain got zapped hah.  I did have troubleRemembering some things right there while i was waiting and on the ride home but luckily my fam had the answers for me.

I did the intense route where u go frequently for a few weeks and i can recall coming home one day and calling my friends saying meet me out... i wanna go out after a year of staying home.

I\u2019m in the 1 percentile of these severe and rare side effects. I was hospitalized 2 1/2 out of 4 months, trying a half dozen anti-depressants. It\u2019s been a long journey and I\u2019m finally feeling a little bit better. I have developed bradycardia, resting 45-50 bpm, since I\u2019ve been taking Lexapro 20 mg. I\u2019m also on Gabapentin 100 mg, 2 x/day and buspar 10 mg, 2x/day. My docs attribute it to being athletic all my life but, I\u2019m 52 yo and have never had such a low pulse.

I definitely understand how  financially scary it can be when you're not working. However, your emotionally health is more important right now.  Hopefully, your unemployment benefits will be able to provide a financial cushion for a while.Have you found a therapist yet? If not, maybe you could try online counseling.

I don't think a few months off would drastically hinder your chances of getting another job, but I do take your point. Would you consider a part time voluntary job just to keep your hand in and your confidence up whilst you are looking for a paid job? It would also look 'better' to some employers, but I wouldn't let that be your main consideration.

Unless a person is on Instagram, twitter, or one of the new ones that I don't even remember the names,  people do not bother you.  Even facebook is kinda dying off.

A significant change must happen.  So not matter if you have done a job before or not,  you have the skills right? Change is scary,  but it can be freeing at the same time!  Think about the control and independence you could have in your life if you could work from home.  Think about the skills you previous job gave you, people skills, task processing, attention to detail,  good communication,  you can type, computer skills obviously,  ability to learn to things.

Did you reschedule?If your husband does not want to attend grief therapy, maybe you should just go alone. Your husband may not be ready to open up and share what he is going through. You can only work on yourself at this point, and hopefully, your husband will follow suit.Working at home seems like a good idea. Do you have a home office?Also, volunteering is also great. From what I read, some people take great enjoyment in volunteering at dog shelters. Supposedly, dogs (and I guess other animals) have a calming effect on people under intense stress.",

Some of techniques suggested are writing a letter telling your love one how you feel about his or her passing, and your goals for the future. The article also suggested creating a memory book, journaling, or art therapy where you draw or paint how you feel.Maybe, you could do one of these things until you find another grief counselor?I'm so sorry you are going through this.

                "comment": "Hello, I\u2019m new to this forum and before writing this I got some good information from the pinned thread and had read another mans concerns with his wife\u2019s depression. I personally do not know where to start, but recently a little over a week ago things took a turn so quickly my head is still spinning. I\u2019m so confused, heartbroken, frustrated, I don\u2019t ever ask for help, but I\u2019m not getting any from parents on either side. I told her parents that we need to be a \u201crock\u201d for her, a strong foundation. It right now looks like I\u2019m going to be alone in the healing process,She had told me she had been depressed for around 2 months (either I\u2019m blind or she was hiding it), I started to notice her over worrying 10-11 days ago. It\u2019s hard to give a exact time because weeks have been feeling like days and all of them are blurred. Last Wednesday I do remember however, because my wife and I were sorting out the laundry on our bed, myself on one side and her on the other. She stopped out of the blue and puts her hands on the bed and it looked like she was just tired or maybe thinking about something. Then she lets out a pain like noise as if your gut turned and she fainted. I was caught off guard I ran over and started patting her cheek calling her name, she came to and after about 10 min of sitting and holding her, she was ready enough to lay in bed. She fell asleep and would wake up asking if this and that got done and I would tell her \u201cyes, it\u2019s all done let\u2019s get some sleep\u201d, she would fall asleep and she would wake up again asking the same question, I would respond with the same answer. This loop happened probably 8 times in about 45 min time. From that night on everything changed drastically, I\u2019m dealing with 2 different people it feels like. Since that little scare her attitude is like a light switch and I\u2019m on egg shells because ANYTHING can set her off. I quickly learned when she throws verbal punches to just let them roll off, i\u2019ve recognized when her mood has changed because she can\u2019t think straight, talk coherently, and feels like I need to be lectured on how things need to happen. Common sense is absent at these points and it\u2019s all rambling. I take a deep breath and just take it. She worries about the past and the next day, little things turn into massive giants( such as getting the kids ready for school), night time recently have been real bad because of those worries. She has punched walls (more then once) and slammed her head on the cabinet (one time). She says she needs my help and when I ask what can I do to help, she tells me nothing and to just go away and that\u2019s just one of many wants but doesn\u2019t want. I\u2019m dealing with a double edged sword and it\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019m doing everything I can to stay strong when she can\u2019t be, I dread coming home because who knows what lays in wait for me. Our kids (6 and 4) do not seem to be showing any sadness or reflecting how they are seeing mama, I had told my wife, \u201cwe need to get you checked out\u201d, ohhhhh how naive I am to say such a stupid thing, I feel lucky to be tying this now. But I manned up and told her I want her in to have a check up, get blood work done and check blood pressure and so on, then we will take steps from there to tackle this thing. She wants nothing to do with it. She thinks there is nothing that will come of it, I told her it\u2019s a starting point. I am very tired, but staying strong I think. She is trying to handle it herself which in turn is breaking us down. She is not on any meds for anything. I don\u2019t know if this is a combination of past guilt and repetition of day to day life or just the daily repetition. Her eating is so minimal it makes her sick. I\u2019m sorry I gotta stop, I can keep going, it\u2019s late and I hope I made sense enough. Thanks to all in advance",

This morning she woke up crying, apologizing about how yesterday went and I told her everything was fine and it\u2019s a closed book now. I told her let\u2019s have a good day today. She still feels sick for lack of eating and worrying so much. Her little \u201cepisodes\u201d, if I handle them the right way, it comes and goes in around 5-10 min (sometimes can be back to back). But it literally sucks the energy from me and pulls me down. We or I will have to figure out a good time (if there is one) to at least get her checked and have a starting point. She is trying to convince herself this is normal, it\u2019s not. She doesn\u2019t need to live like this. Truly it is odd that her mentality changed considerably after the faint. This place has a lot of information here and I\u2019m going to keep a open mind while sitting through the forum, I want answers soo badly so I can do my part better. Firecrackers are turned into nukes in her mind. It\u2019s tough for me but I know it\u2019s much harder for her. Thank you for your prayers wearyRAsufferer, I\u2019m praying to.",

I also have experience taking care of my father who has Bipolar disorder. Your wife needs to be seen by someone ASAP. It can often be difficult to get in to see a psychiatrist so I would recommend she start with her primary doctor. They can usually refer much quicker. She is exhibiting concerning behavior along with the depressive symptoms. If you feel she could be a danger to herself or others at any time or feel she is out of control either take her to the hospital or call 911 and they will come and take her to the ER to be evaluated. You can see if there are emergency mental health services in your area (usually it\u2019s a screener) who you can contact if she is in crisis and they can send someone to the home to talk to her. When in doubt call 911- hard to do I know I\u2019ve been there but you have two young kids to think about and she needs professional help ASAP. If you feel you need to do any of the above you can ask a friend or family member to watch your kids so they aren\u2019t around if you need to hospitalize her. Also make sure you are getting some support for yourself as well and asking for help from friends and family. I hope this is helpful and I am sending prayers your way. Michelle",

Not trying to scare you but just play it safe because she sounds very mentally ill and unstable. All you can do is the best you can to get her help and keep you and the kids safe.

You're not too old to get help.  You deserve to learn how to cope with depression and other mental health issues just as much as younger people do.",

Thus, weight lifting may be on a par with drug therapy in combating depression in seniors, according to geriatrician Dr. Nalin Singh of Sydney\u2019s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. In the study, which involved 60 men and women averaging 72 years of age, even those who did low-intensity exercises experienced \u201ca 30 per cent drop in depression, the same as those who did not lift weights but received standard medical care,\u201d says The Australian. Besides fighting depression, weight lifting strengthens \u201cageing bones and muscles, helping older people avoid falls. It also helps control arthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure,\u201d says the paper. Singh suggests that weight lifting \u201cshould be offered as a primary treatment for depression, especially for older people.\u201d\"",

I hope you find something in there to help.Are you seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?  Do you take any medications?  Seeing a therapist really helps a lot.  Do you have insurance for mental health?  If you don't, look for a clinic that works on a sliding scale.  A lot of them do.  Also there are a lot of good books on depression that can guide you.  Know you are beginning a healing journey.  Once you address it, you are on your way.  I hope some of what I have written will help.  Most of us go to therapy and a lot of us take medications.  You can talk here too.  There are many members who understand what you are going through.  But yes, asking for help is your first step to getting better.  I hope you have a good evening.Hugs, Karen...",

Make the out breath a little longer than the in breath.  It is called smelling the roses and blowing out the candles.  Repeat this over and over and it will help with the anxiety.  IT takes practice.  Learn a little meditation too.  IT helps when you are thinking too much as many of us do.  Learn to live in the moment.  This helps with depression and anxiety.  They say: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery.  Today is a gift, that is why it is called the present.  Learning to live in the moment or the now keeps you from dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  Being anxious is no fun.  We all go through it, but it can be controlled.As I asked before, do you have any sources of support?  Doctor, therapist?  Hugs, Karen...",

My mother was inpatient for many years and at that time it was not talked about as it was a real huge deal.  People thought she was \"crazy\" and the stigma of it really sucked.  I guess what I am saying is I think that there was a lot of depression (and alcoholism too) but no one would admit to it.  Especially men, as they were suppose to be so strong.  Anyhow, it is more discussed these days and more acceptable in society.  Which is good because there is much more help for people who are mentally ill or depressed.  Just my thoughts on the subject.

The things that pull me out, and this could take a couple of days, however I try to stick to repeating until it works:hold ice over the sink until it hurts 6 sec maybe,  then 3 cleansing breaths.    deep breath, raise arms shoulder height then let breath with a noise exhale and just drop arms. get outside for 10min.  I sit out back even if it is just on the step for 10 mins, sometimes I even time it if I am bad. The light and fresh air will eventually work unless there is a medical reason you can go out.eventually I get back to walking. I have 2 dogs and this gets me up and out of bed, does not get me off the couch necessarily, but I do need to let them out and feed them.  Petting and cuddling them helps.  The unconditional love is a medicine that can not be bought.I understand some people are not pet oriented, so perhaps a small fish tank with 2 fish,  this has been proven to be relaxing and  reduces anxietyI use mindfulness and meditation.  Insight timer is a free downland for your phone and has lots of helpful stuff. Alsohttps://mindful.org is a good site.  Search is in top right corner.When I could not get out of the dark places and was inpatient,  I had a long talk with a compassionate nurse.  She suggested I do things I was told I was to stupid to do when I was young.  I am 58 now.  so...I am teaching myself piano, using books and youtube.  I have a $200 keyboard.  I do it when I feel like it and enjoy it.I started messing around with paints on cardboard just to release some emotions, and I now enjoy painting.  I even sell one every so often.  I paint what I feel, when I feel it.  I have no training.  I sew, embroider,  needle point, crochet  Post for donations on the neighborhood website,  collect hats, gloves, blankets for a mens shelter and The Covent house near me.   Also yarn to make hats for both. Try to find a support group.  I attend one for mental illness.  Mostly biopolar attends, but there are people with my dx's. Been going for 5 yrs.  Just making a few good friends.  Depression and other things makes it hard for me to trust.  Took a year for me to get comfortable in the group.  It was so worth it to stick it out!!Lately I have begun going out to lunch with a friend from my support group.  I hope some of this helps you. Peace and strengthTrina",

Because I am sitting outside and the Planes are flying low, low, low over my house which is unusual.  The first time, I thought the plane was in trouble!  Site indicated that routes will return to normal by noon today. With so much rain this year, the ants are bad here.  All over the place, silver fish in the house, they eat the spiders.   I put mint oil around to chase the spiders out,  Saw a huge thousand leggier and it ran under the stove before I could get it.  Maybe they eat the spiders I can't remember.Tip for All:  When you are outside,  but a fan on, creates a breeze enough to give the bugs away!Had to do mindful breathing and ice to calm down on that one.  Have not seen it since.  That was 3 weeks ago. I do not like bugs in my house.  Grant it, I live nice to woods, still I don't like them.

Probably an implant.I will definitely do something - my jaw muscles have a tendency to tighten and 'cause issues if I do the \"chew on one side\" thing.  Plus I don't want the remaining teeth moving around messing up bite and appearance.The bridge seems to require shaving down the neighboring teeth and putting crowns on them to anchor the replacement crown.  This seems to need repair/replacement in about 20 years. It can pull the 2 good teeth in toward the middle, thus also alignment issues.  Plus what is under the \"new\" crown to provide support if you bite down?The implant is a post into bone, with a crown on that. The more expensive option but very rarely requires work later. More sturdy for eating, better at holding other teeth in place, better for the health of the underlying jawbone.I have learned that the older you get, the more things you encounter that you never thought about in youth.  So then you have to learn a whole new language to deal with whatever-it-is.  I learned about laws and the court system in the divorce-from-hell, learning about a variety of mouth specialists, etc, in this case, learned about the body, Drs, and the autoimmune system with my Lupus....At least this morning looks pretty, so maybe it will be a better day!",

When I fall the first thing I do is check to see if anyone saw me and then I check to see if I've hurt myself.  How are you getting along?Jamie, my theory is that as get older, we have more things to remember and it takes longer to sift through all that stuff so it seems like our memory is going.  I think there is some research to back this up.  So don't worry, you aren't useless, you are full of memories.  I just got back from spending the weekend at my husband's hemp farm.  The whole family was there, which was fantastic and made me feel good.  And 4 dogs, one of whom sleeps near my head and snores gently.  The coyotes were howling close by - very western.  If you look at a map of Colorado and find Alamosa down south, it's very close to there.Back to work tomorrow.  I will spend the night up there, which is a little pricey, but makes a big difference in my fatigue level.Have a good evening everyone.Kathy",

I have along time friend in Ohio,  I live in NJ.  He has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  I send him music clips from Youtube.  Music was/is something we shared.  Wife says he exhausted from chemo and has a 3% chance of survival.    I pray the music gives him some comfort.  Music and cathartic in so many ways.Pitmom, so much rain this year, I have not watered anything!  And I had the spigot out front fixed. Still need to hose for it.  Used the watering can when I planted the perennials and the annuals.  Transplanted the two new azaleas I put in last year.    I can not keep up with the front garden any longer so I am letting the grass take over except for the  evergreen ground bushes and the small gardens by the walk way between driveway and front door.   This will give me time and energy to keep the bushes nicely trimmed and shoots cut from bottom. HT,  I and thinking of you and praying you get the memory appointment.   Although I have a hunch it could be the neck and PTSD.   For I have memory issues also..Glad to hear you had nice visit with Mom.

Has a break up with his girlfriend and never comes back to do the brake line.

Pulled the cushions off and started to run the machine but there was stuff that wasn't lifting off by the vaccuum.  Flea eggs!  I got out the spray and sprayed each and every one.  I'll have to strip the slipcover off and get it to the laundromat...when the truck can be driven.I'm struggling.It's still humid, though not quite so hot, but still weighing me down.My new hibiscus is blooming!  Dark foliage, white petals swirled with pink and a deep burgundy eye!  The petals on the oak leafed hydrangea have changed from white to pink to burgundy and now are browning.  The cuphea that attracted the hummingbird is finished so I'll have to find something else for those pots.

Since hubby left, when I caught if cheating, almost 1.5 now.  My hard earned trust basis is bottomed out again.  I think the rest of life will be solitary.  I will be content. PH.d.  I am impressed. Pitmom,   I am sorry about your truck,  but more anxious for you about the FLEAS!  Yikes!!I have to admit that I am totally annual about my 2 dogs, keeping the clean and flea free.  This year I am giving the monthly chewable instead of the oil, much easier and it works. As for cars.   I have to give credit to John,  he does make sure my car is in good condition and I always have a newer model.  He understands the years I spent on my own, 18-29 when my cars died on me constantly.My car makes a noise and I get a panic attack now.  Silly I know, but there it is. I hope everyone has a nice day.  81 here today,  but humid.  Nice in the am,  meditated in am on patio planning on sitting out in twilight to read while dogs chase grass hoppers and butterflies.  Both are plentiful this year.Peace AllTrina",

I hope you get in to the memory clinic soon, so you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment if you need it.My younger son is here with his girlfriend and my grand dog.  I got to dog sit this afternoon, which only entailed giving him a few cookies and taking him out to pee.  It was rainy, or I would have taken him and my dog to the dog park.

I think if I ever got a tattoo I would want something unique, maybe a word or phrase spelled out using Japanese's characters.I'm feeling very anxious after watching different news outlets report that the country is heading into a recession. I always thought that the economy wasn't doing well despite contrary reports. On a lighter note, I have decided to stop dying my hair and embrace my grey. After watching videos of other women embracing their grey hair, and looking fabulous with it, I'm encouraged to stop wasting money on hair dyes which are probably damaging. The only problem is I have patches of grey in the front and side-not the back, so it may look weird.Have a good night everyone!Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 8/15/2019 8:49:38 PM (GMT-6)",

My wonderful husband and love of my life suddenly passed on 11/25/18.  He was walking the dog and apparently threw an embolism.  It has been almost 9 months and I get through each day.  That is about all I do.  I am stuck on 11/25/18 12:38 pm.  We were going to put up Christmas decorations after he finished his walk.  He was 64Our 65th birthdays came this year and our 29th anniversary but I had nothing to celebrate.  I try to remember the good times, look at pictures and bank on dreams coming to me.  Letting him go is impossible.Thank you for listening",

So far it is a lovely day here, but rain in the forecast.  I think I am going to walk before the rain starts.I'mtheMom,I am so sorry for your losses.  I lost my first husband in 2000 to lung cancer.  He was 58.  Too young...  I agree with Trina about grief support.  It may help you.  But it does sound like you are coping, though every little bit of help can make a difference in our lives.I hope you all have a great day.

                "comment": "Hello all.  Sorry I've been so infrequent here lately.  70 degrees and warmer is my 'best' time of year so, I've been busy.Last month, a woman came to our trailer park and took applications for food stamps and medicaid.  I told her I'd been denied so many times already for medicaid.  She told me they had put the applications in for the wrong program!  She helped me put in an application for the Aged, Blind and Disabled program this time.  Fingers crossed that I get approved.  Medicare doesn't cover dental but this Medicaid program is supposed to!The garden is still blooming nicely.  I have a few 'reblooming' day lilies, the tropical hibiscus and canna, the crepe myrtle bush and morning glories going strong!  The helenium bloomed nicely this year, too, and the dahlia is just getting started.  The oak leaf hydrangea blooms have faded to brown but they still look great and I can't wait to see how the leaves turn color yet.  I've added to my collection of sedum this year, too.  Found one that is supposed to bloom red.  So much still to come but I think I'll pick up some early mums for now to tide me over.Had another 'chat' with daughter and grandson about helping around the house.  She's taken it to heart but he's still being lazy and unmotivated.  Might have to turn off the wifi to get his attention!Daughter's weaning off hydrocortisone is going well, though.  She's down to just 7.5 mg a day!  She won't have more blood work done until October and we're hoping her cortisol will be good enough to come off the hc altogether.  The HRT has been helping in so many ways!  She has more energy and her blood sugars are coming down wonderfully since estrogen makes her more insulin sensitive!  Her body is trying so hard to get back to 'normal'.  They switched her off of Celexa and put her on Cymbalta hoping it will not only help her depression but also with pain.  We'll see.  So far, it's not looking great...they've had to up her to 60mg/day.  Doc wanted her at 80mg/day but insurance wouldn't pay, so it's 60mg/day for now.My kitty that had heat stroke is almost 100% recovered!  I seriously thought we were going to lose him...he was in such bad shape and no idea what happened!  He had disappeared for 36 hrs during one of the heat waves and was found laying on the patio drinking water from my fountain.  Unable to stand or walk!  Now, the only thing he can't do is jump up on the counter where I feed them, so I have to pick him up a couple of times a day but he's walking almost normal!  He sleeps with me every night now and sometimes gets in the tub, just to be left alone from the dogs I think!  Micah has taken to 'cleaning' him daily.  His head and neck will be soaked from her licking and his hair will be all spiked up like a rebellious teenager!  So funny to see!I fixed my own washing machine the other day.  'Someone' didn't check their pockets well and coins got in the wash...turns out a penny was stuck in the pump...horrible noise when the water would discharge.  We took the back off and my partner tilted the machine forward and held it while I took out the pump and got the penny out.  Reassembled the pump and she let the machine down and we put the back on again.  Good to go!  I've told daughter she can use the key card for the laundry room from now on, rather than my machines!  Portable washers have a shorter life span than regular machines as it is!That's about it for now...you've all been duly updated!",

But they will pay for the 30 mg pills.  Your daughter could talk to her doctor about going up to 90mg a day instead of 80mg.  I had the same problem.Andrina, for a surgeon to terminate you from his practice before you have recovered from a surgery that he did is not only unethical but could be considered abandonment.  However, I think you still need a new doctor, because how could you ever be comfortable with him again? I hope you find someone soon.Kathy",

I've found that if I don't get enough sleep I have side effects such as feeling breathless, light headed and dizzy.  At times my heart pounds.  Today has been really bad that I haven't felt comfortable driving - or really anything else.  I've set my alarm as a reminder to take it at 9pm. My concern is that several times over the next 3 weeks I'm looking after 2 babies (overnights and days) and I don't know what I should do.  I'm afraid that if I take my pill that I won't get enough sleep (if any!) and the side effects will be intense like today.  Should I skip my dose?  At this point it looks like it's 3 overnights in the 3 weeks.  What if I take it and it knocks me out that even screaming babies won't wake me?!  Any advice?

Mistakes and oops happen at the highest levels!  I always. asked myself if my bosses were so good at their jobs, why are they so unhappy and mean?  Why does my work end up be the buck stopper.  Do they not know their job?Many people in this world are promoted for the wrong reasons.May I suggest that you put a resume together, don't post in on the internet,  your boss might see it and make your job more miserable.    However,  look for jobs on there internet or search for companies you would like to work for.  The best jobs have not opened up yet!  Submit resume with a cover letter,  better yet, go to the business and ask to see the HR department. The person to person system still beats out the virtual.  Shows character and initiative.

Some are toxic and some are ok, with some toxic people in them.  My suggestions would be, seek out those people who seem happy or content, who support you even in your mistakes.  It's easy to get freaked out by a boss who is a blamer.  But that is just one person's opinion.  If she is shaming you, that can make you feel like a failure.  So as I said, find the content people and put more energy towards them.Another situation will present itself eventually where you have to proofread something, and I'm sure you'll be more careful.  The more \"pairs of eyes\" that look at it the better, especially if it is important.Just my ideas...",

He was in great pain.  It led me to thinking about my own pain that I carry around about AIDS.  Depending on how you count, I lost 25-40 friends and acquaintances to AIDS in the 1980's and 1990's and sometimes when I think back to those days, I get overwhelmed.One particular aspect of my grief is that a lot of times I don't want to leave the house.  And another aspect is that I don't have any gay friends here where I live.  I know I need to \"get out and do things\" so I can meet more people.I'm glad to have this resource (this message board).

Back  in the early 90's. I lived in Cleveland.  I would go to the hospital with my dog Maddie she was a therapy dog and we would visit the AIDS patients.  It always made me sad,  it was just the patients and staff no visitors.  Ignorance was so much a part of this disease and still is I believe.    Even the children in pediatrics,  the parents would be there but all covered up like mummies.  And there I was with Maddie, tot on my lap and Maddie licking the babe. One more sad era in America, the world.  HOWEVER Rich,  You and others survived and are here to teach others and to tell generations now, how it was and how it can be in the future.  I figure we owe it to people that passed.  All because society had tear down a rainforest.    So, when someone says to me,  \"Wow you were alive when AIDS hit!\" I make sure I tell people that part.  It was not a \"gay\" disease, the act of sex was the transmitter. Off my soap box now.Peace and strengthTrina",

                "comment": "AIDSI was at the peak of my life (so I thought), in my twenties, living at the beach near LA, and had a great job with a still flying legacy airline. I lost count of the number of very good friends, serious boyfriends, acquaintances and colleagues who either died slowly or were suddenly gone \u2013 a surprise from AIDS. Beyond the sadness of losing so many people in general, AIDS frightened me very much \u2013 because in the beginning it\u02bcs consequence was death. There are likely so many personal stories we both could share I\u02bcll forgo more details.I wasn\u02bct until after after 9-11 and a MS in Counseling (in 1997) that I began to realize how much AIDS changed my life. I was a direct report to the CFO and because an early retirement deal wasn\u02bct creating a suitable RIF, it was opened to all employees except officers. The next day I gave my boss a heads up I was retiring after 25 years. After I left I was struggling with life so much I could not care for myself. I lied during an intake interview to a state mental hospital by say yes to 3 questions that required my admittance. I was already diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder: Severe and they added PTSD, and GAD. I found relief for all three with Paxil and Xanax to the point I was able to slowly reduce and eliminate the MEDs. Realizing I had not set foot in a jet or been in airport since 1994 (it\u02bcs 2019 now) realized I was still in trouble. I figured out I relieved my earlier symptoms by eliminating everything that caused fear, anxiety and depression. It resulted in moving, losing contact with my friends and anything associated with commercial aviation. I only went out a night, didn\u02bct read mail or answer my phone. I tried a few new Psychiatrists but they wanted me to start from the beginning and prescribe MEDs I did not need and were not therapeutic. (Ambien, Prozac and half a half a 0.5mg of Klonopin).Fortunately my new PCP listened when when we spoke and agreed to my request for Wellbutrin XL (now 300mg) and 2mg of Xanax 2 X a day. After the Wellbutrin had kicked in and was effective, we reviewed the Xanax and reduced it to 1 mg up to twice a day as needed. Wellbutrin will be around for a while. The Xanax will probably end in November.I\u02bcm moving, plan to relearn how to non-rev, and I\u02bcm eager to have friends. I wasted years of my life alone and unhappy because I allowed the past to restrict my present and eliminate my future. Eventually peoples\u02bc perception of time changes. As a kid the last few minutes before the final bell took an eternity. Now, each day feels shorter adding another challenge to my life.Don\u02bct allow the fear, sadness, losses, and beliefs from your past control your current life. It\u02bcs especially problematic for those who were around during the rapid onset and growth of death by AIDs. You were surrounded by immense sadness and grief for years. Grief diminishes with time, but grief for a special one or few will remain. Whether your choice or not, it\u02bcs OK. Please end the fear and anger. It honors no one and holds you back. I\u02bcve just shared what I believe I\u02bcve done that had insignificant if not dangerous outcomes and probably exacerbated my desire, hope and ability to continue the life I lived and expected to continue until the end. If you\u02bcre not able to attain peace alone seek help. Turn to family, friends, forums, libraries, online sites and professionals such as medical doctors , psychiatrists and counselorsIn the grand scheme, life is short. Determine if some changes will improve your quality of life. If obstacles remain, attempt to force your self, if that\u02bcs not happening, seek help from your phone. FaceTime from Apple, Google\u02bcs Hangout and new app called Duo which works with FaceTime. Most people use Facebook and they have Messenger. Worried about quality? Use the Doctors on Demand App. It\u02bcs by Dr Phil and besides medical doctors, it can quickly connect you with a psychiatrist, psychologist, or Counselor. Keep in mind Medicare is not accepted.I still have farther to go, but after 2 lousy shrinks and 3 Doctors who didn\u02bct let me talk I finally found doc with ears who wants to hear me speak. I wouldn\u02bct presume to say I know how you feel, but if my experience helps in any way, I just passed forward something wonderful a stronger did for me. I hope you figure it out and find help from people who want to hear everything you want and NEED to say.ScoutPost Edited (I8aapple) : 8/10/2019 3:17:13 PM (GMT-6)",

I remember the days when I had to filled out paper forms; I really miss those days. I'm so annoyed and getting anxious as this company's database is confusing to navigate. (I sent an email to HR about it).Ugh...why does everything have to be online now. Don't get me wrong, technology have many positive attributes (such as forums like this and spreading information), but it has many negatives as well. IMO technology is 'dumbing-down' people so much that we can't think or analyze things for ourselves.  Also, I don't understand why people are so glued to their cellphones. When I'm commuting to or from work, the first thing that I see are people on their cellphones, either watching movies, texting, etc. I didn't have a cellphone when I was growing up, and guess what, I survived.Then there is social media, such as Facebook or Twitter. I don't understand why people like to post everything about their lives on social media. Maybe I'm just cranky, but I don't understand the appeal of certain things.Sorry for the rant, but I'm just so annoyed, and I feel my anxiety rising!",

I am also very concern about fraud and identity theft, when filling out these forms online, due to database breaches.And yes, fraud and identity theft have always existed, but it seems to be more on the rise due to the expanding use of technology.You say that \" We are freed from rudimentary toil to concentrate our efforts on other things. Think of the sciences for example.\" Hmmm...exactly what 'rudimentary toil' has technology freed us from? You also say \"people are glued to their cell phones because people generally like to have their mind active. 30 years ago you could not even see fellow commuters faces because everyone had a newspaper in front of their faces.\"I can see how  it could keep a person's mind active, but I can also see how it could turn a person's mind into mush.  However, there are bigger concerns, namely safety. When I commute in and out of work, I see people so glued to their cellphones that they bump into other people, which has caused some fights, or worse, they don't even look away from it when crossing the street.As to humans being social animals, I agree.

I always encourage other people to believe in themselves and I give pretty darn good advice to everyone (except myself) but even with all the effort i make, it's becoming really apparent that people still find me intolerable to be around and it's really making me wonder what the point of my life is if i don't even have friends who enjoy my company.I am negative when i talk about myself, if someone asks me how i am and whether i've got a boyfriend yet my typical repsonse is probably 'Ah, you know, i'm ok and no, of course i haven't got a boyfirend, i'll never get a boyfriend!'. I tend to then breeze past talking anymore about me or my feelings because i know that it's negative and therefore i try and just talk about the other person all the time in order to be good company.I've noticed more and more of my 'friends' saying things to me like 'You need to learn to be happy', 'Maybe you didn't have a good time because you're always so miserable' 'Maybe you felt like she was being off with you because you're always paranoid and make things up in your head. You're just jealous because they're happy and you're not'. And although these people still then class themselves as my friends, i'm wondering if they really are friends if my negativity is so obvious and unbearable. It's making me not want to socialise because i feel like i either have to avoid talking about myself totally, or i have to put on a fake face and be like 'yeah i'm great, i'm so happy and love my life!' in order to please them.I really feel like i go out of my way to always support other people and be positive about them and their stories so i'm really disheartened to hear that so many people still see me as draining and negative.I'm totally lost in my life now as i've been down about my ex and unable to move on for years but now i feel like i don't want to see mates either which means i've literally got nothing.",

Try to avoid \"I'll never...\" or \"I always...\"  Those are weights and chains that keep us in the pit.  Start the day believing that something good is going to happen...then at the end of the day, review the day and find that good thing.  Most of us don't win the lottery but even if I have to say \"At least I didn't spend the whole day in bed so, that's a good thing that happened today.\" it's enough.It takes practice and fortitude, but it does work!",

The people-pleasing will never attract good people, only superficial types who can dish out the criticism but can't receive it in return. More importantly, at a psychological level, people-pleasing behaviour makes people respect you less, not more. It's counterintuitive but that is absolutely how human psychology works. Can you afford therapy? I think a good therapist could get to the roots of why you feel you are less important than other people (because that's basically what it amounts to). As for the \"negativity\", it is a core symptom of depression. My advice would be to drop your friends and concentrate on you. Do what pleases/interests you for a change. Once you start to feel a bit better (perhaps with the aid of an antidepressant or therapy), you can start working on longer term goals to try to break the rut and move on from the stifling past.",

I also had to learn to tell myself, would you give up your good qualities to get rid of your bad qualities (like being nervous)? I thought, no.Would you rather be somebody else? No. I really didn't want to be like them. Your talk about being negative sounds like one of the issues I had, until I read a column about being positive. And it really helped.",

When we do this,  people around us get uncomfortable.  We become a mirror and they do not like what they see. I had lost every friend I had when my neurologist sent me to a therapist, because I told her 10yrs ago, my pain was making me suicidel.  True.  But there was a lot of other stuff going on also. I was just not a party person anymore.  People did not like that.  No one wanted to stick it out through the tough times.  Even my husband of 20 yrs I found out last years started cheating so he could still party.Thank God I am strong enough now to move on.  I have true friends now that will not move on, and would desert them either. Mindfulness helps me a great deal.  So does self compassion.  Heck if you would tell some else to do something nice and good for themselves, would you not deserve the same thing?I suggest mindful.org and seeing what might help you there.

Most of my friends came into my life at different turning points or pivotal times in my life.I use to get upset that I don't speak to most of them anymore, but looking  back I think they were briefly in my life for a purpose; when that purpose became fulfilled, we drifted apart or realized that we had nothing in common anymore.I think it's hard to develop deep, meaningful friendship, especially at a certain age, and with our illnesses, but it's not impossible although it may take some time.Have you tried meet-up groups? Often people make friends with those, who have similar interests or hobbies.If your religious, you might want to try meeting people at religious organizations, i.e. church, synagogues, etc; I recently started going to church and am meeting new people.Whatever you do, don't give up on making friends.Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 6/4/2019 9:20:16 PM (GMT-6)",

For a start, most depressed people don't tend to want to talk much, even if they are horribly lonely - making small talk can feel as exhausting as Sisyphus rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity. However if you continue to feel lonely, there is a real risk of that leading to depression sooner or later. So I would encourage you to keep trying to meet people. It is hard to be honest - most of my old forums have died out. But consider forums or groups which are related to your interests. If you play games, there is an internet community for most games. It may help to just lurk for a while and get a 'feel' for the place - that way you can decide if the people actually interest you or not before joining.

You never know with whom you might identify and find support.On the other hand, loneliness can extend even onto the Internet and the different support sites. On a couple I visit, there are clearly groups of users who are on the same wavelength and \"click\" with one another to provide support when needed. I think some of the typical forum features, like friends lists, followers, and up-voting, inadvertently make others feel like outsiders. At least on some user profiles there it says \"Your friends list is empty\", as opposed to \"You have no friends\", which I guess would be even more unintentionally damaging to the psyche.In any case, the point is that one needs to be active and seeking out others on these forums. Your active participation -- posts, replies, reactions, votes, etc. -- is the only way others are even aware of you. I'm not especially good at this, as I have some loner tendencies, so it's not working in my favor. Many others seem to have a natural ability to interact and be \"popular\" on the forums. I guess it's just like real life in any other context.",

                "comment": "Yes, I know. Me and good news are an oxymoron <_<. On a serious note, I was in a pretty bad downward spiral. My eye issues tipped me over the edge: I became convinced I would never be able to see properly again. I would have panic attacks about losing my sight altogether and becoming completely blind, and no amount of reason could counter the cold-blooded fear at 3am. Thus I was pessimistic and scared of my upcoming cataract operation. It loomed like a Damocles sword over my head for months. On top of that, my Crohn's was playing up: hello, nocturnal trips to the toilet 3x a night. Piss off, nocturnal trips to the toilet 3x a night.Anyway, I finally had the dreaded operation yesterday. I read Animal Farm on my Kindle whilst waiting for the operation, because there's nothing like a good depressing political allegory to make you even more depressed (brilliant book though). I was surprisingly anxiety-free until I was wheeled into the operating theatre, whereupon I became terrified that I would get an urge to have a BM during the procedure! Supposing I moved whilst the surgeon was cutting into my eye? Whilst they did the pre-op preparations, I lay there completely still and dared my bowels to so much as even hint at an urge. Then another thought occurred to me: would my vision go completely dark during the surgery? I turned to worrying about that instead, and my bowels and body remained completely still the entire time. No, my vision never went dark. The intolerable glare of the overhead light turned into 3 fuzzy yellow lights floating above me. There was a distant sound of a drill or a saw. I never saw or felt anything go into my actual eye - just those 3 yellow lights constantly moving all over the place. After a few minutes, I was able to relax a little and the intense fear receded. Afterwards I was wheeled out into the discharge lounge with a patch over my right eye. My parents and my mum's friend picked me up from the hospital. I wasn't allowed to take the patch off until the next morning. The immediate impression was one of confusion and of being underwhelmed. It wasn't until my dad got to me read a license plate across the road and persuaded me I could see well enough to drive, that the implications began to sink in.However it wasn't until I went out with my mum and her friend that I fully grasped them. I not only could see, I could see much better than I ever had. It literally was like seeing the world in HD for the first time. I saw a bunch of wild poppies on the canal bank and goggled at how red they were. In the garden centre, I covered my uncorrected left eye and goggled at all the plants, leaves and flowers - everything was so crisp and clear, it would make a grown man weep. Meanwhile, my left eye - which had the 'good' vision - now seems really poor: incredibly blurry and dim. But the right eye can compensate for that, at least long distance. I do have a slight complication: my right eye resembles something from a horror movie. It's red. I don't mean the pinkish-red of inflammation, I mean bright, bright red. Looking as though it's about to weep blood red. I hesitantly googled it and had the happy - and first - experience of google giving me a mundane and reassuring answer instead of an extremely rare and deadly disease. Confirmed it with a few more searches, but 99% sure now it's a subconjunctival haemorrhage. Sounds scary, but actually it's just a broken blood vessel in the white part of the eye and is completely harmless. But it does take 1-2 weeks to go away, so I have to go around looking like something out of Dracula until then. I've got to go to bed now. Sorry for the long ramble. I'll show you a photo of the wild poppies I took earlier to (hopefully) make it worth it. VIEW IMAGE",

This reply will be much, much, much shorter >_>.@Jamie - I was going to read 1984 next, but I think going straight from one dystopia to another dystopia might be a bit much, even for me. So I'm going to take a break with something lighter - will look on the Kindle store for a new book. (Before Animal Farm, I re-read all five books of the Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy \"trilogy\", which I enjoyed.)@Karen - Thanks. Hugs back :p @Trina - Wow, you don't have to be dying for somebody to come visit you in hospital. It's just the company which is nice. Seems like your mum never thought about that - I am sorry. My vision is still going strong. I'm putting in three different types of drops several times a day and have to wear an eye shield at night. To be honest, I'm so used to putting in eye drops it barely registers - I just bang in a drop or two whenever I remember. As far as I can tell, my right eye looks good (apart from the blood), and I don't think the uveitis has returned - although that's what the Maxidex is for. And now I must go and lie down in bed.

Getting blurry vision in my right eye, which is a bit disappointing :-( I'm not particularly worried, as it's not a new thing - had it long before the op. But my vision was so clear the day straight after the op and now it's gone back to how it was before. I think it's med related, so I will try stopping a couple of my meds soon to see if that is it.@Andrina - I deffo had anaesthesia! It was local, which is normal for cataract surgery. I was terrified beforehand, but I didn't feel a thing really, apart from minor discomfort at the beginning. You have found my brother's book?? I looked for both his name and title.... okay I'll have another look now. Found it this time. Weird :/ Bought it in case it disappears again. It's called Boris Goes To The Supermarket.

This is the mattress lifter I was looking at: https://www.healthandcare.co.uk/bed-cushions-supports/mattress-genie-adjustable-mattress-tilter.htmlIt's in the UK, but I'm sure you could find one in the US. I never had high blood sugar in the past, but that was a few years ago and things change. Also, I'm on a med (quetiapine) which can elevate blood sugar. Think it's time to buy a home testing kit and test my blood sugar levels. My brother was always into literature and writing.  Although he wasn't the sort to chase fame and success, I can't help feeling he must have been disappointed he didn't achieve more recognition. It's tough when you feel like you've failed. I'd quite like to try writing a story, but my problem at the moment is lack of ideas and inability to focus on anything. Anyway, I'm going to go to bed soon.

Maybe in a few years when the price has gone down and the technology has improved. But if I was going to spunk \u00a3500, I'd rather it was on a new mattress. I've also ordered some CBD oil! >_>. Genuinely looking forward to trying it out. I added some CBD honey and lemon lozenges to the order too. Literally the most expensive sweets I've ever bought. My excuse is that they'll calm me down in the car when I get road rage ;p (I rarely rage, but I do sometimes get really impatient, especially when I'm stuck behind a slow driver. Not particularly proud of that, but it's a hard habit to break...I also stopped my quetiapine: I couldn't stand the blurriness in my right eye anymore: I couldn't read a thing with it. The result is, I didn't get a single, solitary wink of sleep, I felt nauseous, my stomach was upset, but my vision is already a bit better. If I close my left eye, I can read the text on my laptop which I couldn't before. I'm determined to get off this toxic drug, but it is hard because of the chronic wakefulness: I didn't realise quite how sedating it was until I actually stopped it. I will try to fall asleep without it tonight, but if I fail I will cut a tablet in half and take that. I've got to take my car in for an MOT tomorrow, so I really can't go another entire night without a single minute of sleep. *sees time*. Okay, I'd better go to bed now in fact!

I guess the trick is to take it earlier in the evening so you will sleep at night.  I do meditation.  It most always works, but if it doesn't I take Xanax.  It makes me sleepy.  I would try the melatonin though, you can get it over the counter.  My husband takes 10mg.  Maybe it will work for you too.  It is a hormone that our bodies start lacking at the age of about 30.  I hope you can get on something that wont cause sleeplessness.  I am glad your eyes are better.  Knowing you got through the surgery gives me hope, mine will have to be done in the future.  My cataracts are small at this point.  That is what they told me anyway.  My poppies bloomed.  I went to take a pic and they are already fading.  So I didn't get a good pic.

I had a google anyway and found this, which was really interesting: https://www.mdedge.com/clinicalneurologynews/article/47354/pulmonology/melatonin-may-normalize-night-owl-sleep-schedulesI am 100% a night owl and in the last few months it's got worse. I will try the CBD oil first, but if that doesn't help then I will definitely give melatonin another try. I was taking it wrong in the past: way too late and probably at too high a dose. My car failed its MOT :-( Something to do with the headlights - no idea what. They did say, but I didn't really catch it. Have to go back next week and get them fixed. It's annoying, as my headlights seem fine to me. But I've been going to that garage for 10 years and they've never mugged me off before, so I believe them. The rules for passing an MOT get ever stricter, so what might have been okay a few years ago isn't necessarily okay now.Afterwards, I went and sat in a lovely churchyard to eat my lunch. Almost immediately a rather elegant and tanned old lady joined me. She. wouldn't. stop. talking. I wanted to eat my lunch, but couldn't because I don't like eating in front of people I don't know. She wanted to eat her lunch, but couldn't because of the fat pigeon which stood there for absolutely ages just waiting for food. At one point she got up and had a quick rummage in the bin next to the bench looking for food, but didn't find anything suitable. My braindead brain was like, 'w-t-f'. In retrospect, I think she must have been looking for something for the fat pigeon and not herself, which is what I first thought.  Watched another pigeon picking up twigs - it was obviously building a nest in a nearby tree - and the crows. One perched atop a tombstone a couple of times. Crows in a graveyard are so great. I also watch the birds in my parents' garden. Nothing as exotic as hummingbirds, but we do have a pair of ring-necked doves, which is nice. Oops. I left for this a couple of hours. I slept last night but I needed to take half a tablet of quetiapine to do so. I think I will start cutting all my tablets in half from now on and then into quarters. I will have to put up with the blurry vision a while longer, but hopefully it won't be as bad with a lower dose. Thank you, Karen, for listening to my burbling <_<. I hope you had a good day today.",

I am just not sure, I hate to alter her personality, but I wish she would calm down some.I understand why you want to wait to get a dog.  July is here so you will have your second operation soon I imagine.  I bet you will be glad when it is over.Take care Miranda...Hugs, Karen...",

Funnily enough my appointment this morning was with the ophthalmologist, who said my eyes were fine. But as I was driving home tonight I couldn't help but notice how redder all the lights looked. It was subtle, but I couldn't shake off the feeling. Thought it might be atmospheric disturbance. But when I got home, I noticed immediately the red tint was still there and that it was in my right eye but not the left one. I've never seen this before.Did some googling and that, plus the blurriness when reading, matches cystoid macular edema. If the redness hasn't gone by tomorrow I'm phoning up eye casualty. It never ends. I've got my CBD oil but less excited about it now :-( As for your dog, she might just need more exercise. Some breeds are bottomless wells of energy, which can be difficult to manage. I'm gonna go to bed now. Feeling very, very deflated after a long, stressful day. Goodnight Karen. Take care.",

Accidentally pressed one of them, which must have been the back key, and lost my post. Urgh. Okay, long story short, phoned up eye casualty. Receptionist recommended I see an optician so I went and made an appointment with a local one for tomorrow. The red tint has gone now anyway. Suspect my right eye may have got sunburnt. ((Yes, it's a thing.) I noticed yesterday that my right arm was browner than my left arm, and that can only have come from driving - it's the only way my right arm could have got more sun exposure than the left. I'm on meds which can increase photosensitivity, e.g. 6MP and I've noticed for the last few years I do tan much quicker than I used to.Anyway, I'm just relieved that I (probably) don't have cystoid macular edema after all. Re your dog. It does sound like she needs more exercise tbh. Is there anywhere you can let her run off the leash for a while, e.g. a field or park. And, yes, an evening walk would be good for her. Some dog breeds are naturally chill, e.g. bull mastiffs. I used to know one, and she was the most placid dog ever: I don't think an active volcano would have stirred that thing. Our old dog, a Jack Russell terrier, had boundless energy when he was young - he would chase a football for hours and not get tired of it. He did calm down and need less exercise as he got older. Okay, I'm gonna go and get my dinner now. I got a Waygu steak, much reduced :p Never had one before, so looking forward to giving it a go.Post Edited (NiceCupOfTea) : 7/2/2019 12:42:03 PM (GMT-6)",

He thought the red tint might have been caused by a small bleed in the back of the eye, but there was no sign of that on the scan. Anyway, whatever it was, it's gone now. I can finally relax until the next panic <_<. I didn't order any new glasses as there's no point until I've had the left eye done and both eyes have settled completely from surgery. I'm knackered, as I was awake for hours last night with nausea and diarrhoea. Something really upset my stomach. My dinner I presume, although steak and chips doesn't usually upset my stomach to that degree. It isn't any too great tonight, but never mind :-/ My friend has got a new dog! A 4-year-old greyhound from a rescue place. She seems happy with him and he looks nice from the pictures. I thought she and her husband might get a guide dog first, given that the previous guide dog sadly and unexpectedly died of an inoperable tumour a few weeks ago. It's interesting how only a very few breeds are suitable for being a guide dog - a greyhound isn't one of those breeds apparently.Anyhow, another day, another bedtime. Gonna lie down and read.

Took one look at the instructions and thought \"later.\" That was 2 weeks ago :-( No, I've not read my brother's book yet. Truth to tell, I'm not looking forward to reading it - I can't help feeling it'll be very depressing, with no humour to lighten the darkness. That said, I will read it once I've finished my current book, 'Children Of Time.' It's really good so far. Much, much, much more readable than 'Aurora', which was also about space travel and humans searching for a new planet to live on. But it's long and I'm not the world's fastest reader, because internet and videogames.Anyway, my brother has come down for a week. Today we went to my oldest brother's place for a BBQ. I wasn't looking forward to going, but I had a nicer time than expected: I even managed to stay off my phone for most of it. Saw my nephews for the first time in ages. They are growing up so fast: I still have a mental image of them being about 5 years younger than they really are, because I used to see them far more when they were younger. But they're good lads. The oldest, especially, has really come out of his shell and is not in the least bit sullen or reserved (unlike me at that age). Andrina - I'm still getting all the certificates! Ordered my grandfather's wedding certificate a few weeks ago, which really should have arrived by now and hasn't. I need that and his death certificate still, plus signed and witnessed copies of my documents and my mother's documents, e.g. passports. That part is going to be a bit of a nightmare, as I need to find a professional who knows me - well, how many professionals do I know? But I can probably get my GP or dentist to do it for a fee. I'm doing okay, thanks. I daresay it won't last forever, but I'm out of the immediate woods of depression. Getting the cataract surgery helped. The uveitis is under control. Hopefully my eyes will continue to be okay and not deteriorate. I'm also starting Stelara on the 15th June, so I hope that will help with the Crohn's side of things. Will go to bed soon. Just having a rare Jack Daniels and Coke first <_<.",

In the meantime I'm gonna try and get all the relevant documents signed and witnessed. I need a professional person who personally knows me, who also has a stamp or a business card - yeah, I know so many of those. Thinking of making an appointment with my bank manager, who I wouldn't know if I fell over them in the bank, but hopefully the DFA won't know that. At any rate, I would hope a bank manager has a business card, if nothing else. And this is just to become an Irish citizen. I've still got to get the passport after that :/ It's going to take at least a year, but the good news is Brexit won't affect it.Still determined to get off the quetiapine. I can barely read at times, it's so blurry. It wasn't quite as bad before the cataract operation, but now I've lost the ability to see close up with my right eye and I'm heavily dependent on my left eye to see anything close up at all - it's easier to read if I use an eye patch. I will take half a dose tonight, then a quarter of the dose the next night. Luckily quetiapine clears the system rapidly, so if it is that, I should hopefully see an improvement in a day or two. Going to get a shower now. Not quite bedtime yet, but will go for an earlier than usual night, as I have a long day ahead tomorrow. Going to St Albans with my mum and brother. Goodnight Karen :p",

                "comment": "Hi folks.@Karen - I enjoyed the trip to St Albans and would definitely like to go back there. There's an amazing cathedral which is literally a mish mash of architectural styles through the ages. You get a small taster of what churches must have once looked like, before everything was destroyed, painted over, or replaced. Been a bit of a struggle since. I stopped the quetiapine for a couple of nights. The first night I got literally no sleep. The second night I got 2-3 hours. The third night (which was last night), I took half a tablet because I needed to be at the hospital at 11am for my first Stelara infusion. Even though I did get a full night's sleep I was so tired I could barely function. When I found out that a problem had occurred and the Stelara wouldn't be arriving until 4pm, I almost felt like crying :-/ I didn't want to do the whole drive home and back again, but the time passed by quite quickly without me doing a lot: I was so tired, I spent a long time sitting in my car. I managed to doze a little bit and that helped a lot: I felt almost human again. Another reason why I want to stop the quetiapine is that I think it contributes a *lot* to this type of grogginess. It's not as noticeable when I don't have to get up for anything, but it still takes me hours just to get out of bed and get dressed. For a long time I put it down to depression and lack of motivation, but I think quetiapine-induced sedation may be causing it as well. My sleeping pattern was also getting more and more out of whack and I want to try and bring it within whack. It's horrible being a braindead zombie all day until literally about 11pm and then feeling lively and fully awake. I do like the night time - always have done. But on a practical level, I still need to do stuff during the day sometimes, e.g. attend appointments. When you're struggling to cope with even afternoon appointments, you know you've got a problem.I've decided to try low dose melatonin for Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. I don't have an official diagnosis, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this is what's causing my inability to fall asleep until 4 or 5am, even with quetiapine. Unfortunately the recommended dose for treating DSPS is very low and I can't even get it in the UK, so I had to order it from the US. Bit annoyed by that, as that will increase the delivery time to about 3 weeks. So yeah, it's all a bit of a struggle at the moment. Sleep deprivation really does make it harder to regulate your negative emotions and I need that about as much as I need a hole in the head. (Also, quetiapine withdrawal symptoms may be having an effect too.) I just realised I forgot to tie up the Stelara business >_>. I did get my Stelara eventually at 5:30pm. The loading dose is an hour long infusion and the Stelara was due to expire at 7pm, so I really did just get it in the nick of time. No side effects. Thankfully it works quicker than Entyvio, so hopefully I will notice a difference within a few weeks. I'm getting so tired of diarrhoea, urgency, and chronic low-grade abdominal pain (with occasional severe pain) - amongst other things, I am sure it affects the quality of my sleep. So I hope it does help.@nssg - Today :p I share your frustration at life passing by. I feel like I've wasted my life and that it's too late to train for an interesting career, and that I'm doing nothing at all. I wish I could help, because it's crappy feeling that way. Do you have anything you enjoy doing? Me, I've got a book I'm reading which I'm really enjoying - it's been the best thing I've read in years. It's been so nice to find something I actually like. For a long time I was doing stuff to pass the time, but not really getting any pleasure or enjoyment from it. (There is a technical term for that: anhedonia.)Okay, I'd better update my sig and then go. Goodnight guys <_<.",

I enjoy cooking but I don't think I'd like to do it as a job. I don't feel like I'd like doing anything for money. Once it comes down to hours = money, I get really down. I wish I could live without money at the forefront of everything I do. I realize it is the same story for everyone so I try not to let it get to me. It just brings me down that I spend the majority of my time trying to make a dollar. This is how it's been for as long as I remember and probably how it will be until I keel over somewhere. I don't see the point in all of it. Everyone is so worried about child-rearing and I am just worried about the point of it all. It seems so pointless to force someone into this life of spending every moment focused on doing a job for a dollar. I am also exhausted all the time and I don't sleep well. If I didn't have to work, who knows what type of schedule I would keep... Have you tried exercise? If I do something physical it does help me to sleep better, it can also help with energy, but it's so difficult to motivate when your energy level is as low as mine.

                "comment": "Guys, I think last night has to be an early contender for \"Worst Night's Sleep Of The Year\" award. I was bone, bone tired, and hoped this would be sufficient to make me nod off. It wasn't. I had a song stuck in my head for hours that I couldn't get rid of. The strange thing is that it stuck at all, since while that used to happen to me when I was younger, it rarely does now. Finally after about 3 hours I sank into a dream-filled doze for a few minutes, then woke up. The dreams were creepy as hell. (I only remember a couple of images from them now.) Same thing happened again later on in the night - nodding off straight into bad dreams, only to promptly wake up again.I gave up on sleep for that night, but actually I did get a bit of sleep mid-morning. Maybe an hour or so, not really sure. I didn't want to sleep for too long anyway, because I'm trying to retrain my body clock to fall asleep by 2am, not 9am! Meanwhile, I decided to order more melatonin, 1mg pills this time. (As long as they're not timed/sustained release, I should be able to cut them in half without issue.) Melatonin is technically only available only on prescription in the UK, hence why no UK sites stock it. You can still order it from abroad though - the trick to not waiting 3 weeks is to try to order it from Germany rather than the US. Plus I paid extra for express delivery, so it should be here in a couple of days.@Karen - Thanks! Not to continuously bang on about melatonin (at least it's helping you guys fall asleep, right? <_<), but I decided on a low dose for a few reasons: 1) To avoid grogginess the next day, which is more likely with higher doses;  2) Studies have shown low doses of 0.3-1mg are just as effective. The body only produces a small amount of melatonin and even 3mg is literally 10x more than the highest natural amount produced. 3) Too high a dose can desensitize the melatonin receptors and make melatonin stop working. That's less likely to happen with a low dose.You can tell I've been doing too much late night reading >.> But that said, going by the online comments I've seen, people seem to take all sorts of doses - I saw one lady who was on 60mg. Some people did say that they felt better when they reduced their dose, but others seemed happy with their 3mg, 10mg, or whatever. I think the older you get, the harder it becomes to be a \"go-getter\", especially if you are not temperamentally that way inclined. I think if I could go back in time with the knowledge I had now, I could do so much more - or maybe I'm just kidding myself, I don't know. As for the future, it's a dark, rather terrifying, blank :-/ @nssg - The book is \"Children of Time.\" After banging on about melatonin for ages, my mind has gone a bit blank now, so just look up a description on Amazon. It's my kinda themes though: space exploration, colonization, genetically engineered spiders, etc. It's actually much better written than that may make it sound, and the story is a cracker so far: unusually it just keeps on getting better and better. I'm only halfway though, so take my judgement with a pinch of salt. I don't think most people love working, really. But most people seem able to bear it considerably better than I could. (In retrospect I didn't know I had autism/ADD, but even if I had known, not sure how much difference it would have made, especially without support.) My oldest brother never likes his jobs either, but the mere fact of working doesn't seem to make him depressed. It did my dad though. Oh, boy did it my dad and didn't we all know about it (but to be fair to him, he also had undiagnosed high functioning autism. My brother on the other hand shows no signs of autism whatsoever).My brother's wife, on the other hand, loves working and would be bored out of her mind without it. Even the retail stuff (it used to be just retail, but now she does teaching as well). I can't really fathom that. I hate shops. I hate people. I hate standing up all day long and nowadays would be almost physically unbearable. Retail work would be my own personal hell, although I respect the people who do it, since I can't. I'm not sure what my point is, really. Other than people's attitudes to work, and ability to bear it, seems to vary so widely. It's sad when work takes up so much of your time and energy, you have nothing left over with which to enjoy the rest of life. Very sad. Exercise helps me to feel better sometimes, but seems to have no effect on falling asleep -  I can be physically shattered and mentally wide awake. Incidentally, sleep has a massive influence on our well-being. Trouble is, modern life makes it so hard to sleep well. I'm off to the town centre now before the shops close. It will give me a walk and a bit of fresh air, but I also need to get dinner and a couple of other things. See you later, folks.",

Actually, I used to really sort of love my job, but that was before I realized what a load of crap it is. I don't hate my job, and I love the people, I am very lucky in that respect. I just hate spending all my time worrying about work and money. It's such a chore... Back to the topic of loving work, all the people I know who say they love work really don't. One of the people I know who was most adamant about loving work recently retired and now she's totally uninterested in doing any type of work. Before retirement she was always talking about all the jobs she would take in retirement, she even went so far as to say she wasn't looking forward to retirement. Crazy how her tune has changed... I know a couple of other people who claim to love their jobs. I get it, it keeps you busy, it's something to do, for that, it's great. It's only great if you feel like you're doing something worthwhile though, and after a certain point in most positions, you will realize you're completely replaceable. Not just that, you might feel like what you're doing is pointless and unfulfilling. Corporate jobs are not fun. 90% of the time you're spinning your wheels working on something to appease someone you have zero respect for, who got their position because they know someone, and worse, the task is useless and completely unnecessary. Sometimes I wish I worked in retail. I hate being on my feet like that too though, it's exhausting, plus it doesn't pay as much as the corporate job. If I am going to sell my time for money, I might as well make as much as I can.",

                "comment": "Hi you two...Some people make their job their whole life.  I liked working for the most part, but I couldn't put my job top priority.  But I did the best I could no matter what type of job it was.  I think my favorite job was working in a bakery.  I would get up about 3:30 am and be to work at 5:00.  I got out about 1:00 or 2:00 so I had a lot of the day left for other things, though I would have to go to bed early to be able to function the next day.  But I liked filling donuts and stuff.  Plus people ordering donuts were usually in good moods. . Though I did have one cranky lady that I eventually won over.  That was a huge accomplishment for me.I don't like people in general either.  There are so many bad people in the world.  Greedy, self centered, manipulative.  Catty women.  Men stuck on themselves.  Not all people are that way, but enough to make me not like them.  I like the people here, they are real.  Humble...I been using meditation to sleep Miranda.  It hasn't been working lately.  The insurance company wont pay for the dose of medication that helps me.  So my medication was cut by 50 mg.  I think I can get another medication added to help me but I am not sure, but anyway, I am having trouble with mindfulness and meditation right now.  I am thinking far too much.  But I see my psychologist next month and will discuss it then unless I get bad, then I will call her.  But otherwise the meditation helps me a lot.  Hubby takes the melatonin.  But the 1 and 3 mg wasn't enough so he takes 10.  That helps but I think his sleep could be better.  There is something always effecting it and lately it has been aches and pains.  Plus muscle spasms.I hope you two have a good day.  NSSG, I know what you mean about working.  I wish it could be more gratifying.  I think when somebody does something that they love it can be.  But for the most part we just work a job for money to live on and can't always do something we love.  Living off the grid would be awesome but it is terrible hard work to do so.Take care both of you...Hugs, Karen...",

                "comment": "Thanks Trina! :p (High Five/Hug back to you and the other guys on this board too.)Well I went for my walk. Didn't go far, only into the town centre and then to Waitrose caf\u00e9 for a coffee. Afterwards I sat on a bench by the canal. It was early evening and perfect summer weather: sunny without being too hot (anything above 25 degrees Celsius can seriously jog on). I had bought a packet of 4 rolls and fed one of them slowly to the ducks and pigeons. Once I had finished the roll, a pigeon on the bench stared hopefully at me, then hopped off once it realised it wasn't getting anything else. Not sure if this was the same pigeon or not, but what happened next was hilarious. A pigeon started pecking at my ankle, including the top of my shoe, the bare bit of skin above the shoe and the bottom of my jeans. I bent down to take a look and the pigeon moved away. I went back to my phone. A few seconds later, my ankle was being pecked again. I took another look. The pigeon went away again. I went back to my phone. The pigeon came back again. By this time I was trying not to laugh and let the pigeon do its thing. After a couple of minutes it finally left of its own accord - I'm still not sure if it was trying to eat my ankle or looking for bread.While I was there a heron came over and I got a nice picture of it. @nssg - It's not ridiculously hot, but I have been too hot the last few nights. I don't like open windows: I get the noise of the traffic, people passing outside, etc. I'm also in a ground floor flat, so open windows - even on the latch - don't feel terribly safe. That said, think I'll go and open my bedroom window now for a couple of hours before bedtime: it's feeling a bit stuffy in here. I hope you enjoy the book if ever you get around to reading it. Don't worry if you don't: I won't be checking up on you <_<. I don't think my sister in law is lying about loving work. I mean, \"love\" may be a bit of a strong word in this context, but I think she is happy to go to work. My brother has always said if he could afford not to work, he wouldn't, on the other hand. Frankly, unless the job itself is intrinsically interesting or satisfying, I cannot imagine why anyone would rather be in an office or shop instead of being at home. Yes, I am sometimes bored at home, but that is still nothing compared to the infinite boredom of being stuck in an office with work so repetitive, a trained monkey could do it. Not to mention, I rarely liked office environments; often the commute was horrendous too. Even in my 20s I found a 5-day week, with 9-10 hours a day given to commuting and working, shatteringly exhausting. There were some jobs that were more bearable than others. The one I liked best was a 20-minute walk away - no getting buses and tube trains into London. The work there was a bit more interesting and varied than most, too. Sadly it was only a temporary position and it came to an end after 3 months.@Karen - Those hours at the bakery would have killed me - I've always been a night owl. But that actually doesn't sound too bad, plus you presumably got to sample the goods :p When I was 16 to 19 years old, I did a part time job at McDonald's and actually didn't mind it (full time might have been a different story though). Later on, my friend joined and we had some good times there. I hate stories of insurance companies overriding doctors and refusing to prescribe meds or increase the dose :/ It's just wrong, but that's a whole other can of worms which I'm far too tired to open tonight. Suffice to say, I know there are some US people on the UC board who get mesalazine drugs from Canada because they're much cheaper there (even with insurance). I'm not sure whether your med would be available in Canada, but maybe it's worth a look? I hope the trouble with the meditation and mindfulness is a temporary blip. I must admit, it's something I have always struggled with. Maybe 'cos my concentration is so scattered most of the time. I would love to live off the grid, but that takes skillz I don't have. If you could manage to generate your own electricity, grow your own food, etc. you'd be so set up for the zombie apocalypse.  It's nearly midnight, so I'm gonna get a shower and start winding down slowly for bed. Goodnight guys - take care.",

It wasn't my favorite job.  I only worked there for a short time.  I ended up going to the bakery after that.  And they encouraged you to taste so you could tell the customers what things were like.   And I was skinny and ate everything.  Ha...I have thought about checking Canada for my medication.  I am going to talk to my psychologist about it when I go next month.  Plus see if I can add something if not.  But I don't know if my insurance company would even cover another cheaper medication.  I got one of the worst.  And that isn't exaggerating. I get my late husband's retirement so I get a state insurance.  They change the prescription insurance every couple of years.  I think that this is the cheapest one that they could find or something.  This one I think is going on three years.  So I think that they chose them twice.  I had a different insurance before that was real good.  I filled out a questionnaire survey type thing that was anonymous and gave them a bad report.  I am sure a lot of people did.  They deserved it.You probably wont be reading this until you get up tomorrow, so I will say have a good day...  Take care Miranda...Hugs, Karen...",

Stomach wasn't good either. Dozed off briefly this morning, but it was full of weird and creepy dreams again. Getting off this quetiapine is murder, at least sleep-wise. So far, have been surprisingly functional otherwise, but at some point I will need a full night's sleep. I'm in a bit of a zombie state at the moment.Speaking of zombies, Karen, you would definitely need a good arms cache! That's the one thing that's impossible to obtain in the UK, of course. At least legally (and rightfully so, to be fair. But come the zombie apocalypse, the army and criminals are gonna be the only ones able to defend themselves).@Karen - So if you find an insurance you like, you're not allowed to stay with it? That's outrageous. Especially as they don't seem to just roll over your prescriptions from one insurance to the next, so if the prescription gets changed or removed, tough luck for the patient. Do doctors have any say over this whatsoever or is the final decision always the insurance company's? Anyway, I hope your psychologist can help next month. And do look into getting meds cheaper from Canada. @Buena - That book sounds quite interesting: I'll look it up on Amazon. As for your feelings, they are common in \"helping\" professions! People get burnt out eventually - \"compassion fatigue\" is a real thing. It doesn't mean the people who do such jobs don't care, but chances are they've been overworked and in many cases underpaid for what they do. Plus they may have become traumatized themselves if they've been regularly exposed to traumatizing situations. It's easier to be \"noble\" with the right support, which very often nurses, etc. don't get. People aren't machines and eventually even the most committed worker will break down without the proper care.Just had lunch and gonna go to my gardening place. Not been enjoying it much lately. Doesn't help that there's a staff member there who is starting to wear on my nerves. She means well, I know, but she is a bit too overenthusiastic and, honestly, I could do without it.

Can you get some headphones so you can enjoy music while you are there?  Maybe she wouldn't approach you so much if she saw you were listening to music???  I don't know, just a suggestion.  Talking to her might help to if you can say nicely that it is bothering you.  Though that could be hard to do as the other person would probably end up feeling insulted.

She's not the only staff member to have looked for me and asked if I'm all right, but she does it way more than anyone else. And, yes, she's always trying to talk to me. I think her intentions are good, but she just goes overboard with the attention and I find it a bit much, especially when I'm down and not feeling up to socialising with the group. I think she is trying to give me more space now, but yeah, it can lead to awkwardness at times. I have a feeling headphones wouldn't make much difference. Staring at a phone doesn't :-/ A few people were moaning today that it was too hot. By American standards it is absolutely pathetic - it was 23C (that's 73F) and 46% humidity when I checked my phone. Meanwhile, I read a Reddit thread where Americans were talking about which state was the most hot, humid, sweaty hellhole. Florida won, I think. Anyway, I was seeing temperatures of 90-110F and humidity of 80-90% bandied around. Yikes! The moment I stepped into a Florida summer, I think I would melt into a literal puddle of sweat, leaving only my clothes behind. I felt comfortable with the weather today personally, but anything above 23/24C can jog on. It's predicted to go up to 28C (82F) next week and I'm not looking forward to that.

I took 1mg of melatonin at midnight (it would have been a few hours earlier if I wanted to try to correct my delayed sleep phase disorder, but I thought for now it was more important to just sleep rather than worry about that). I then took a shower, made a cup of ginseng and chamomile tea, took it to bed and started reading. The moment I felt myself nodding off I turned off the light rather than try to finish the chapter. Slept straight through from 1:30am to 8:30am, then, slightly surprisingly, another hour after that - wasn't expecting to fall back to sleep. So, the melatonin worked! And maybe the tea helped too. (I got a good quality brand and let it stew for 10 minutes - takes a while for the herbs to infuse.) I feel lucky more than anything, given most of those stories I was reading on the Seroquel withdrawal thread. There were nearly 900 replies and nearly everyone had gone through hell or was going through hell. How can psychiatrists prescribe powerful and addictive (addictive in the sense of causing physical dependency) medication so cavalierly and irresponsibly? Many people were on a cocktail of equally potent and addictive meds. And it is absolutely not necessary in most cases, as Finland found out via its open Dialogue programme. By the way, I was out with my mum yesterday and we saw a notice in a pharmacist's asking the public to please not to blame them for the NHS medicine shortages. We asked the pharmacist about it, but she was incredibly tight-lipped and wouldn't say anything. We asked her if she was worried, and she said there was nothing they could do - an odd reply, but I suppose she is already learning to get in her defensive repudiations of responsibility. (We weren't blaming her and I don't think our question even implied we were.)But that's what Brexit basically is: a collective repudiation of responsibility, beginning with the top echelons of government and working its way downwards.Okay, I'm gonna get some lunch.

I actually took it on the basis of this post: Anyhow, I discovered a couple years ago that my cortisol levels were too high at night and that was keeping me in a very alert state causing the insomnia. I started looking into herbs that lower cortisol.I started drinking Korean Ginseng Tea which I get at Superstore, 2 bags per day and felt weirdly sleepy and yawning at night which was completely foreign to me. I was able to gradually get off all sleeping pills and sleep naturally. What a gift!!!I understood exactly what she meant by lack of sleepiness and yawning. I could be running on fumes and I still wouldn't feel sleepy tired. That said, I couldn't actually find Korean Ginseng tea in my supermarket - not even Waitrose - so I got the nearest thing I could find. Maybe today I'll pop into Holland & Barrett and see if I can find it there.PS: I'm also not as weirdly starving as I was. I'm eating more slowly and not bolting things down like a ravenous wildebeest who hasn't eaten for 3 days.

It took up to a year for my skin to recover after oxycodone :-/ But that was *much* worse, so hopefully it won't take nearly as long this time. Anyway, my grandfather's death certificate arrived today, so I've got all the certificates I need now. Just need various copies of documents signed before I can send off my application. Have decided to pay a notary to do it. I want to get this into the system ASAP, as there's already a horribly long waiting time - anything up to 12 months apparently.@Karen - No you weren't wrong about ginseng. I've only looked into it briefly so far and it's pretty complicated. Ginseng is an 'adaptogen', part of a group of herbs which modulate the body's stress response. And the body's stress response - the HPA axis - is insanely complicated. Ginseng seems able to both lower and raise cortisol (not at the same time, obvs). In general, it has both a stress-reducing effect and a fatigue-reducing one. But yeah. I'm a bit less keen on it now after finding this: https://traditionalroots.org/files/2015/05/bergner-dark-side-adaptogens.pdf I'm thinking of trying Indian ginseng, ashwartahganthta something (I can't spell it, can you tell?), instead. Seems to be less stimulating than panax ginseng. As for the people on the anxiety board waking up with high anxiety, cortisol is at its highest in the mornings and gradually decreases during the day, so maybe that's why. I've personally never noticed that though: I'm anxious day and night. @HT - Very poetic :p",

I don't get morning anxiety like some do.  Does adrenalin have anything to do with cortisol?  I get bad anxiety when I have to leave to do something.  Leaving the house gets difficult for me.  But so far I have managed to do it.  And I do feel better once I get going.  It is just that period before leaving.I am sorry you didn't sleep well last night but don't give up.  You slept the night before and I feel you will sleep again.  I hate restless leg syndrome.  I had it before when I first got fibromyalgia.  I think my body was use to moving and the fibro kept me from doing so.  I just wanted to run as hard as I could but it was night time and there was no where to go.  Boy do I ever hate that feeling so I do feel for you.  I am sure you will get more sleep.  Maybe your body is adjusting to the melatonin.  It probably doesn't want to give up easily.I am glad you are getting your records together.  I am no good at stuff like that.  I get really frustrated when I think I have come to a dead end or when I have to gather information.  I just had to get some proofs together myself.  I did it, but didn't like doing it.  Luckily I have a printer so that helps.  Making copies and such.I hope you have a lovely day Miranda.  I hope you get some sleep tonight, you are probably needing a nap.  I don't like taking them but they help.  As long as I only sleep about 45 minutes.  I guess after that your body tries to get the deeper sleep and a lot of people feel worse instead of better when they sleep longer than that.Take care and thanks for posting.Hugs, Karen...",

                "comment": "Hi Karen.From what I understand, adrenalin is the 'fight or flight' hormone while cortisol is slower acting - it takes longer to rise and longer to fall back down. This is quite a good post which explains it (although it does leave out a third stress hormone, norepinephrine). https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/demystifying_depression/the_stress_systemI have a similar problem with anxiety before leaving the house or doing anything really. I've got a psychological assessment tomorrow and have been dreading that :-( It's for something I've been on the waiting list for a long time: group therapy. Only I think you have to do 1 or 2 preliminary courses before you even start the group therapy - it's taken me nearly a year to get this far. Anyway, despite not looking forward to it I'd be mad to miss it after waiting this long.I slept a bit better last night, but it was very disturbed - lots of awakenings. Anyhow, I'd better go to bed now. Sorry to rush this post, but I had to hang a load of washing up, get a shower, etc. and now it's 10 minutes before my planned bedtime :-/ PS: I can't nap. Can't remember the last time I was able to fall asleep during the day. I really do find it hard to fall asleep. Anyway goodnight :p",

So if my itching or crappy stomach doesn't keep me awake, the heat will. Awesome. @Karen - I'm glad the link helped. I went to my assessment. It was a bit different to what I expected - no notes, no questionnaires, just pure talking about me and my life, past and present, for over an hour. Yes, that was as depressing as it sounded. We couldn't get everything done in one session, so I'll be going back again soon. From what he said, it seemed like he wanted to discuss the different options for therapy with me. But I don't know what they are yet.Anyway, I quite liked him and would be happy to continue with him, I think. As for group therapy, I hope it's more efficient than the other mental health groups I've attended. It drives me mad how much time some of these groups waste faffing around: reading aloud the same group rules every meeting; taking forever to hand stuff out; taking forever to go through a worksheet with basic facts about anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, etc. that I've already read a million times before in newspaper articles or online. (I know not everyone may have, but still...) And at the the day hospital we literally spent more time sitting around waiting for the teachers to arrive than we did with the teachers. I am not exaggerating. A supposed 9:15am start often turned into a 10:15am one. What a dump that place was - sorry, I've gone off on another tangent, I'll come back now <_<. @Andrina - Thank you. I was too drained to do it today, but tomorrow I'm going to try printing off the application form (which I also need to get signed) and making an appointment with a notary. Then as soon as that's out of the way, it's new mattress time - my current mattress is old and getting saggy. Also still gonna get an inflatable mattress lifter or, maybe, an adjustable bedframe. The latter is a lot more expensive and I'm not convinced  it's worth it when the \u00a3120 inflatable thingy seems to do its job pretty well. My mum's friend cast doubts over it and asked what if I punctured it? I said I'm not gonna be stabbing it with scissors. Seemed a bit of a dumb objection to me.",

In theory, surgery \"cures\" their IBD and so they shouldn't be at any more risk from GI side effects than the general population. In practice, I don't know if that's true or not. For me I've got Crohn's and I probably shouldn't take ibuprofen, but I do. I take it as infrequently as I can, but for some things, paracetamol just doesn't work as well. And in my case, I don't think the occasional ibuprofen makes any difference - if it does, it's impossible to tell. @Karen - Was better today thankfully. Went to my gardening place, only to find out it was shut - they had called/texted me, but I use my phone for almost everything except actually checking/answering messages. I thought the reason why they were closed was really stupid - it was too hot. It was 28C. Yeah, 40C might be dangerous, but 28C? So ridiculous. It's hardly like we're doing strenuous back-breaking work. Last summer all I did was water the plants. Apparently there's a change of people at the top and they've got new insurance. So now not only does our gardening site shut every time there's 2 flakes of snow on the ground, it will also shut every time the thermometer goes above 26-7C. The woman there today claimed it's for our safety, but in reality they just don't want to get sued if somebody does collapse in a freak accident on a hot day - I guarantee it. Anyway, I had nothing else to do, so I got in the car and drove to Wendover. Laid down on the grass and read for a while. It would've been even better if annoying kids weren't playing in the stream at the bottom, but I didn't have the energy to get up and move. Aside from that, I did feel better today. Until I found out about Boris Johnson's new cabinet - the Cabinet of Evil\u2122. As for Johnson, think I'm just gonna call him Trump 2 from now on. Trump 1 and Trump 2. Cute. Time for me to go to bed. I've left it a bit late tonight. So hot though (it's gonna be much hotter tomorrow apparently), and my stomach is hurting. Can't see this being one of the best night's sleep ever, but I have to at least try. Goodnight :p",

We don't have A/C and houses are designed to keep heat, not lose it. So while it was slightly cooler out in the sticks, where my parents are, by yesterday evening my mum's bedroom was only slightly cooler than the surface of Venus. Every upstairs window was open, but there was no breeze to lift the relentless heat and stuffiness. Luckily the temperature dropped by several degrees today. Still too warm, though. Should really open a window, but I live in a ground floor flat and do not feel comfortable with leaving the window open all night.I've got in touch with a local notary about signing my documents. I suspect it'll cost a bit, but at this point I don't care - I'm getting so bored of this now! @Karen - I've got a sick feeling of dread and disgust to my stomach. This is a coup. We've turned into a banana republic, only without the bananas and we've got a monarchy. I feel so horribly powerless. A pro-Boris/pro no deal disinformation campaign has already begun on Facebook, probably in readiness for a general election this autumn. At least you guys have a real opposition. We don't even have that. The opposition parties range from useless to appalling. We are living in the worst possible timeframe. Somewhere in a parallel universe, there is a formidable remain alliance dedicated to preventing the alt right takeover of the UK and destruction of its economy. In this timeframe, the opposition might as well all give up their jobs and go home, because all they can do is squabble and grandstand amongst themselves. Plus the Labour leadership is pro-Brexit, pro-1970s style socialism, anti-reality. I'm a lifelong Labour voter who won't vote Labour anymore, because it's been hijacked by the clueless, witless hardliners. Apologies for the rant - I'll shut up now.@Trina - I'm sorry you had to give up work. It sounds like you were good at your job and enjoyed it. It must have been difficult to accept. By the way, thanks for the app recommendation - I'll look it up in the Google playstore. Sorry to rush, folks, but my stomach is hurting quite a bit and I want to lie down.

I've done 90mph on the motorway in my rust bucket a few times (at 100mph it would probably judder apart). Reckless driving can be a sign of depression, in the sense that if the person stops caring about what happens to them, they are more likely to indulge in risky behaviour. If they are numb, it may make them feel something briefly. If they have low self esteem, they may even feel like they deserve to get hurt. However, if the reckless driving was an isolated incident and not part of a wider pattern, then your son probably just liked fast driving. Many people do :/ I'm so sorry you and your husband aren't talking. It sounds like both of you are dealing with your son's loss in different ways. It's really, really hard when one person wants to talk about it, and the other person doesn't. We were at a family BBQ recently. The subject of my deceased brother came up. My mum started to get visibly upset and my older brother was obviously uncomfortable. My mum quickly changed the subject, but honestly, I just thought what an ***hole my older brother was at that moment. He didn't actually say anything, but he didn't have to.My mum doesn't bring up my brother a lot to me anymore, but when she does I let her talk about it. To be honest, after nearly 2 years I guess there isn't much left to say. But the feelings are still there, they haven't gone away.Anyway, I agree with the others - you do have grit! And it will get better. Not okay, or as it used to be, but better than it is now. And maybe in time you and your husband can learn to communicate with each other again - I hope so. Take care, weary.

I had a lot of anger and did a lot of acting out in my late 20's, once I got away from my family and was firmly on my own.  For me, that culminated in getting involved with a boyfriend who was a drug dealer and an addict, and at one point I did shoot up drugs.  Kind of hard for me to believe now.Just my opinion, when people act out they usually just need some help.  Communication is so important.  I have many times gotten great relief just from telling someone what's going on.For some reason, in our society, fast speed in cars is glorified, especially for teen boys.I wish you good luck and healing!Love, Rich aka Older Guy",

(Buena76)Pitmom, I think your neighbors should be thanking you for getting things done for the community rather than criticizing you. Some people! I hope you don't isolate yourself - I have a tendency to do that too and it always makes me feel worse. Maybe you could find a new \"community\", like volunteering at the animal shelter (they don't talk too much) or reading to preschoolers (they do, but they are pretty non-judgmental). It has been raining here, as well as everywhere else, it seems. The clouds are clearing a bit and I can see snow on the mountain top, down to about the 9,000 foot level. (I am at 8,500 feet). I hope it doesn't snow down here overnight . My younger son is flying back to Seattle tonight and my older son is up here for a day or two because he had a job interview in Denver today. It's great to have them around and I am gong to be lonely when they are gone.

Mother in law told me day before Mothers day that John was holding me in \"reserve\"!  I did go over on Mothers day.  I have not seen her since.I just can't grasp that in my entire life, I have been betrayed by everyone I have loved. Try and find one person that didn't, there is no one.  It over whelms me. I am scared for the future. I can not call or talk to anyone about my thoughts be cause of the attempt 2/2018. I will be sent crisis automatically.  John will have me committed.  I will have no choice this time. So I have to tough it out alone. I use my skills and I bounce back.  Still the darkness lingers.   Sun 6/9 I plan on attending an Art 'Meet up' 3pm to 5pm.  just to get out of the house.  But I can not say I am looking forward to it.  Tomorrow is prayer group, said I was going, 6:15p,  but I most like won't. Thurs is my 1st trial out of 2, for the nerve block, that hopefully with stop or seriously reduce head, face, neck and upper back pain.I don't get excited over these things anymore, so many have failed. My dogs are my only happiness.Gardened some this morning, kids were out next door.  So I painted a hopscotch on my drive way for them.yellow boxes and blue letters.

I did get some post surgical depression which is common after joint replacement, but it resolved after a couple of months.  Funny story: I took a trip to Italy last fall with my son.  We went through a bunch of metal detectors and the only one I set off was at the museum where the David is.  The guard looked at me and just waved me on.  I had mixed feelings - I was glad not to try to explain a hip replacement in Italian but slightly miffed that I looked so boring that I could not be a threat!Trina, I am sorry you are feeling bad.  My therapist once told me that when I didn't want to go out and do something to tell my self that my head may not be able to do it, but my feet can.  So I concentrate on my feet, literally - put on socks, then shoes, stand up and watch them walk out the door.  It sounds weird, but it works.  Once I get where I am going I usually feel better about it.  I hope your nerve blocks are successful.Hi Jamie.  Well it looks like my son will most likely not be going to the University of NSW this fall.  He had an interview with a small aerospace company in Denver last week and he hopes to get an interview with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Something or other) in the next few weeks, which is what he really want to do.  Australia is kind of his fall back plan.  Oh well, he doesn't need to be there for me to visit. I had good weather to work in the yard over the weekend and managed not to hurt myself.  A herd of 12 bighorn sheep rams showed up after I mowed the lawn ( I wish they had come before and mowed the lawn for me!).  I got some pictures but when I went to get closer, a pile of dried weeds blew towards them and they ran away. One of the perks of living up here is all the cool  wildlife.  Hope everyone has a good day tomorrow.Kathy",

Hopefully, they will come up with a program that will enable us to get hooked up with the natural gas lines, so we can finally get our roads paved.  The Borough Administrator will be speaking with the Borough Attorney (author of the rent control ordinance) about our rent increases this year.  I strongly believe the landlord used the wrong table from the CPI and is trying to charge us double what they are supposed to.  They served half the tenants with leases to start this month and the rest of us leases to start in August!  Perfectly legal, but it was their failure to have them all prepared at once that caused the different start dates!  Every year, it seems, they screw it up!My back pain is relentless.  I know I could try more injections but I don't want to go under anesthesia again and no guarantee that they will work.  Catch 22.So glad I have a place to 'talk' about such things here.  Those around me get tired of hearing me complain about my pain issues and my depression.  Having the outlet helps so very much.On the bright side, the lilies are starting to bloom, filling the beds with gorgeous color!  The honey suckle is blooming and the scent is intoxicating!  My battle with the bindweed continues, contributing to my back pain...but once I've worked for about 1/2 an hour on it, I get to sit in the back yard and relax and enjoy the view and the scents!  We're to have lower humidity today and I am looking forward to it!Hoping everyone can find their 'bright side' today!",

I just couldn't spend the weekend here alone with my mother in law.  We went to the Great Sand Dunes to see the creek that runs over the sand do this weird surge thing it does during run off.  We also went to the Colorado Gator Farm.  It is a sanctuary for large reptiles out in the middle of this dry valley in southern Colorado.  Part of the attraction is that it is so incongruous here.I am discovering that one of my depression triggers is coming home.  I am responsible for the house, yard and my mother-in-law as well as paying all the bills and it makes me feel overwhelmed.  I can't afford a housekeeper or yard person.  There is a lot of deferred maintenance that my husband just never got around to while he was busy starting other businesses and stuff.  The back steps are about to cave in so I am going to try to replace them.  I'm not even sure which side of a drill to hold, but I'll give it the old college try.   The people in the old days who thought girls should take home ec and boys should take wood shop did not do anyone any favors.Anyway, things in my garden are starting to pop up and my apple trees are finally blooming.  I thought my apricot tree was dead, but it is just late leafing out.  I am actually enjoying digging up dandelions because I am finding plants I forgot I had.  Sort of a treasure hunt.

Much of the housework and petcare is still left to me, as though I was the maid and not the head of household.  The garden is getting overrun by weed vines and isn't looking the way I'd like it to.  I'm having some self worth battles again.My partner is upset by the amount of time I spend on the computer...either following some things on Facebook or researching my daughter's health issues.  She thinks I'm wasting my time with both.  What she doesn't understand is...I have limited social interaction, too many hours to fill in a day, a body that won't cooperate with my mind, a need to feel useful...the computer is now a big part of my life.  I'm not on it when she's here!I'm dropping the committee I've been on for years.  They cancel meetings with no explanation, don't meet in the summer, refuse to 'do the work'...pointless.I have no passion for anything anymore.  If I speak up about how the mobile home park I live in is deteriorating, I'm a 'trouble maker'.  If I try to make sure everyone here is treated fairly by the Landlord, I become the target of the Landlord.  I'm tired of fighting other people's battles for them.  I will finish what I've started but I cannot take on any more.Hopefully, the weather will dry out and I'll be able to dig myself out of this pit once again.Oh, one last thing...I too suffer from mouth pain/tooth pain from the weather.  I use a decongestant now and then and it helps.  Sinus pressure can either give me mouth pain or a headache and sometimes both.HT...I hear you loud and clear about winter wind!

Talk about flash backs!!!I have been MIA, because once again I was in-patient.  Carrier hospital. create place.  Did all the right things this time.  Called a suicide support person,  went to group, brought 2 people home, called [seperated from] husband,  he came right home, we called list of places til. we found a bed. Triggers was seeing a picture of him at a friends daughters wedding with is girlfriend.  I will just say she is more free than me and culturally different in dress, purple hair etc...   I was not told about the wedding.  Friend for 20 plus years have chosen John and he new 34? yr old arm candy.so I have deactivated my Face Back account.  I wanted to keep messenger open for my few acquaintances.  and friends. So with no family of my own, his family not talking to me, his mother telling me he is not cheating, and it was my abuse and my declining health being culprit,  and I should move on. Yea nice uh?AH,   the pity party destroys you every time right!?But I was out in 6 DAYS,  still terrible depressed and in despair but NOT suicidal. I hope everyone is doing better than when Iast postedLYNNWOOD,  I pray your pain is low or gone by now.Pitmom,  hope your issues are settling down,  you have such baggage,  something has got to give!Karen,  sorry the pup and the squirts,  Doodehead, gets them too!,  eats anything that moves!  I can stay out and watch her all the time,  too hot.Peace and strength allTrina",

Still some oddness -- feels like the teeth are bigger than they used to be, and the bite feels off.  Trying to give it time to calm down before seeing the dentist again.  A tiny bit of pain when I bite down on that side. Hope everyone else is well.",

I am getting better at interpreting the Australian lingo.It was hot down in Denver today - 100 degrees F, but freezing in the office.  I have learned to take a light jacket with me in the summer time to wear inside.  I am going to Utah tomorrow for the weekend - it ought to be pretty toasty there too.  I wont  try to do any hiking, maybe I'll go back to the lake.  I had a good therapy session yesterday and I am feeling better about working something out with my brother about the house.  We are both just trying to figure out how to retire with little resources, after all.  Time to go move the sprinkler.  I have the kind that waves back and forth and yesterday I was trying to get it in the right place without going to the faucet and turning it off.  I scooted it back and turned around to run out of the way of the water and wound up doing a \"slip 'n slide\" fall on the wet grass.  I have a bruise on my elbow that doesn't hurt and a sore knee cap that doesn't have a bruise.  But really, not too bad at all.  And I didn't get wet, either!",

And as I got older, I liked going through the books on my parents' bookshelves.Re news. I'm going on Twitter far less than I was. Realised I had a problem when somebody blocked me after a stupid row. I don't care about the person or the row, but I realised the stress of it all was really getting to me. The fear of a no deal Brexit hasn't gone away. That absolute clown, Boris Johnson (think a British Trump), is going to become our new PM next week.

The developer of the SAT test came to realize that all it measured was how good one was at multiple choice tests, but by then it was too late.

You are a good person Rich, always remember that.  We can't help what others did to us when we were young.  It is not us that is the bad person, it is the person or persons who abused us.  So keep doing the things that make you feel better, which are sometimes the hardest things to do.  Just getting dressed is hard for me some days.

Since we survived all that years ago, there has to be a reason, we are still alive to do something good.  Call it Karma, God, Budda, Universal connectiveness.  Whatever the force is, we are here for a reasonWith this in mind  I am slowly learning, along my healing journey that we have a lot to teach the world.  Abuse is talked about more,  there are commercials on TV now asking people to look, listen and report. Deleware is the first state to set up training the hospitals state wide to recognize sex trafficking injuries and to act accordingly to rescue and trail to begin to break up the trade.  I pray every state, and country follows along.Today I too have in my PJs,  chronic head pain,  result of physical abuse.  But you know what,  this pain allows me to be so more tolerant, compassionate and grateful for all I have and encounter.Sure, I go deep into the dark pit once and awhile, my skills bring me out.  My dog literally save my life.  they get me out of bed and outside.  Their unconditional love is priceless. I wish you Peace and strength RichTrina",

When I was drawing it years ago, they made me go to several places every week to apply and re-apply for jobs.  There wasn't that much offered.  And you pretty much had to prove you were able and available for work.  A few years ago, all people had to do was call in to get their checks.  It is never easy for me though.  In the past I got a little help from the department of human services.  What they gave me, they made me work for or pay back.  Just doesn't seem fair to me.  It is sad when you work for a company for 10-20 years and then get let go.  You are right, nothing is permanent anymore.  It is sad...I think here in Michigan you get about 80% of what you were earning, though that may have changed since I drew anything.  And I could be wrong about the 80%, but it was 40-50 years ago.

I know 12-step programs are not for everyone, but thought I would mention it in case you want to try it.As far as unemployment, I didn't have a hard time.  I was unemployed during a period where they allowed you to get benefits for an entire year.  It was about 80% of my earnings, so I did have to cut back on some things.Regarding the rules of umemployment, I just had to keep a log of my job attempts.  It was almost 100% online.  I forget the requirements of how many attempts, but think it was 3 attempts a week.  I logged way more than that.I wish you the best of luck.

Unfortunately, I passed multiple kidney stones and the excruciating pain, stress and lack of self care got me depressed. Not to mention, I lost 3 family members, all on the same day. My depression started of being severe with severe anxiety, now it is more moderate and my anxiety is completely gone! So that\u2019s a positive and I am improving. I try to be as hopeful as I can be. Unfortunately depression runs in my family, so that could also be a factor. I started off taking escitalopram (20mg), I suffered with the side effects but I pushed through and it made me feel better around week 3. However, the more I took, the more confused and dizzy I became so I stopped cold turkey. ( no withdrawals at all). I went on to take Bupropion, which worked- other than I had slight mania- but after 10 days I developed an allergic reaction(swollen face, severe sore throat). Stopped cold turkey, other than diarrhea I was okay. Per my psychiatrist\u2019s suggestion, I tried duloxetine, which gave me an allergic reaction ( swollen face, severe sore throat) over night, so I stopped that. I have a pretty good team of professionals (2 psychologists, 1 psychiatrist, 1 GP and a loving family  ) lined up, but we just don\u2019t seem to find what I need. Does anyone have any experience with allergies to antidepressants? How long did it take to find the right medication? And what did you do to keep yourself encouraged during the trials? Thanks Everyone! L",

                "comment": "HI LSoot,Welcome to the HealingWell Depression support forum.  I don't know a lot of medications by their generic name, so I need to look these up so I know what you have taken and haven't.  Not that I would be any help anyway, but I am curious as to whether you have tried only SSRI's or SNRI's.  I have better luck with the SNRI's.  Not as many side effects.  I have taken bupropion before.  I needed a high dose and it gave me insomnia.  But I didn't have any allergic reactions to any of the medications, just bad side effects.  Being that your anxiety is gone, that is a real good start.  Anxiety really can effect us in bad ways.  I am glad that yours went away.You have been through a lot.  That is no doubt.  But as you said, you have a real good support team and I believe that in time you will get the right medication.  I tried many before I found what worked for me so I know how frustrating it can be.  But you will get there.  I take Pristiq.  Before that I took Effexor for about 15 years.  I have been on Pristiq since 2010.  I take abilify also and as needed Xanax.  My anxiety isn't what it use to be but it arises from time to time.Keep working on things.  You will find what is right for you.  In the meantime I am going to look up the generic names to see what you have taken.Hang in there...Hugs, Karen...",

I was crying and shaking every morning then I got to work and couldn\u2019t function till noon. I am off work now to recover at home so maybe that also helped with the anxiety. My issue is now is that I don\u2019t want to do much. I recently started cooking and cleaning the house. And today I finally laughed a little. My depression is bad in the morning, then around 5-6p.m I feel pretty good. I still try to avoid grocery stores and public indoor places as my fight or flight reaction seems not functioning at all. Feeling pretty good at outdoor public events. Sounds like to me that my norepinephrine level is still off. But soon it will be all good!L",

I figured it was because less is expected of me at that time of day.  Or something like that.  But sometimes I cant' wait to go to bed.  I do okay in the mornings, I get anxious though leaving the house too.My fight or flight is more like freeze.  I am slow to react I think.  But maybe I am just slow to think.

I am going to see another psychiatrist next Wednesday. We will see what she/he thinks. I am terrified of taking any antidepressants with all the side effects and allergic reaction that I had.

I\u2019m just curious if it can possibly be an alternative for someone like me who his very sensitive to pills.

They are older drugs but can work really well.  They gave me a dry mouth and constipation but I dealt with that by drinking a lot of water and taking fiber tabs.  I stopped them because this was 33 years ago and there was a terrible stigma about having any type of mental illness and I was worried someone would find out. But they actually worked for me.Regular exercise can be very helpful also.",

When this happens we mourn for what we lose without realizing perhaps we should switch our mind set to being grateful for what we still do have, though this will never fully eliminate the pain and the void it may help ease it. Nothing will bring back your son but a new puppy or kitten could bring some much needed mutual love and attempt to fill that void that you feel in your heart when this happens. As others have said time does seem to do it's thing, some days may be worse than others but in the long term,weeks and months should get easier. I pray and hope for the best.

We must listen to how bodies screaming for TLC.  Our minds needing quiet after a good cleansing cry. It is all part of long healing process so you can move on.  Your body knows how to make the rawness intoa  softy loss, eventually misty soft fog of loss that you can handle on a day to day basis Hold on, practice self compassion.  When stuff ask your self what would I say to a friend in the same situation?  Take your own advice. Peaceand Strength",

I don't remember the authors name, only that she claimed to be in communication with those that had crossed over.  I have no opinion, one way or the other, on the subject BUT one thing she said that stuck with me...the manner of death ceases to matter to the one that died, once they have died.  It only matters to those left behind.  She claims that each of them wants each of us to stop focusing on the manner in which they died.Giving myself something to think about instead really helped me.  My father was alone the day he died.  No one knows exactly what happened.  The neighbor tells us that he was alerted to something being wrong because the dog was out loose.  We'd always kept her on a line, even though the yard was fenced, because she would jump the fence.  Yet, here she was, out of the yard!  Running in circles as the neighbor got out of his car.  When he brought her home, he saw the front door open and my father on the floor.  We can only assume he knew something was wrong and had let her out in hopes she would get attention.I struggled for a very long time over that day.  Mother had gone to Delaware to visit her Mother.  I had been at church that morning and was to look in on Dad afterward.  I blamed myself for staying on after service, chatting with other members.  \"If only...\" dogged my every waking minute and kept me from sleep.I cannot tell you that 'It gets better'...only that at some point, it stops consuming us.  The days drag, but the years fly by.  I don't believe anyone is ever really 'gone'.  I've felt my Dad's hand on my shoulder.  I've smelled his cologne mixed with the smell of lighter fluid (he carried a Zippo in his pocket most of his life).  An unusual combination, not likely to be randomly duplicated.  Always when he wanted to 'tell me something' or more to the point 'remind me of something he'd taught me'.  I grow lilacs for my Mother, red roses for my Dad.  They help me.  Perhaps planting something for his memory will help you, too.  These plants are not green all year.  They bloom for a short while and then they slumber...only to return again when the time is right.  As I believe we all do.I wish you peace and comfort.",

There was nothing to do. I grieved that friendship for many years. In doing family history, I had a grandmother who grieved the death of a young son for many years. I realized my grieving for a loss was partly inherited. Other people got over such things much quicker. I didn\u2019t. I just had to let it run its course, just like my grandmother. Gradually, something else began to interest me in life. But it took a while. Nothing I could do in the meantime to speed it up.                           ----------------------------  Grieving --\"So it\u2019s true, when all is said and done, grief is the price we pay for love.\u201d \u2015 E.A.

I didn\u2019t quite catch on to the legal side of this.   You said on 5-8-2019:\u201cCoroners report was inaccurate and based on assumptions \u201cDoes anyone know what type of person I should contact to pursue an investigation for lack of a true investigation of accidental vs suicide or possible homicide?\u201cIt\u2019s not the Police\u201cThey refuse to give me the report.\u201dOne person said, \u201cMaybe a lawyer? They have private investigators they use for cases. Or at least they may be able to direct you in the way to go.\u201dAnother said, \u201cI agree with Kathy, a lawyer or private investigator. You need closure for this. Therefore you need to know what exactly happened.\u201d-----------------------------------I agree with the suggestions. I\u2019ve had two experiences with this. One, a woman I know needed a lawyer to help with a false charge by police. Turned out, there was no false charge, she was guilty. But I didn\u2019t figure that out until after I had tried to find her a lawyer.So I did learn about \u201charrassment\u201d type lawyers, which I also needed because of some bad neighbors, but I didn\u2019t have the inner strength for all of that, but now I have the knowledge of that. For someone else, I typed into the search engine, \u201clawyers for my hometown.\u201d  Went through the listings looking only for the type of lawyer I wanted. Harrassment. You can look for whatever the category you might be interested in. In another situation, because of neighborhood problems, I wanted a private detective. I did that on my own. Same thing, typed into the search engine, \u201cdetectives for my home town.\u201d I wrote down 4 or 5 or 6 names, called a few until I got to one I liked. Then, the problem stopped with the neighbor, so I didn\u2019t need the detective. But that\u2019s what I would do in your case. I would get a lawyer who handles the type of matter you are concerned about. If you want a female lawyer, they\u2019ve got those. That was my first choice, also.A lawyer can then perhaps recommend a private detective. If she doesn\u2019t and you still want one, you can still get one on your own. I would first talk to the lawyer. She can tell you right over the phone whether she handles that, and what she might or might not be able to do. The phone call is free. Once you get a few names from the computer, calling and talking to her is very easy.I\u2019ve seen these kinds of cases on TV where the police/coroner get these things right sometimes and they get them wrong sometimes. A lawyer can get the police/coroner\u2019s reports better than you can.       ----------------You said you had already talked with one lawyer and \"He said there is nothing he can do- I have to deal with the police and if they won't co-operate contact the District Attorney.\"Well, maybe get a second opinion. You don't really know how accurate the first person is until you talk with a second or a third. You have nothing to compare it with. I would get a second lawyer's opinion and see what she thinks. And you can get free 2nd and 3rd opinions as you go down your list of lawyers that you choose from all the others on the net listing, and get their free opinion right there on the phone.Post Edited (Tim Tam) : 6/10/2019 5:58:34 PM (GMT-6)",

Asking for money is completely unacceptable and should be reported to the group leader before you leave, in my opinion. I do know what you mean about people monopolising meetings. A good group leader really ought to prevent that and give everyone a chance to speak equally. Groups can be a positive thing, but it doesn't sound like your one is being run well, which is most unfortunate. Whatever benefit you could get, you're not getting it. If you can afford it, I would definitely try one to one counselling. I am sorry about your vacation not providing a respite. Maybe for now you'd be better off with finding a new place without any memories :/ The old place will always be there, waiting for you when you're ready to go back. As for the job you hate, any chance of being able to get another job? I know jobs are hard to come by these days, but if it's possible, I would consider looking for another job. With a better boss.

According to this book all souls go home and are not judged. There is only love and light. Those who don't believe are enlightened by guides once there and are naturally inclined to see the truth.Despite my Catholic upbringing which I do not practice, my spirituality has led me to believe this same account and it brings me peace as my old teachings have been getting in my way and causing me fear. It is good to have a 4 day weekend because I have needed quiet reflection time. So glad I have one more day tomorrow.",

You said you are on 300mg daily for years, that is scary. Why would one need such high dose for years?I have depression/major depressive disorder for the last 5 years. Undiagnosed and untreated. I just started the treatment 3 weeks back. Also taking SNRI for serotonin and norepinephrine. My mood is good, and subtle improvement in norepinephrine memory attention sharpness. My arousals and desires, engagement in desires, deriving pleasures those functionalities are dead. That is the main problem.  I guess depression of many years changes/lowers the receptors in the brain. Taking Tyrosine and other supplements does not help. Bupropion is a receptor agonist, I wonder how long it takes to restore normal receptor density and activity. What do you think of this?",

I do have episodes of major depression but it is still different than classic major depressive disorder.  It is not going to go away, sort of like any other chronic disease.  300 mg of bupropion is the most common dose, 450mg per day is the maximum dose.  I have not suffered any consequences from being on this for the last 17 years.  Bupropion is also one of the few antidepressants with few to no side effects regarding intimate relations.Depression is a multifactorial disease: it doesn't have one specific cause. The reasons for a decrease in the neurotransmitters is not specifically known.  There is a decrease in the specific receptors in the brains of people with depression and I don't know if that can be reversed.  The question is sort of like the \"chicken and the egg\" - which came first - the depression or the decreased transmitters?  That is why medical treatment focuses on increasing the amount of neurotransmitter available by blocking it's reuptake and sort of flooding the remaining receptors. Many people with major depression do recover and only take antidepressants for months rather than years. So take heart.  And also remember, that since depression is a multifactorial disease, it has other treatments that are just as effective as medication (especially when used in combination) such as talk therapy and exercise)  I strongly suggest that you do one or both of these also.I hope this helps and wasn't too preachy.  Each one of us is different and treatment needs to be tailored specifically for you, so work closely with your provider and don't give up hope.  And feel free to keep asking questions.  If I can't answer them, at least I can commiserate.",

                "comment": "Hi everyone. I need some advice and frankly I don't have anyone to talk to very comfortably and it has been on my mind for a while now so... here goes nothing! I have a boyfriend of a different race and religion for a few years and when we first started frankly he wasn't very good to me. He was very unwelcoming when I came over to his place, every cent counts when it comes to bills whether it's for food etc, always wanted me to shut my mouth around his parents. But for some reason I stuck around like glue, which I admit is very stupid of me. I confronted him and he started acknowledging and started to change until recently he thought it was fine to go out with his friends constantly, who nearly always talks bad of me. They always say things like 'oh why is she so clingy' or 'don't you want to find some other girl?' But they pretend to be nice towards me. I was super offended and confronted him, but the first thing he did was argue and tried to convince me that I was just overreacting and that he just wanted to go out and have fun with his buddies. It took 2 nights of my anger for him to realize. Now, he seems really regretful of all the things he has done and really is keen to change. But my family is also rather conservative thus the differing race and religion is a real issue as well. Needless to say, my family is quite discouraging. I've talked to him about religion and he said he's willing to convert for my sake once marriage rolls around, though I'm so afraid that he would change his mind when we're too far into our relationship. I'm so afraid that after marriage, he would change. Or if he can't live up to his words. Yet, there's something in me that keeps on coming back to him. Like the way we are able to share everything to each other, which nobody else has that sort of relationship with me. So I'm just walking in the dark, and in fear. Please, I need advice. What should I do? Should I break up with him for my family's sake? Should I continue this relationship even if I keep on losing faith and trust? I'm so confused. Thank you for helping.",

                "comment": "Wow...  I don't like him treating you bad.  Are you sure he wont go back to that?  If you are serious about marriage, I would give it a long engagement.  I think you need to get to know him better.  It doesn't sound like you been together a real long time.  With differences in culture there is going to be a lot of give and take honestly.  You two have to compromise.  I am not trying to scare you away from him.  I know you will do what is in your heart.  People do seem to change after marriage.  I don't know why.  My husband and I have been together for 18 years and friends for years before that.  I still find things new about him. Some I like, some I don't.  So tread lightly and pay attention.  Take it one day at a time, and don't rush into anything.  Like I say it is give and take.  When he is with his friends find things to do that you enjoy.  You don't want to get in between him and his friends.  He will grow to resent you if you do.  Talk to him calmly maybe about limiting some of his time.  But don't expect him to let his life revolve around you.  It is like you kind of do your own thing and then meet in the middle. . Share responsibilities.  There is so much to marriage, but you should take it one day at a time.  Don't rush into anything.I wish you the best.Hugs, Karen...",
