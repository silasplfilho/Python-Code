So here\u2019s my story... I was on Pristiq for about 10 years and it was working quite well.  I\u2019ve also been sick with Lyme disease and coinfections which cause depression and anxiety and pain.  In February my Dr decided to switch me to Cymbalta, that it might help more with pain.  I wasn\u2019t too happy to change since pristiq was still working.  Cymbalta ended up causing gut problems and I ended up becoming sensitive to all grains and could only eat protein and veggies.  After the summer we switched back to Pristiq 50mg.  Month went by and I just was feeling terrible with lots of anxiety. Oh, also, in the past few months my hubby was diagnosed Bipolar and has been manic for over a year which has been extremely stressful.  about 3 weeks ago my dose was raised to 100mg.  Still not feeling any better but know it could take 4+ weeks to kick in.  My Dr. added Wellbutrin 150 to help Pristiq work better.I\u2019m on my 2nd day of Wellbutrin and anxiety got better with 1st dose.  My biggest side effect is increased pain.  This is a problem bc I\u2019m already on prescription pain meds for widespread pain and now my pain is not controlled.  I\u2019m wondering if any of you had increased pain when starting Wellbutrin and did it go away after a few weeks?  I fight hard every day to control the pain and really don\u2019t want to have pain 24 hours a day.  Other than that, no major side effects, just a little nausea.", "commentTimestamp": "Today 4:36 PM (GMT -7)"}]}, {"last_date": "Yesterday 7:36 PM", "author": "getting by", "title": "Daily check in thread for all!!!  #189...", "views": "1652 views", "link": "/community/default.aspx?f=19&m=4160731", "postContent": [{"commentAuthor": "getting by", "comment": "Hi everybody,I realized our other thread hit 99 posts so I posted to finish it up.

When thoughts become unhelpful, it's worth considering if more helpful thoughts can be found..For example, a thought might be that the planet is heating up and weather is getting more extreme. That thought might be helpful, or it might evoke anxiety.

I got married again and have a baby 2019. My mom came here for almost 5months. in someways she help me. She\u2019s old and can\u2019t stand and she can\u2019t walk longer. I have my son for almost 10months. I notice lately that\u2019s my mood is way worst. My mom left September but I feel so terrible. I talked to my doctor but he put me into counseling first because might Help with what I feel. It\u2019s been 3months I feel crapty. Went again to a new doctor because it\u2019s a military thing that every 2years the doctors went to some places. Anyways, made an appointment for my PCM, told everything what I feel he prescribed me with Zoloft 50mg and been taking it for 2days now. I\u2019m still breastfeeding my son. I didn\u2019t know it will happen to me that I need medicine. Been avoiding to take and keep denying to myself that I am okay and will get better but the more I fight for what I feel the more it got worst. I am hoping and praying I will be better soon.

Though I am sorry for what you are going through right now.  Did you tell the doctor you are breast feeding?  Did he say that the Zoloft was safe?  It can take up to eight weeks for the medication to reach full potential but there is a chance you will feel better way before that.  If the doctor said it was safe, I would take them.  It is hard when you have to constantly change doctors.  I think it takes awhile for the doctor patient relationship to build.  Then to have to get another one, that can be unnerving.  So I understand how you are feeling.Are you still going to counseling?  If you get a good counselor it can help so much.  Another thing that helps is to get self help books on depression.  I have read a lot of them and they always help some.  You could be going through depression due to having a child.  Post partum I believe it is called.  Your hormones can go whacko and you end up feeling depressed, but that usually goes away.  Keep doing what you are doing.  Maybe get some books.

Let me catch you guys up. Had my first baby this past Feb. the bay is happy and healthy but unfortunately I experienced some severe post pardum depression for a month or two afterwards. I\u2019m on medication and was feeling better until some big life changes- we bought a house and just had to put down my life-long dog last week. He was ill for a while but being a big dog lover and having had him in my life for over 13 years, I\u2019m feeling really down. So where I\u2019m at now- still having a difficult time with daily functions. My support system is great. I go to counseling every other week. My parents watch my daughter and my husband is great. I\u2019m on medication to help with the depression and anxiety. Recently swapped to try and better manage the anxiety. More specifically I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed with the feeling of sadness and grief about my dog. I miss him terribly. I just go through the motions for my daughter and try to keep it together to do functions of the day- make dinner, do laundry, make sure stuff gets done, etc. Sometimes all I want to do is disappear. I know my daughter needs me and her life is better with me. I won\u2019t do anything to hurt myself. Let\u2019s get that straight. But....when my husband and I get into a tift or I\u2019m having a bad day, I can\u2019t help think, wow, this place would be so much better without me. I just wish I didn\u2019t exist.

None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.  Scared their Camelot lives would be shattered. Even to day,  When I sit in stillness, I find peace.  I have no anger towards them.  I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on. I believe forgiveness is different for each person.

I had 2 boxes of donations for them tooI bought 2 large bag of books, however I wrote in my journal the experience was not fun and did not find anything speacial.Today 10/27/19, I went through the books.20 in all. 7 large prints that were free, I sell them on ebay.The other 13 were special in their own way6 of them date from 1836 - 1921 I adore antique books!So, amazingly, even though I felt on auto pilot, I was actually looking for things I liked. I believe I turned my emotions to numb. I know I dissociated because it is a bit foggy, except for driving home.What I take away from this is, once I decide to get out and challenge the urge to isolate; using mindfulness may not be necessary, although it would enhance the expierence. For me, mindfulness would make it easier the next time.We all forget skills, being in survival mode takes a lot of energy and beating ourselves up is not going to make anything better.So self-compassion and mindfulness together could help us challenge isolation.PeaceTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

Had fish for a while also, but to much with the tank, filter etc...Walking helps me,  sitting the park and watching kids.   I watch baseball.  Don't follow it or any team,  I enjoy the game, the plays etc.... Most days I have force myself to do things, but once I get going I feel better.  We deserve more than we feel,  I practice self-compassion and mindfulness.I honestly would not know where I would be without these skills in my daily life.  Heck these aren't even skills anymore,  it as become a change of life style for me.  I have become more thoughtful and gentler in many ways.

Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener.I would have the same problem, being attentive to everyone else and being a good listener.  I tend to be an impatient person, and while I can easily be empathetic with the struggles of someone else, I'm afraid my impatience would come through.  It is eye opening, though, isn't it, that perspective you gain when getting out amongst other people and discovering that many people are at least as sad as you are, and some are much worse, with good reason.

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.  I have been giving much thought to my parents.  Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.  As I deal with my personal depression, I have been enlightened to some degree with this group effort.

That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.  But wouldn't it be so sweet if it were possible that I could get that hug I so desperately needed/need and want and you could have that heart to heart talk with your father.Post Edited (MitzMN) : 10/22/2018 5:33:04 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": 1540236360.0}, {"commentAuthor": "cloudy", "comment": "We all have our life stories.

This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder recently and have had issues with finding the right antidepressant. I'm starting to have some side effects and would like to know when they'll ease off. I'm getting a bit anxious and restless to the point of wanting to do something but can't keep my mind on said action. Is that normal? And I'm starting to have some issues sleeping. I've been on Cipralex with good success and wanted to be switched to that after I got off Luvox, but my family doctor switched me to Cymbalta. Should I have fought harder for that medication, or should I see how this new one works? I am feeling better, but I'd like to sleep better and focus.

I don't think I have seen you here before.  I have never taken Cymbalta, but was curious as to how long you been on it and when the side effects started.  Generally side effects go away in a week to ten days.  Some stay with you though.  I started Lexapro a couple of months ago and recently noticed constipation.  I have gained five pounds from it.  If I don't gain anymore I will still be happy but if it gets worse, I think I will ask about another med.  I would give the medication a chance, say six to eight weeks while you wait for it to get to it's full potential.  Then you should know whether or not you want to stay on it.I hope that it works well for you.

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.

Had a very productive day.  Was up at 4:18 am, thanks to the dogs.  My laundry was done before 9 a.m.!  Then, I dressed and went to the hardware store, got my paint, came home and got busy.  Primed the ceiling, painted the ceiling, filled the holes in the walls, painted one coat on the walls.  Tomorrow I'll get the second coat on the walls and when they're dry, I'll start moving the furniture that I can manage by myself into there.  I chose a very, very light lavender since the room is rather dark with only the one window.I have 2 tall, metal shelving units, a desk and chair, three Sterlite (plastic) dressers, a china cabinet and a shoe rack to get moved!  The shelving has to be taken apart in the living room, parts carried into the 'office' and reassembled there.  The hall is too narrow to move them 'as is'.  The desk will squeeze through, though.  I've already moved the dressers a couple of times (plastic is so nice for this) but I will definitely need help with the china cabinet.  It was my Mother's and I plan to store my linens in it.  The shoe rack is plastic, too.Then, I can get rid of the heavy computer cabinet, move the buffet and put the t.v. on that!  I've been keeping my eyes open for a little 2 seat dinette.  The place is really coming together!!  I can't wait to move my bed around and be able to walk around it...which will make it so much easier to make in the mornings!

When thoughts become unhelpful, it's worth considering if more helpful thoughts can be found..For example, a thought might be that the planet is heating up and weather is getting more extreme. That thought might be helpful, or it might evoke anxiety.

Not sure. Let me start with my depression. When I get here in the US I don\u2019t have depression it\u2019s just accumulated everyday. New country,new life. My late husband past away 2016. I got married again and have a baby 2019. My mom came here for almost 5months. in someways she help me. She\u2019s old and can\u2019t stand and she can\u2019t walk longer. I have my son for almost 10months. I notice lately that\u2019s my mood is way worst. My mom left September but I feel so terrible. I talked to my doctor but he put me into counseling first because might Help with what I feel. It\u2019s been 3months I feel crapty. Went again to a new doctor because it\u2019s a military thing that every 2years the doctors went to some places. Anyways, made an appointment for my PCM, told everything what I feel he prescribed me with Zoloft 50mg and been taking it for 2days now. I\u2019m still breastfeeding my son. I didn\u2019t know it will happen to me that I need medicine. Been avoiding to take and keep denying to myself that I am okay and will get better but the more I fight for what I feel the more it got worst. I am hoping and praying I will be better soon. I\u2019m a stay at home mom, with no help with the baby. My husband is so great. He help with everything. I cried everyday, I want to get better. And appreciate what I have.

Though I am sorry for what you are going through right now.  Did you tell the doctor you are breast feeding?  Did he say that the Zoloft was safe?  It can take up to eight weeks for the medication to reach full potential but there is a chance you will feel better way before that.  If the doctor said it was safe, I would take them.  It is hard when you have to constantly change doctors.  I think it takes awhile for the doctor patient relationship to build.  Then to have to get another one, that can be unnerving.  So I understand how you are feeling.Are you still going to counseling?  If you get a good counselor it can help so much.  Another thing that helps is to get self help books on depression.  I have read a lot of them and they always help some.  You could be going through depression due to having a child.  Post partum I believe it is called.  Your hormones can go whacko and you end up feeling depressed, but that usually goes away.  Keep doing what you are doing.  Maybe get some books.  Keep posting too, it helps to write things out.I hope that you feel better soon.Hugs, Karen...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)", "commentTimestamp": 1574188740.0}, {"commentAuthor": "Bik31", "comment": "Hi Karen,I\u2019m on my 3rd day now with Zoloft.

What happen to me no one will watch my son. I really hate this feeling that I can\u2019t control my brain. Before the medicine, I feel like my brain will explode from over thinking, my neck is hurting like hell from over fatigue. Can\u2019t figure out what hobby I want to occupy my time.

I will be on medication for the rest of my life and I accept it.  I try not to think about the future, just the moment I am in.  I took Zoloft before but it wasn't the med for me.  I got real skinny on it.  I tried many before I found what worked.  I know it is probably the safest drug while breast feeding.  Maybe after you can try something else.  Take it one day at a time.

Let me catch you guys up. Had my first baby this past Feb. the bay is happy and healthy but unfortunately I experienced some severe post pardum depression for a month or two afterwards. I\u2019m on medication and was feeling better until some big life changes- we bought a house and just had to put down my life-long dog last week. He was ill for a while but being a big dog lover and having had him in my life for over 13 years, I\u2019m feeling really down. So where I\u2019m at now- still having a difficult time with daily functions. My support system is great. I go to counseling every other week. My parents watch my daughter and my husband is great. I\u2019m on medication to help with the depression and anxiety. Recently swapped to try and better manage the anxiety. More specifically I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed with the feeling of sadness and grief about my dog. I miss him terribly. I just go through the motions for my daughter and try to keep it together to do functions of the day- make dinner, do laundry, make sure stuff gets done, etc. Sometimes all I want to do is disappear. I know my daughter needs me and her life is better with me. I won\u2019t do anything to hurt myself. Let\u2019s get that straight. But....when my husband and I get into a tift or I\u2019m having a bad day, I can\u2019t help think, wow, this place would be so much better without me. I just wish I didn\u2019t exist. Idk if if that\u2019s me talking or the depression. It\u2019s hard to say when you\u2019re in the thick of it. I don\u2019t even know if this is considered post pardum any more since I\u2019m technically 9 months after giving birth to my daughter. I mean, idk. It\u2019s been a month or so since I\u2019ve switched medications too, so I\u2019d think I\u2019d have seen a difference. It\u2019s only been a week and a half since the passing of my precious dog though. Idk.

I have put 9 dogs down in my life.  Always a sad and troubling time.  I usely adopt another dog with a month.However, do not suggest you do this.  With a baby, therapy, new home,  it would be too much.  Once you are settled,  feeling better you may think about it. Post pardon can last for a couple years from what I understand.  Have you to your OBGYN about it? I think this would be a great idea.   Also be 100% honest with your therapist if you are comfortable. If you are not comfortable with your therapist,  look for another.

None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.  Scared their Camelot lives would be shattered. Even to day,  When I sit in stillness, I find peace.  I have no anger towards them.  I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on. I believe forgiveness is different for each person.

I had 2 boxes of donations for them tooI bought 2 large bag of books, however I wrote in my journal the experience was not fun and did not find anything speacial.Today 10/27/19, I went through the books.20 in all. 7 large prints that were free, I sell them on ebay.The other 13 were special in their own way6 of them date from 1836 - 1921 I adore antique books!So, amazingly, even though I felt on auto pilot, I was actually looking for things I liked. I believe I turned my emotions to numb. I know I dissociated because it is a bit foggy, except for driving home.What I take away from this is, once I decide to get out and challenge the urge to isolate; using mindfulness may not be necessary, although it would enhance the expierence. For me, mindfulness would make it easier the next time.We all forget skills, being in survival mode takes a lot of energy and beating ourselves up is not going to make anything better.So self-compassion and mindfulness together could help us challenge isolation.PeaceTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.  I have been giving much thought to my parents.  Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.

That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.  But wouldn't it be so sweet if it were possible that I could get that hug I so desperately needed/need and want and you could have that heart to heart talk with your father.Post Edited (MitzMN) : 10/22/2018 5:33:04 PM (GMT-6)", "commentTimestamp": 1540236360.0}, {"commentAuthor": "cloudy", "comment": "We all have our life stories.

We all would do things and think things out differently if we could turn back the clock.People who tell you they \"would not change a thing\" are not being truthful.  There are always regrets over lost opportunities, lost loves, lost friends and any number of situations.  In my case I have lost close friends for reasons I can't explain.  This  in particular has happened  with what I considered 3 times in my life.  In each case these people are still alive although they live in different areas of the country.  The fact that they have all had great financial success  must be a factor.  Monetary wealth seems to cause a breakdown in shared interests and the ability to share experiences.  Although I am not poor and struggling, I don't regret being lower on the social scene.With the group therapy exercise I am presently involved in, the other people who suffer with depression also have very diverse backgrounds and an endless stream of problems, both real and perceived.  Lives that have been shattered by deaths, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and other mental problems.I don't know your personal present situation.  I hope you have someone close.

This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.  It can be used as needed and can quit anytime without tapering.  The trick to it is \"low doses\".
