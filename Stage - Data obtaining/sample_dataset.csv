Life just great isn't it...;1;bifcv3;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bifcv3/welp_life_just_great_isnt_it/;0;2019-04-28 17:02:48;"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag... wait no wrong sentence... anyways I was meant to say, ever feel like life is just slapping you down. And down. And down until your just looking up like 'wtf did I do to get delt this hand in life?' Well that's how I'm feeling now, certainly the state I'm in ain't as bad as most, and my upbringing probably want as bad as most of the heinous stuff other redditers have been through but this shit still hurts me. 

For as long as I can remember I've been bullied by girls and boys alike, judged, tormented, called names, and just been the butt of most jokes(up until like yr 9 which is 13-14 where I got big), but surprisingly I got it worse from the girls, always calling me 'weird' which arguably back then I was,  and said I was ugly, annoying, and just in general got laughed at alot. Now whilst going through all this I've never really had many friends, I'd say about 7 real friends spanning my whole life, each drifting in and out of it over time, and I never really had one person to talk to about being the butt of all these jokes, and how much they're effecting me. In turn i missed a lot of school because i just didn't want to be put through it.

Whilst all this shit is going on my family is slowly breaking down, my parents fighting every night, my only brother left at home not giving a shit about it, and just going on as normal whereas I was a shit show, especially when my dad tried to kill himself. Still no one knew about any of the stuff in my life and mostly still don't and I dotn talk to anyone about it and I'm 18 now and I'm just hurting... like I have no actual friends (the people I hang around with all ditched me in yr 11 i was 16 and they ghosted me for a whole year which made me have bad trust issues) 

I cant interact with girls face to face because of all the trauma I've faced from bullying from other girls when I was younger, and I know this because I talked to this girl for a while, and were both going great were happy but we went on a trip to barcalona with the college and I couldn't interact with her at all unless I was drunk. She called it quits a week later (apparently because shes not over her ex, but imo that just seemed like a convenient excuse to dup on my boring quiet ass) I mean I'm over her now but the principles there I cant have any real interactions with people, make friends, or have a relationship because I'm just so fucked in the fucking head. And it's just making me feel like pure shit. And I assume that other people will relate but I just feel like I want to die, but I dont want to die? Like I want to be alive just not exist. Idk it weird. But I just dont see how I can get past this stage in my life. It's just an to big barrier, and I feel like I should just stay away from relationships, new friendships and just be lonely and just chug along being the guy with no friends or partner, even though I want friends and a relationship I just think I'd be too boring and quiet for them to like me... idk.... I guess I just dotn know what to do...


TLDR : Messed childhood made it impossible to make friends and have relationships because I'm quiet and boring (imo)  and I think I should just give up on making friends, and getting into relationships and just be lonely for the rest of my life.";IWEDnormag

Since I moved here, I have been suffering immensely with mental health difficulties. I am basically at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. For some background, I suffer from OCD and depression. I have suffered from these for most of my life and have (mostly) been able to cope. However, since my move, I have been unable to cope. I attempted suicide a few months ago and I am living in a constant state of torment.

What I need the most help with is how to handle work while I am dealing with all of these issues. I currently have a job that I absolutely hate. It was sold to me as a finance job that would be a great career change from working in higher education. The job is not at all what it was made out to be. I basically do glamorous call centre work and collect debt from people. It's brutal, I haven't been trained properly and it causes me insane amounts of stress. I sincerely believe that this job has worsened my mental health issues, leading to another nervous breakdown this week. On Friday I melted down and was sent for an emergency hospital evaluation and I have been scheduled for an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist for Friday.

I have told my boss about my mental health issues and she has been supportive, but I guess I don't know what to do from here. I am looking for a new job, but the search is obviously going to take a few months and I'm not sure how to cope with this?

And as someone who’s been dealing with these for as long as I can remember and getting noticeably, progressively worse,, I can’t help but want to put an end to my confusion. 

Going to the GP to get professionally diagnosed seems out of the question to me, as I am 16 and do not want my family to find out. At all. Ever. And school counselling is just the same.

I've  always struggled with depression and anxiety, along with some childhood  trauma that's affected me throughout my whole life and I've sadly  allowed this to affect my previous 2 jobs and it's had a significant  impact on my wellbeing.

I was told by  my former manager that they know I'm going through a hard time at home,  but I'm also not learning at the right pace and am quite slow, and that  with how things are - I would be fired but because they like me and want  to give me a chance, they didn't fire me yet. I passed my probation but  didn't really improve, I'm not sure if it was because of the training  and my manager's vague way of explaining things (or if it was me having  low esteem from depression/the past etc) I struggle a lot with maths and  that job required a lot of basic maths skills that I was not able to  understand despite my manager being so patient with me (she ended up  getting really stressed and frustrated). What hurt me the most was after  I had left this particular job, management had praised me and said I  was doing so well. I don't know why I suddenly started improving and  became their ideal candidate after handing in my notice.

The  most recent job I had, I had quit because it was absolutely toxic and  sent me into overdrive for each day I was working there and I was  getting bullied by quite a few higher ups - and no one would believe me  when I confided in a few colleagues. I felt that I was being targeted a  lot and I was pulled into meetings about every small detail/thing that I  did wrong.

I do see a therapist  regularly and I just want to know without rambling too much, how do I  get past that I'm not good enough? I'm constantly worried I won't be  good enough for any job now. I don't want to victimise, although I'm  aware I am doing it. I just want to know how I can develop the  confidence, be willing to make mistakes and not let the past bother me?

I started cutting and was just crying all the time. Part of the reason for this was feeling hurt from my friends. I was trying to explain to one of them how they hurt me, but they just trivialized everything to ""being in my head"" and really made it seem like they did nothing to hurt me. This friend is also someone I have gone to about my cutting now that I have started. I have spent the past few weeks trying to get my friend to realize how they have hurt me because their ignorance just felt insulting. Anyways, I finally reached a point in the semester where I felt genuinely happy. I even stopped cutting! Then, I wrote my friend this letter, which looking back, was written very depressingly but the purpose had been to convey that the friend did not seem to care for our friendship and it hurts that they do this to me and I no longer want to feel this way and continue ""crying and cutting"" about a relationship that is inevitably over. That letter prompted my friend to grow concerned for me (so apparently they DO care) and report me to an RA. Now, campus staff know and are forcing me to create an action plan with them that includes going to therapy (which I already started going to on my own) and it just makes me feel like I'm under the spotlight.

26;Feeling lost;2;bierps;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bierps/feeling_lost/;1;2019-04-28 16:11:18;"&#x200B;

So I've struggled with depression for about 3 years and it has fluctuated from mild to severe in that time period

I have managed to live with it for the most part however these past few months I seem to have completely lost grip of my life. My relationship has fallen apart due to my illness and she has moved on quickly which hurts like hell. I drink and use drugs more often than I ever have to escape my problems because i'm not scared of what could go wrong. I impulsively attempted suicide after a particularly heavy day of drinking 2 weeks ago and it has worried my friends and family.

I am currently taking antidepressants (celexa) and going to cognitive behavioural therapy but it doesn't seem to be working out for me. I am going to my last therapy session tomorrow and whilst initially it seemed like it was going well I am spiralling into the darkness very quickly and at the moment it seems my next suicide attempt is more of a when than an if, although this time I aren't proud to say I won't make the mistake of failing.

So i'm here to vent. I want to get my feelings out and try articulate them even if no one reads or responds (although it would be nice to hear some thoughts or ideas on how I can get myself out of this.)

So, firstly - my relationship. I can't blame anyone for this except myself, even if it hurts and makes me so angry when I see her with her new interest. Throughout the relationship I was distant, I found it hard to get out and do things with her. I assured her it wasn't her and that it was my illness making me feel this way, and that I loved her. She waited for me for a long time, but after countless discussions of how it was making her feel, I made her hard decision easy by letting her go. She was too good for me, I hate how I made her feel, how lonely she was, I hate how much she loved me because I am a piece of shit who couldn't see what I had and now she's gone I feel awful for putting her through it. I still love her, and every night my emotions take over and I get thrown into a mix of ugly emotions, such as rage, regret, jealousy and sadness. This makes me drink, and I drink until I have forgotten my problems and passed out. I know how hard this is for me because I was in a similar situation with my ex girlfriend and that made me feel very low. I hope she's happy but I hope she doesn't forget me, because that would break my heart even more.

Secondly, my suicide attempt. It's the second time that my reckless decisions have nearly taken my life. The first was  a serious overdose on a cocktail of illicit drugs, the second was a desperate attempt due to having a breakdown after a night of drinking (overdosing on my antidepressants and taking ketamine/mdma and drinking a lot of alcohol.) I thought I was at my lowest before I took the overdose but damn, waking up in hospital alone was a whole lot worse. I was in a lot of pain and in a state of confusion, I didn't know what was going on and I had no one I knew around me to tell me. As scary as this was, ever since I can't shake this feeling off that I should have died. The life I'm living now is borrowed time, because I don't want to live, I can't handle my illness for much longer. Especially not on my own. The only person who made me feel better was my ex girlfriend and she has now gone, and I don't blame her. It's hard to love someone who is going through something like this. She never understood fully how I felt because it's impossible for me to tell her. I can't describe the turmoil I go through every day, and that must have been very hard for her. I just hope she knows I love her and that it had to happen for her to live a happy life.

I'm just at the end of my rope. I have tried holding on, tried having hope, but nothing seems to be working. It's a dark road and i'm lost on it, I don't know where to go from here. I can't see a saving grace, even though I have friends and family who love me. It's just all too much to handle and I wanted someone to know so I posted here. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far I guess, hope you're doing well. If you are going through anything, for what it's worth I love you as a person and hope you can find the light.";scottzeh

I’m having trouble recovering from an extremely painful break up even though it was a year ago.

I suppose I should at least give a bit of detail before I get started. I’m 20 years old and I suffer from Aspergers and bipolar disorder and unlike other people with bipolar my mood can shift from happy to extremely depressed in almost an instant at any time and for any length of time without any sort of trigger. My parents had divorced a year after I was born and I was bullied daily for about half my life. To put it simply isolation is no stranger.

About a year ago I began dating a girl whom I had fawned over for my entire high school life and to be honest with her I was truly happy in a way I had never felt before not even in past relationships. Time passed and we eventually moved in together (against my families wishes) and had gotten an apartment together, we even had a stray cat we found together and took care of. As time passed through I noticed her become more distant and spent more time with others and next to none with me. I’ll spare all the details but eventually things came to a head and she tried to leave while I was asleep I had woken up though and pleaded with her to stay and explain what was wrong as she wasn’t willing to and eventually I just let her leave and she promised she would come back after we had some time apart. 3 days later I got a text from her telling me it was over and that I had four hours to leave. With the help of my ex and now best friend funnily enough she helped me pull it together and get out with my cat as well. As we were leaving she showed up with cops in tow I guess to make sure I left and we haven’t spoken since. Afterwards she went around telling my friends and others I was abusive and my “friends” weren’t my friends anymore after that though some saw through it but not many.

Now here I am a year later I patched things up with my family and am staying with my grandparents until I’m able to be self sufficient. To be honest though I don’t know how to do that my trust in both myself and others is still utterly shattered and I now avoid the very things I also desire companionship of any kind. I still miss my ex despite also hating her in a way and nowadays I just feel stuck wanting to die but not being able to because of the family and very few friends I have left. I’m just not really sure what to do with myself anymore and while I’m going to a therapist at the behest of my father starting Wednesday I’m so scared it won’t help. I don’t want to be alone in life but now people just scare me if someone anyone could just tell me how I’m supposed to get through this and rid myself of my pain and fears I would be in your debt.";BitMitter

This is more of a rant using a throwaway account. Feel free, seriously, not to reply or anything. Some family know my regular username, and some friends, hence the need. I just need a vent, really. 

I've lost... ah, fuck it. So much. Like, not in comparison to some people, either or this sub (I'm sure), or those not living in currently sunny London, but instead in some war-torn area, but... well, it's loss to me, so it hurts. 

Former career? Gone. Taken from me by my family, after I'd spent years of my life working toward it and thousands of pounds on it. That really hurts. Now I've settled for... 4th best? 

Former promising sporting venture? Gone. Got injured. Never recovered fully. Now will never recover. Take care of your joints, people. It sounds petty but I was having a blast, and now there is 0% chance I will ever get to compete and be able at my former level. It was my go to, after my former career fell through. It sounds stupid, I know, but I really liked it, and it gave me something. 

Living in some shitty room with no space, all the while my two parents and two step-parents sit pretty with big houses, and my two siblings are more than well cared for and sorted for the future. I expect nothing financially, for the record, but they damned well know I have nowt from all I spent on my former career. To the tune of £20,000. If I had that back, I could help myself. 

Grandad died recently. I watched it happen. Heart failure. Tell you what, there's not much worse than watching a frail 95-year-old gasping for air every two mins because his heart is barely able to sustain life. I cried once, but only a little. To be honest, losing him (despite us being more father/son than I am with my actual dad) was just another kick to the curb, which I just accepted as my lot. I was beyond sadness, though. I even called him (we spoke twice a week on the phone about random crap, usually) after his death twice  out of habit, only to be greeted by a voicemail and the remembering that grandad weren't alive anymore. 

Her funeral was shit too. I sat there playing umpire whilst my mum and to-be husband got sniped at by my highly bully like and petulant step-father. Truth be told, I nearly decked him. Wish I had.

And the final kicker? I lost the love of my life some time ago, to this shitty disease called depression. No getting her back. She's gone. 

That's all led to me not feeling my best, I won't lie. I wouldn't mind, but the only thing I really want is to start repairing each bit. I've started, to be fair, but the one thing I can't do is form relationships. It's like that part of my brain has just shut down completely. I've pushed away two genuinely great women because we got close and I didn't know how to deal with that emotion anymore. 

So yeah... rant over. Job. Sport/other job. Relationships (or the now lack of them). Family. It's gone well!";throwaway768305

I am 16 years old and when the new year started I had the feeling that everything will get better this year because in the last one happened a lot of bad stuff. And for the first few months it really got better: I made new friends and I also met a girl I fell in love with (I will mention her later in this story). But since around the start if march things went down so fast that I could start crying again. It all started with a party, where I and the mentioned girl slept in the same bed together (no we hadn't any sexual contact) and we cuddled and the next morning was the best moment I had in my entire life. But after a few days when I asked her if we are a couple noe she answered that she has some problems in the moment and that she still is very unsure how much she likes me. And that is okay for me because I can't and won't blame her for her feelings and she also had a very hard year 2018. But since then some I call them ""dark thoughts"" took place in my head that say, that she doesn't like me, that I am just an annoying piece of sh*t and so on. When I told her that (a good friend of mine suggested that after I wrote about that with him) she said that she is very sorry that she dragged me into her problems and that she doesn't know how to help me, but that she will help me if I need it. But these ""dark thoughts"" don't stop at only the topic of love but also show me something like a bad or maybe real version of myself. The more days pass, the stronger I feel lonely (even if I know that there are people that care about me), useless because I don't have any talents that are important for a future job, broken, left behind, forsaken, lost. But all that reached a new level last week when i had something like a panic attack, where this ""dark thoughts"" nearly screamed that I should cut myself and all these things I explained before. I was able to resist this desire under tears. But it left me more broken and desperate. I talked with my best friends about that (also my crush) and my crush gave me some advices how to deal with a panic attack. But I can't say if they'll help next time because there isn't passing a day without thoughts about cutting myself or just ending it all. I even made plans on how I would kill myself but I think I wouldn't do that in the next time because there is something like a last hope inside me. But most time I just feel empty because of doing nothing because even the tiniest thing I have to do produces an extreme high amount of stress. And I don't know if I could tell my parents because I think I don't want to get any ""professional help"" from a doctor or something because I would just feel more like a freak who's unable to live a normal life. Also something awful is that I feel like I don't have any talents even if I am doing Kempo (a traditional japanese martial art without hard body contact and I have the first black belt in this) because sometimes I am unable to give 100% of my power and I never had something like this before. And when a friend of mine does something awesome, cool or better than me I start to feel like crap and uninteresting because it seems that I don't achieve anything. For example when a friend makes a cool comment in class or just do something and getting attention and acclaim for it. The only time I don't feel like that is when I do something funny with my friends or when I have ti give some Kempo lessons for the kids group that I have to teach because the kids make me happy with their power, enthusiasm and happiness and I also can't and don't want to be a bad role model for them. But when I am in school again for example I start to feel crappy again. These thoughts about hurting myself torture me and I don't know how long I can resist this horrible desire. I don't know if you can call this depression and would it help me to know that? I don't think so but it definitely is a big problem for me. If you read this I hope you're doing better and I want to thank you for paying attention.

Edit: Also when my friends say that they will care about me and love me I feel bad in a few hours.";TheGreatestYee

I apologize if this post is long, and ambiguous.  I just slowly feel losing myself and I keep feeling like something is stuck in my heart, and I keep looking into the wall and spacing out.

&#x200B;

During highschool, I was very motivated, positive, and a happy individual.  I would say my key strength was how decisive I was. My parents were always out of house working, and I was always left alone with videogames. I grew fond of them and how intricate some of them were. My brother went off to college and I was alone until 9pm on some days. I never resented my parents for negligence since I knew they were working for the well being of the family.

&#x200B;

College came, I decided to try Comp. Sci like my brother did. He was already done with college and had landed a few internships. I thought to myself: There is nothing a human can do if the person is determined and put his mind to it. I ended the semester with a B+ in Comp. Sci. I was happy.

&#x200B;

Second semester came and I got obliterated by the second level Comp Sci course. The TA hours overlapped with my English course. I didn't go to any english courses and focused on Comp Sci. It wasn't going well. I decided that If I struggle in 2nd level course, the higher I went the more I would suffer. Besides, I didn't even learn anything myself..I did everything I could to get help. I befriended nerds, played games with them, ate lunch with them to get all the help I needed to pass the weekly projects. I wasn't happy. I withdrew from the Semester since I had failed English and had gotten something like a D on comp sci.

&#x200B;

I took a break for 6 months, working in Dunkin / Starbucks to find out what I liked. I didn't find out, and decided to try Math since I was confident in my math skills.

&#x200B;

I went back to college, first semester went fine, then second semester I got shit on again. I currently withdrew and I am home now.

&#x200B;

I coped with video games when things were hard. It helped me occupy my mind and I passionately liked, and still like video games to this day. I could go on for more than 10 hours, even 24 hours if I really wanted to.

&#x200B;

I am searching for my third major now. I am sad, and dissapointed in myself at how I couldn't get anywhere when people around my age are graduating or are heading for their senior year in college. My family decided to move my computer to living room so I could study and get a real estate salesperson license. They are restricting me from video games. I don't even know what it is, but over the years I became less confident, less decisive, and my head got fucked. I don't even know what the point of writing this is. The past months have been the worst since I failed, I made my parents waste money on me, my father had a stroke (he is okay now but it was a painful experience), things with my girlfriend have been tough, and more. 

&#x200B;

I think I cling onto video games since it gives me a sense of achieving something. I compete at the very highest level, and every decision I make in game that leads me to victory gives me satisfaction. Now that I can't play games, maybe I am feeling down for not being able to escape my continuous failures in life.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend's dog is also dying and I need to be there for her. But I end up feeling worse for trying to make her feel better and feel worthless. I usually end up staring into the wall and not being able to think anything. By that I mean I try to think something, but  I can't because I don't know where to begin or what to think.

She said she remembers this guy called ""Harry"" (shortened version of my name) and she described having a whole life extremely similar to what me n her had planned together, my theory is it was some kind of weird trauma dream where she dreamed about our life.

45;Girlfriend has depression;1;bie9hz;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bie9hz/girlfriend_has_depression/;0;2019-04-28 15:24:50;"So here goes nothing, I’ve tried a lot of things but have frayed away from social media until now. I’m seeking advice. 

My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years has seeking depression and anxiety. We live together and are fairly young too, (20, 21). I work full time for a large company, go to college part time, and I’m working to start a business of my own. She works part time at 2 companies (maybe 30 hours or less a week), does not go to college and complains all the time about how tired she is. Needless to say, I pay all of my bills and some of hers too because she doesn’t make much money. 

Her depression isn’t without reason, she knows it frustrates me that she can’t hold a good job, pay her own bills, and help with rent.  She also has put on weight recently and is very upset with her own body even though I tell her I love her body everyday. She also does not have close family near where we live (even though she’s not really close with anyone in her family). It’s basically her, me, and my family where we live. 

What really bothers me the most is it feels like she’s taking advantage of me. It always seems that I’m doing the house work, I’m cooking, I’m paying for everything while she barely does any of that. If I say something about it, she breaks down and gets mad and doesn’t talk to me. 

The thing is, I’m compassionate. I get the spot she’s in. She doesn’t like her jobs and she barely has money. But to any reasonable person, the answer to that is to either find a better job and or work more. But she doesn’t do that, she just complains. This takes a toll on me because in my eyes, she has it easy and it when I address this to her, again she blames her depression.

I’ve researched depression quite a bit since dating her, i understand it’s an illness and it has to be treated. By no means do I think she’s lying to me when she tells me that everything she is doing or isn’t doing is because she’s so depressed. 

I’ve talked to her about getting help and her physician knows and has given her medicine but it doesn’t help. I asked her to make an appt with a psychiatrist but she doesn’t want to do that claiming that “she won’t have the motivation to go”. I’d take her myself if I wasn’t so busy all the time. 

I don’t do this often but I’m seeking advice and wisdom from fellow Reddit users. I feel stuck, she’s far away from her family, we have a dog, an apartment together and I haven’t been happy lately. I would be happier if I didn’t have to worry about her as much. If she paid her own bills and helped me with joining expenses like rent and groceries. I would be happier if she was happier.

Of course this might be because school is about to end and last essays etc. are piling up. But it feels like I am ''falling back to my old life'' and I'm not sure if this is temporary or not. 

Any advice?

It's a long post so would really appreciate it. It might be long since I tend to go off topic easily. 

I always have negative thoughts about myself and my future in my head. It all started in 2017 when I had the worst possible year I could have. My last year in high school ended up with me failing in math which forced me to drop for a year and sit at home and do nothing but prepare for the retest again next year. Sitting at home for a whole year depressed me to the point where I literally became emotionless. Nothing seemed to make me happy or sad and everything was just ""meh"". 

I thought I'd end up taking some courses but and was excited too. But only for a while. Blame - sitting at home. I'd stay up late at night, sometimes up till 5/6 in morning doing nothing but just scrolling through social media and YouTube. I had no friends in my city too. I did have a couple in school. One was my classmate and best friend. And one was a friend younger than me. They both did try to help me but them not being physically present didn't do much. And at the end I stopped telling them about my feelings. My retest came in March last year and results came in May. I cleared. Was a little happy. Only because I FINALLY cleared high school..

Got enrolled to a college in June and started in July. The first month went normally and wasn't really exciting except for the new college feel. The first week I got to know I won't get good friends whom I could trust upon. We had a ""bridge course"" in the first month. It was nothing study related. Just that we could get used to college life. On the last day of the bridge course, I met a girl in my class. We exchanged numbers because I had to send her pics of our class and a professor teaching it for our bridge course report. We start talking and now we've been in a relationship for 7 months. 

All this time I was literally an open book to her telling everything about myself and my past and all. And it did kinda help me. But after a while, even that stopped. It felt like no matter who I talked to, nothing would help. I've started hiding my emotions and thoughts a lot more now for the past month or so since I've ever did. I keep most things to myself and let little out. I don't want to continue like this and end up ruining my college life and my potential career. 

I really don't know what to do.";coal_ector
52;I'm in a stage where I just want to smoke weed and play video games but my brain knows that this is not possible. I think I need some help or advice.;1;bie006;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bie006/im_in_a_stage_where_i_just_want_to_smoke_weed_and/;0;2019-04-28 15:00:30;"I just felt the need to talk to someone so here it goes.


I was born and raised in the country. My parents were working all day long until the sun came down and it was time for bed. I'm from the Balkans and a lot of the families here were/are poor by default and mine was no exception. I was never needy but shame is a feeling you can't escape from when you are the poor kid in school. This had an effect on my education as well and I barely made it through school. When it was almost over I realized that I fucked up and that I will probably be working in some low-budget restaurants for the rest of my life.


The lucky circumstance in my fucked up life is that I could watch TV all day and a local TV station was broadcasting CartoonNetwork where I learned the English language on my own. This encouraged me to seek online jobs and eventually I got into marketing. It was fantastic for a year, I learned a ton of new stuff and was making more money than anyone I know. I even started helping my parents with some cash that I could spare. This was the peak of my life, financially and morally. Everything I wanted as a kid was available and affordable but I later figured out that money can't keep you happy very long.


About a year ago I realized that I hate my job. No one told me that moral and marketing don't go along very well so I started weeding out my clients. I kept the ones that were selling useful products and stopped working for the other guys. This had an impact on my financial situation and I moved to a smaller apartment but nothing changed. My depression was developing fast and I was aware of it but there isn't anyone you could talk to. People here are very conservative and as soon as you tell them that you might be feeling depressed they tell you to fuck off, get a beer or pop some pills. The therapsts aren't helpful as well. I had a long chat with a lovely lady a few months back and she was amazed that I am aware of all this stuff but can't get through my depression. I don't blame her for prescribing pills but they aren't working. The people I hang out with are also very conservative and can't understand how someone who makes 5-10 times more than they do can even think about depression. So I'm now left with 3 close friends that understand me to some extent. One of them is with me every single day and most of the time we just smoke some weed and play video games. Those are the only two things that can still make me happy and trust me, I have tried everything. From going out to making parties at my place. I just don't feel relaxed around people and I also think that could be my anxiety slowly developing as well.

I am sorry for this long post but I had to let it all out. Right now, I am one rent behind and slacking at work as much as I can. Just 10 minutes before I decided to post here I was trying to work on a marketing campaign but I just can't. It feels so meaningless, hard, annoying... I can't explain it but you are probably familiar with the feeling.


If there is anything that you think would help please share it in the comments. So far I have tried the things I mentioned above along with exercise, yoga and meditation. As a temporary solutions there were helpful but nothing lasts more than a few hours. After that I'm back to thinking about the meaning of life and is it actually worth it.";calderh18

He said ""you can't just keep sitting around and feeling sorry for yourself and waiting for things to get better. At the end of the day, you've got to do it for yourself because in this world, no one's going to help you."" He said other things too but, now he said it I'm already doing what I can to improve my life. I've been stuck at a bump for god knows how long but now I want to change that. I never listened to people's advice and I've been letting down others, and now I want to do it for them and myself, because happiness is a reward that is ridiculoisly hard to get, but is worth it. Because the days where I'm sitting around, doing nothing, are the days that I'm letting myself down. Everytime I wake up late, I'm letting myself down. Everytime I don't leave the house, again, I'm letting myself down. It's going to be really fucking hard to kick it. And it's remarkable because for the past few weeks I'd been planning to top myself. I've tried to before and I regret it. The last time I spent a week in hospital. There's nothing more lonely than being in a hospital bed after trying to kill yourself. And now I fucking promise myself, anything I want is achievable, but it isn't gonna happen waiting for others to do it for me. Life isn't worth giving up on. We all fucking die one day, and there are many bad things to come that we don't know of, and the best days of our lives too.

I’ve been going through a lot recently. My father died a few days ago. My depression keeps getting worse and worse. And I’m so burnt out in terms of school. My family is in shambles and has little to no money. So the thing is, I had an interview yesterday for a scholarship. The interview went extremely bad. I’ve done about 5 interviews thus far and none of them went like this. There were about 7 or 8 people interviewing me—the most I’ve ever had—and they were all male. I’m a guy myself but just so you guys understand, I’ve only had female interviewers and 1 male interviewer in the past. So it was kinda like new territory for me. I only mention this because my prior interviewers seemed much more easy going. The group of guys that interviewed me were pretty old for the most part and seemed a bit up tight. Anyway though, the interview went horrible. My mind went blank and I felt I wasn’t prepared. Part of that is my fault especially because I didn’t do much preparation. I hate to make any excuse because I do recognize that it was my fault and responsibility, but with my dad, depression, school work and all, I felt that I had so much weighing on my mind and couldn’t really focus on the questions being asked. Also, I have social anxiety so there’s that. It was very traumatizing for me. It almost felt like they were feeding me backhanded compliments and they didn’t seem impressed. They didn’t like me. I was noticeably nervous.  They looked at me like their shit didn’t stink and that something terribly different about me. I probably won’t get the scholarship truthfully. Also, I guaranteed my school counselor hyped me up so I can even have the opportunity to get this scholarship and I don’t want to disappoint her. The interview went so bad that it made my depression worse. I was even considering suicide again yesterday after day, especially with the build up of things I got going on. I’m depressed about many things and one of that things is feeling lonely and not really having anyone that likes me. Sure it’s hard for me to express what’s going on due to my social anxiety and all that, but I always felt no one liked/likes me. I could really use some encouraging words. I keep replaying the interview in my head and I don’t know how to face my counselor tmrw. If you guys need more details, feel free to ask. Thanks for reading this far. Also, if it sounds like I’m making a bunch of bs excuses please say so. Honesty and advice is all I’m looking for. Thanks again!;aceanime
59;It's one of those days.;2;bidtv2;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bidtv2/its_one_of_those_days/;1;2019-04-28 14:44:55;"I woke up today in that shitty stint where you feel like the world is against you, everything's going to fall apart, and it's not even worth it to take care of yourself. You live with other people, so you go through the motions rather than staying in bed all day or crying for a while, you don't let on how much you're hurting on the inside because they wouldn't get it, or they'd think it could be fixed with an ""I'm here for you"" and a hug then get confused or frustrated when that doesn't work. You don't want to reach out, because the few friends you have you feel like you lean on all the time and they're getting sick of you and will find better friends to spend time with if you keep your shit up. You don't want to talk to anyone about it, because someone ALWAYS has it worse, and even though people SAY that's not an excuse to trod down on someone else's sadness.. that's exactly what they do with it. People ""don't get how you're depressed"" because you have a roof over your head, family that aren't dead or drug addicts, and food on the table, and it just ""doesn't make sense,"" so you stop bothering to tell them and just pretend you're fine. You feel like you're broken in a way no one can fix, yet sometimes you try and fix it with the stupidest things, like throwing food, exercise, being selfless for others instead, whatever hobbies at it, then feel guilty for overindulging in those things and realize it didn't even work.  


That was kind of a stream of consciousness and I'm sorry, but it's hard today. My birthday's coming up soon, and while my mom is kind enough to be trying to organize something even though we're low on money and it's not a ""big"" birthday, I'm just crushed by the awareness that if she didn't do that, no one would give a shit or even know. Last year nobody remembered other than my mom, and my dad probably because she told him. We have a very close-knit extended family, EVERYONE remembers everyone, everyone likes to schedule lunches or get-togethers for everyone's birthday, but when I was alone at a shitty college dorm with a roommate whose friends kept ripping me off and inconveniencing me, only weeks after my grandma (see: light of my life, visited her almost weekly when I could) had died and I had nobody, nobody even bothered to remember. Now I know it was probably my grandma reminding everyone, that no one actually cared, I'm just forgettable. A nothing. Just someone people tolerate and invite to family events because it'd be socially impolite if they didn't, since I'm technically related and all.  


I feel like a disappointment to the few people who actually bothered to put any stock in me, so I basically just reassured them that the others who disregard me and ignore me did right. My mom tells me all the time ""how highly people talk of me"" in the family, but I know that's a lie when I'm just some pathetic college kid barely passing classes who does nothing but grind through work, whine about the work, and then waste my parents' money on an education I don't deserve. I feel like everything is a waste. I was ""fine"" yesterday, or at least I didn't let the thoughts take me over like this, and I don't know why I can't be ""fine"" today. Even if it's fake fine, I'd rather be fake fine for a while than deal with this shit over and over. I just hate myself, I hate all the decisions I make, and I feel like there's NO ONE in my life that's better for having known me (other than maybe a ""Well at least I didn't end up like cyclothymicfirefly haha"" way.)";cyclothymicfirefly

Anyway, I'm going through a tough time and that IME often leads to feelings of depression: not ""being sad,"" but more like being emotionally deadened or muffled, as well as being emotionally fine... and then suddenly incredibly irritable or angry, like Hulk-smash angry, though I'm able to control the smashy part of that at least.

I've also noticed that I tear up really easily, and not in response to any stimuli. Just all of a sudden my eyes tear up, it can be difficult to see, etc. I'm not ""crying"" in that there's no emotional component, and no feeling of release, just kind of leaking from my eyes I guess?

So my questions are, first, are these kinds of symptoms -- emotionally muffled, sudden bursts of irritability, and excessive tears -- typical for depression? \*Is\* there a ""typical""? 

And at what point do I stop just toughing this out (that's what I've always done, knowing the time would pass, etc.) and seek mental health help?

I’m about to start university and recently went to a psychiatrist hoping to get medication for my ADHD to help me focus on school, but the psychiatrist said that most people are usually able to manage their ADHD by the time they reach adulthood. 

She added that the lack of focus, being easily distracted and inability to stick to routines is a symptom of depression (I do have depression and infrequent suicidal thoughts but I’ve been “okay” lately) so she wanted to treat that instead and put me on Fluvoxamine. It’s also supposed to help me sleep better, and I know this may be entirely too early to tell as it’s only the third day, but I still haven’t been able to sleep at night. I feel the same, no energy to interact with people but not actively suicidal either. I’ve googled and it says it’ll take about 8-12 weeks for the antidepressants to take effect. 

What happens then? Those who are on antidepressants, how do you feel? Do they work? Do they make you happier/look forward to living? Do they give you energy? Does it help with focus and concentration? Or are there still days where despite taking them you still feel like you’re better off dead?

I’m disappointed I didn’t get ADHD medication to help me focus in school, but if antidepressants can make me feel “normal” again then I’m excited to see how it goes.";disapppearance

A few years ago I was in a car accident and was in the hospital for a week and he stayed with me every moment sleeping on the chairs in my room. We have gone on month long backpacking trips and have learned to work together as a team.  He used to be an avid sci-fi reader, he used to build these huge RC cars and he was into kites and philosophy and cars ( he has a beautiful little Datsun sport that was once loved and taken care of is now peeling from the sun and cobwebbed and has mold inside :\[ )He was also so upbeat! Optimism poured out of this man like a fountain. But now...?

&#x200B;

He cries maybe 2-7 days out of the week, like epic cries that leave him exhausted. He has insomnia and bearly sleeps and so just lies in bed for 14 hours, and then he feels bad lying in bed all day which makes him more miserable. He has started smoking a LOT of pot, he claims it helps but when he started smoking pot I never notices these sad behaviors. He says mean things to me, and tells me that he's depressed because of me...that even when I don't say anything, he can just FEEL me judging him. He avoids his family like the plague ( which is hard cuz he lives at home ). He refuses to see a therapist, he refuses to get help. He has 20 more weeks total of university before he gets a BA in physics but I fear he wont make it.

&#x200B;

I am afraid to wake him up ( I also live with his family, also in university for a BioChem major. ) He is either mean to me or he will start crying when I wake him up. I try to wake him up with kisses and snuggles and he bats me away, the other day I did not wake him up and he slept till 7:30pm and he said he was mad that I didn't wake him up and he wished I could be more assertive.

I have been working and saving money for such a long time. I have been paying for him almost since we met. I bought his car, I pay for  his insurance, I payed for his classes ( after he failed to fill out the college money aid form) I buy all of the food he eats, I bought all of his clothes the last 4 years, I'm INVESTING in him because I believe in him and I want him to succeed. I try my best to listen when he complains and I try my best not to argue. He says hurtful things though like I'm too fat ( I have a normal bmi) and that its my fault he's depressed. I will say "" what am I doing to make you depressed? , I will stop"" and he gets frustrated and claims that I'm starting ANOTHER argument with him. Like, what? no, I asked what I was doing wrong- and he will cut me off and say that I just don't get it, I just don't understand. and if I push harder he will get up and leave and not talk to me.

these times always makes me cry. what happened? We have been together for so long, why is he acting like this? why now? what's changed?  I suggest therapy and he refuses, I suggest medication and he gets panicked and angry. I suggest a walk and he says "" no...I have to study"" and then lies down in bed. I try to get him up and he bats me away and says mean things to me.

&#x200B;

I have started seeing a therapist for myself about 4 months ago which I admit is helping a little, shes someone to vent to, and we are working on not letting him get to me so much.

I read articles about depression and they say to be supportive but I don't know how? I try to support him but I cant win when he says "" I FEEL you judge me"". I have tried many things after he says this ( he says it often) and they always end up with him upset. He even gets upset when I leave, I tell him that I have to use the restroom or anything to get away without hurting him but he will say "" your just leaving because you are disappointed in me..."" 

wth?? hes never said things like this before, what happened???

This is also taking a toll on me and my own schooling. We both commute 3 hour round trip / day for  school (we do go to different schools but our schools are almost next to each other) and we are both taking really heavy classes. I WANT to join a club and I WANT to volunteer and I WANT to get an internship but he argues that I shouldn't and he gets upset when I talk about them. Then he talks about how he's probably going to fail school. I am missing out in my schooling to avoid making him worse.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do. every day I keep trying. I love him and I'm not looking for anyone to tell me to leave him, please none of that. I am just looking for ideas on how to help.

When I kiss him awake and he bats me away, was that the right thing to do? should I have left him to oversleep? should I keep pushing him to study and do well?

He has told me that, even me suggesting things put him off, should I suggest him to sleep in? 

Therapy is out the window, he will leave the room if I mention the word. This morning I tried to cuddle him and he pushed me away ( he cuddles me all the time though, I just cant cuddle him), should I have pushed me cuddling him? Should I continue pushing him even when he fights back? or should I step back and let him oversleep, miss doing homework, let him feel bad about himself?";honeymyhoney

I haven’t had any issues for several years. I started to notice a few months ago my temper getting shorter, and bursts of anger. Then horrific anxiety that is just nonstop. I started taking Prozac again, and I have an appointment with behavioral therapy next week.

I’ve been taken the Prozac for barely a week. I’m trying to give it a few weeks, but this is horrible. It is taking so long to work, and I feel horrible. At times I can feel it starting or attempting to level out my moods, but what I am feeling intense.

I am someone that isn’t very emotional, I am very logical, and don’t care what other people think. Now, I am paranoid and even bearing the phone ring gives me a panic attack. I even accused my husband of cheating even though I know that isn’t what he is doing or would do. 

I apologized to him about it since I knew it wasn’t the case, but I feel like shit since I can’t control my damn emotions, outbursts, crying spells.. I am overthinking everything, and extremely paranoid. 

I feel like people are looking at me strangely, I dropped two classs I was taking since I can’t concentrate or remember anything. I can see if behavorial therapy will give me an off work order until it mellows out

The pain is just nonstop, and now I’m starting to get insomnia. It’s just that weird achy feeling in your chest, paranoia, crying frequently, it just doesn’t stop.

I do have some stress in my life, but I feel like these issues just won’t go away. I’ve done mediation, relaxation techniques but my body is constantly in fight or flight mode, especially the last two days. 😑. I am worried that Behavorial Therapy won’t be able to help me, and that this pain will be here for the rest of my life. 

I hate it. I’m an independent person, and I have to be reminded to eat something, I feel helpless. I love taking a showering in the morning to wake me up, or when I get off work as a way to relax, and now I’m getting panic attacks over going to take a damn shower.
 
It is so dumb that it is taking me hours to do certain things. It just keeps hitting me over and over and over. I try to push it away, and it basically says NOPE then there’s more crying and emotional outbursts.

I’ve only been taking the Prozac a week at 20mg... so I’m thinking a lot of this is just me (as I’ve experienced this before taking it but not as intense).. and it’s trying to work.

I’m just so tired. I want to be like everyone else,  normal. I want to not start crying uncontrollably for an hour, I would like to eat without feeling like throwing up.. I just want this lump in my throat and heaviness in my chest to go away. 

I’m starting to get insomnia... I’ll have to wait until Wednesday to see a therapist, and possibly call my doctor and see if I can have the next week days off.

I hate this. I hate feeling so vulnerable, and helpless. I know that my thoughts are not logical.. and that my behavior and emotions are insane right now.. but I can’t even control it and it’s frustrating.

Sometimes I feel myself drifting off just staring off, I’m even starting to question if everything is real, this just feels like a dream.

It just won’t stop.";Artemisgalan

My dad is an alcoholic, he drinks almost every night until now. my mom i think is depressed too.

Hi (Name).  I hope you are all ok.  

I'm depressed (Name).

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/clinical-depression/symptoms/

I haven't felt this depressed in nearly 10yrs.  I've got most of the symptoms.  It's definitely moderate on the scale.  I've felt like this for about a week.  

I started crying twice at church on Sunday evening while talking to (name) after the service.

Since the depression has come on the back of a feeling I had when I  prayed with (name, it was the pastor I was praying with.  And over the last 10 weeks, I have updated him regularly on my experience) at mine 2 months back.  I fear the depression is here to stay.  

I've told my mum, and she is being supportive.  

And today I rang the (place) Mental Health Team at (place) to ask for an appointment to see my Psychiatrist.  They are going to send me an appointment in the post.

Obviously I'm worried, at what the future holds for me.  But not to much.  And at the moment I'm ok in it all.  

I just hope the depression doesn't become severe.

Thanks for reading.

This descent into moderate depression has taken place over the last 8 weeks.

No fucking response!   No fucking response.  The two other people I text that day to explain my situation.  Responded within minutes, minutes!  Because they obviously care about me!

Look I know something serious could have happened.  But I would surely have been told by now.  Yes I know he could have forgotten.  I've factored that all in.

But four fuckin days!!!!!!  This is emblematic of the man/pastor!  

I'm pretty pissed about this!

And no, I'm not fuckin chasing after him!  I've done to much of that already!

People just don't fuckin care!  Enough to show due diligence with those that they seem to pretend to care about/for!

I dont know why. How do i let go? Shes a nice person and honestly shes the only person talking to has ever helped my depression. I feel so desperate for her to care. But i know she has no reason to. I still write her and cant let go. I want to but when im in the depth of despair i reach out still knowing she doesnt want to know. Any time ive tried to talk to other girls they never measure up to her. I cant even feign interest in them. Its not fair to them either, but they just arent her. I feel id rather be dead than keep going thru this cycle. Im so fkin miserable. I dont know who can help. Im on meds, been to therapy many times, etc”


The comments are always the same. “Leave her alone, respect her wishes etc, go to therapy”. These are things i KNOW. You arent telling me anything i dont know or tried to do. I  try. Ive been in therapy many times, im on meds. I try to leave her alone . I do, but when im depressed and nothing else helps i write her. I shouldnt but most of you should knlw how desperate and lonely depression makes you. I mean i dont wanna disrespect her wishes by contacting her but the. Again she disrespects mine by not helping, so why is it more important not to disrespect hers? I only want a friend.

I KNOW i need to let go. I KNOW that. I mean why do you think im asking for advice? And whenever i follow up saying “well i know that so what advice do you have to stop” nobody ever wants to follow up.like they white knight for her but have no care or consideration how i feel. 

You ever heard the song pumped up kicks? Thats how i feel sometimes. I have so much anger towards society and how shallow it is, how nobody cares. I sometimes get very dark thoughts. Id never act on them but i dont even want to have them. But its hard when most people in society see, so shitty. Even on boards like these were people are supposed to offer advice l

You can judge me if you want but i KNOW i need to leave her alone. The impulse when im down is too strong sometimes. I feel like killing myself. Is that the only thing i can do now? I dont know. I feel out of other options. Im not a bad person i dont think, i need to figure out how to get past this. I dont know how.

Please if youre gonna give advice, actually help and give me some and how to change, not things ive heard and know already, thats not helping. If i didnt see it as a problem i wouldnt be trying to chanfe it";DyslexicSantaist

I've depressed for the majority of my life. I guess it started when I was around 11/12. I'm 21 one, so for the longest time I lived with it. It was such a huge part of my life, that I imagined my future as ""still being unemployed or working a terrible job I hate that gives 0 money, gf left me etc."" I had this really bad future in my head for almost all the time and in the past few weeks a lot of things changed.

For instance, I managed to put a foot into the newspaper industry. Just a short internship, but I already had an interview with the boss and everything seems like I'd get the job. It's fun, I like the colleagues, it pays good. Sure it's a lot of work, but I'm genuinely interested. For my entire life we've been poor, never had enough money. And now? It seems like there might be a chance to get out of it! It seems like my entire future might change, from me being able to move together with my gf, to finally having some money. And I'm so terrified of it. My brain feels like it's been deep fried, I can't handle all this ""everything will probably be ok""! And I know I should be happy about it... But I just can't. I have the urge to ruin it again, just so I can fulfill my dumb ass views on my future. No, I know I won't say no to the job offer IF I get it, but otherwise... Everything seems so damn scary to me. I get a lot of panic attacks lately about it. Dunno. Has anyone ever felt that? What did you do to cope with it?";Askaram

Yuhu!!! I don’t know how it is not to be depressed.  I harmed myself again, with 30. Wtf??? When will this stop? The last time I did it I was a teenager. 

Long story short: 
I know my therapist will tell me to take antidepressants, but I don’t trust pills!
I don’t want to stop drinking, I don’t want to stop smoking weed and all other fun things. 
But I can’t take those pills without stopping all those fun stuff and I can’t stop believing that pharmacy is just making money with our diagnosis. 
I tried antidepressants twice and I had so many side effects that I had to stop.

what is your experience with it? Did it help? How many different kinds did you have try out before you found the “right” one? 
Is there a “right” one? Or is it a big lie - as I believe it is?

Now I hate my stepmother, she basically cheated on my dad and she's mentally and verbally abused me and casually bounced it off onto depression. So because of her I moved out of my dad's, I rarely get to see him and she treats him like shit which pisses me off the most  among other things.

Its recently been a 2 week break off school and in that time I've mainly been watching shows gaming woodworking, mountain biking just to keep myself distracted. Some nights I cry from anger when I'm going to sleep because I can't think of anything else.
Keep in mind this is a short summary of what that bitch has done.

So the other night I couldn't get to sleep so I watched a TV show until about 3, that's when I decided to try and sleep. I went up stairs and hopped in my bed and just suddenly felt super angry, I just lay there for ages. I got up and it felt as if I was in a passenger seat. I walked downstairs and turned a light on and walked over to the tool box crying (it always happens when  I get extremely angry but it's not sad its idk angry) and I just looked at the toolbox trying to find a hammer. And I couldn't find one.  My mum and her partner (who is a woman) came out of their room and we talked and I felt like I wanted to just tear my cheating stepmom limb from limb.

Idk what to do, I'm scared of what will happen if I get this angry again cus it'll ruin my life.";surobutox

I just sat with them as they were talking, unable to join the conversation or show any reaction at all. That classmate's grandfather died a few days ago. I couldn't even say ""sorry for your loss."" It's like there's a glass wall between me and everyone else, I feel detached from the world around me.  
A few days ago I took the exam to get my drivers licence. During that exam I made so many mistakes and nearly caused an accident, if my teacher hadn't intervened. Stupid mistakes that I still make after taking so many driving lessons. Far more than I have to take by law. Maybe I'm just not mentally able to drive a car. I'd just be a danger to myself and innocent people on the roads. Maybe it would be better for me to die so my family wouldn't have to deal with me being a failure any longer.  
Half a week ago I laughed at something funny that had happened. My mother said that it's so nice to hear me laughing like that. I didn't even realise until then how numb I had become. Detached from the life around me. I can't focus on reading anymore, I can't enjoy a good book like I used to. I used to love drawing but now I feel like I can't even hold a pencil properly. I've shut all these things out, even though I once enjoyed these activities.

I remember how it all started. I had never thought of harming myself or being worthless before, but that night I tried to choke myself. When I realised what I was doing all of those feelings came to the surface. They might have already been there before, maybe since I was a small child, but remained hidden in my subconscious. I don't have any reason to be feeling like that. Nothing bad or traumatizing happened in my childhood. But I still don't belong.

I'll have to go back to university tomorrow, but I don't see the point of studying to become something I don't want to be. I don't want to be anything. Life means nothing to me; the future means nothing to me. I'm not even sure how much my friends and family truly mean to me. Scanning through the text I've written it kind of sounds like a suicide note. Explaining why I don't want to be here. If only I could show this to my family, maybe they would understand. But they don't speak English and even if they did, words can only give them a slight idea of what this feels like. I can't describe my thoughts and feelings in a way that they'd understand. Even if they read these words, they won't exactly experience that feeling. Feel what I'm feeling and think what I'm thinking.

I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I know I will, but I don't want to. It's pointless. I don't belong. When my half sister died in december 2017 I prayed to a god I don't believe in that I could trade my life for hers. She had children, she had family, she had a reason and will to live. I don't. I wish I could just stop existing and erase everyone's memory of me so they wouldn't miss me or be hurt by my death.

I want to go to sleep again so I don't have to be awake. I think death is just like dreamless deep sleep, forever. That's a comforting thought. I'm tired almost all the time, even though I sleep twice as much as my friend does. Apparently his depression causes sleeplessness, mine hypersomnia.

I don't really expect anyone to read all of this, but if someone did: Thank you. I'm sorry it's such a chaotic and mixed up text. I just needed to get these random thoughts out of my head.";AsakalaSoul

Formatting sucks as I’m on mobile. Also I’m just tired and sick of everything so I don’t expect this to be easy to follow along. 

I’ve been to psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and doctors. No one wants to give me a diagnosis and if anything based on their notes in my journal they just seem to be thinking that I am over exaggerating. Yet I managed to get prescribed antidepressants (not that that’s any difficult nowadays). 

Zoloft didn’t work and made me just get awful headaches. Prozac stopped working after 3 months. Effexor (still on it) stopped working after 6 months. I’m on 150 mg right now but because I stopped feeling any better by taking it I just started skipping doses every now and again (yet I cannot go more than 3 days without it because of the withdrawal symptoms that are AWFUL). 

I’ve been selfharming for 8 years now, suicidal for 5 years and 2 attempts. Everyday feels forced. Like you’re being suffocated by your own life. Chest heavy and painful making you seriously wonder with each passing day if just stabbing yourself in the heart won’t be less painful. 

Sure, every now and again you might still have a good day... but what really is a good day when the rest of your life is a living nightmare? If everyday is like being drowned and pushed down by huge waves... then just one day without the waves might feel good but it doesn’t really change the fact that you’re drowning.  

How long can you keep on fighting? What’s the point? What are you even fighting for?

At this point I truly believe that some people are just born mistakes. Universal fuckups I guess. Born to fight pointless battles all their life. There is no end goal for them... nothing to be achieved... yet they will continue to struggle.  

I’m in law school... I hate it. I have no motivation... I can’t study, I can’t concentrate, all I want is to sleep and never wake up. I have a huge exam in a week and I know I need to get my shit together but I can’t bring myself to read more than a few sentences before just dropping the book and staring into nothingness again. What’s the point?

I see no future. My memories haunt me. My life suffocates me. I have nowhere else to turn for help. Medication doesn’t seem to be working on me. According to professionals my issues aren’t true... and they are probably right.. who am I to question a professional? I am probably just exaggerating. I’m a lazy piece of shit. Stupid. So many have it worse and here I am complaining...

I wish I could give my life to someone terminally ill instead. They would deserve it a thousand times more than me. Why waste life force on a mistake. Others could do so much more with it. Instead here I am rotting away in bed.

It's actually surprising how fast depression can really act.

There may be some days when you feel like you're doing okay but then again deep down you're fearful and you're always questioning yourself if you'll feel the same way tomorrow or next week.

Depression changes your perspective on life, things that use to be fun no longer feel that way. No matter how hard you try to do certain things you enjoy its only a matter of time before it no longer satisfies you. 

Depression pushes those closest to you away, it prevents you from seeing the love and life around you. It hurts you so bad to see those around you worrying and feeling sad because of you but there's just nothing that you can do to stop it.

Depression makes you feel a certain way, it's that feeling of not wanting to die but just not wanting to live.

Some days I wish that everything could return back to normal. Return back to a time where depression did not exist. I wish this not only for me but for those that feel the same way because DEPRESSION is just HORRIBLE.";TheHopeWarrior

I’m scared and not prepared, I’ve stopped even attempting homework all together and I’m being harassed by this group who keep commenting on me and Ola being lesbian (despite I’m Bi and she’s Pan) and I hate it. Ola also gets harassed in her science classes as she’s a set lower than me so I’m not with her. We’re planning on telling our form tutor but I still don’t want to go back. I know I’ll be depressed and I hate it. I especially don’t want to see the biology classroom again, as I wrote my first draft of a suicide note there. I know I’ll end up having a panic attack or mental breakdown or some form of depressing shit that will make people give me that look of disgust. No wonder I hate my life.;MiniBoiiii

I have NEVER been good at anything I've ever done in my life, not even videogames. I've never won a competition, I've never got a single ""above average"" grade, I've never been particularly good at socializing. I've always been either mediocre or below average, and I know that it will not change. 

This is the second year I won't give a single exam succesfully, while all my ""friends"" keep getting incredible results and give multiple exams a year while leading much better lives than mine.

There is not a single thing that I can do better than anyone else in the planet, I have nothing to talk about with anyone since my pathetic life consists of waking up, studying, playing videogames or editing the few gut-wrenchingly terrible pictures I take, and then sleeping.

So why go on? Why not spend 100€ for 2 tanks of Helium and everything I need to end my joke of an existence? My parents will be sad, obviously, but I'm starting to think that they will be more sad when they see me at 45 years of age, alone, without a job, living my own shit in a miniscule apartment THEY payed for.

I hate myself for having done this so much and i'm scared of telling my parents (or anyone). I know that they'll be disappointed and angry with me. They'll think i'm a failure. I shouldn't be struggling so much, my life has been perfectly okay and yet i've been having these thoughts and impulses for so long now that i don't even recognize myself without them. I should've said something four months ago when i started to feel bad again but i just can't bring myself to and i never used to say anything to them and it always turned out fine. It doesn't feel like it'll turn out fine this time though. I'm so scared of what they'll say to me if i tell them and i'm so scared of getting help and wanting to live again. The prospect of telling anyone that i'm struggling is so scary that i'd rather commit suicide than having to deal with the consequences and aftermath.

I hate the fact that i can't solve this on my own and that i need help. It makes me feel weak. I don't want anyone's pity. Beyond that though, i don't even know what i will do once i'm better. I've fucked up my life too much. I can't even graduate fucking high school for gods sake! Like how stupid am i. I feel so dumb and worthless. My life has no value and i add nothing to this world. I can't even apply my mind to something as simple as finishing the bare minimum of school required for a shit life, not a super shit life. I just can't see a future anymore, i've fucked everything up too badly and i don't know how to untangle it. Everything is just pushing me closer and closer to committing and i'm going to buy rope next week once i get paid. I think my time is running out and i'm not sure if i can stop myself.

My college plans were thrown out the window and now I’m studying something I hate because it was “convenient”. Gave up the only thing I actually enjoyed which was film and theatre but beginning to second guess if I was ever good at that either. 

I have almost no friends because of language barriers, and I just don’t feel compatible with even anyone.  

Even though I’m not antisocial, I just tend to suppress all the shit I’m feeling. But recently I’ve been shutting down more and more and just not wanting to talk about anything or to anyone. Even when my girlfriend asks if I’m okay I don’t even know what to reply and I just shrug or mumble “mhm”. 

I feel like I’m dumb when I’m around other people who are in college and striving for more ambitious things and I’m just settling for attending a programming boot camp because I don’t have any other options. 

I lay in bed till the afternoon because I couldn’t care less about any obligations even though they’re important.  


I’ve just been not caring. And I don’t see any point to anything. 

Seeing a therapist soon though, so I hope that helps. Because I just want to let it out and cry and I don’t even know what for.

I dropped out of college and am living with my mom and unemployed. Granted, it’s for me to get therapy and support for my mental illness, but it still sucks. I was in a career making excellent money, living with my fiancé and doing okay for a bit, until I spiraled. At this point in life I’m almost hopeless. My initial dream was to be a pilot. Aviation was my life. I threw that away completely after my first suicide attempt (in America you’re disqualified for a pilot’s license if you basically have any mental illness) and my closest friend who I idolize got his license and is already with a company to fly planes. It kills me every time he mentions it (and friend, if you’re reading this, please dont feel bad. I understand its your passion and still is mine. Feel free to continue talking about it) because it’s a failed dream. 

My next life goal is to be a police officer, however after lots of research I’ve figured out that a lot of departments don’t allow people with mental illness to become police officers which absolutely sucks. I understand the reasoning, but I know I’m strong enough to do it and it’s just not fair. It feels my life is destroyed by my illness. I have little hope for anything if my local department won’t accept me into the academy. I have nothing else I’m passionate about that I can make a career and I have absolutely no motivation to work anywhere else and I want to serve a purpose in life other than asking people if they want a fry and drink with that burger. I want to become a cop to save lives, and I’m not scared of death. If I die attempting to bring a criminal to justice, I’d be happier than if I died on my own doing. 

Sometimes I wonder how people are 25 and figuring their stuff out and I can’t even drag myself to the grocery store so I can eat. In my treatment I hear stories of people who overcome their illness and at one point I thought I could too. At this point I don’t. I can’t control my emotions no matter how hard I try. My medicine helps a little but they say to use coping skills. Every time I try I end up worse off because they don’t work. I feel like I’m unfixable. Most people can snap out of it enough to get better by seeing something or hearing something that changes things or find that one thing that helps them manage but nothing helps me. My brain is wired differently and none of that works and I feel like I’m the only one. I also feel like I’m doing something wrong because I usually am. 

I want to live. I want to feel better. I want to pursue my career. I want to marry my fiancé and have a family. But I feel like none of those things will happen because I’m not good enough. Every day I feel like I’m going further and further from the dream. I guess for now I’ll try to stick it out and do everything I can not to push those who love me away. They’re the reason I’m alive so I guess that’s a good thing.";flyingataildragger

Growing up it was my mother and my sister. My sister was very ill, so I didn't get a lot of attention. I acted out in school, sleeping through class, refusing to do work for attention and it worked. I was candy for several  counselors. Eventually, my dad came back, but due to some complications, the family remained separate, and I ended up living with him in an apartment for the next several years. My acting out in school lead me to the BASS program where I was grouped in with the bad kids in the school. It didn't do me any good. I grew to be paranoid and bipolar. I remember one of my high school friends getting a blood swollen eye from stealing his brothers weed. He told the teacher some kids jumped him in an alley way. I also remember another one of my friends who I admire. He always defended his friends, and he was a big kid. He challenged the jocks one night in the locker room, and I would have helped him in the fight, but it would be like a mouse getting in-between a couple lions. Lets just say none of these guys had a visible neck. I did manage to be the only one of my sibling to get through high school, even though I always felt very outcast. Even more to my supersize, even though my immediate family is poor, my dad tells me to look into a trust fund, and it turns out I can go to college.

&#x200B;

 I do a mental 180 degree turn. I turn in everything on time, I get all A's. I tell myself it is to prove people wrong. It's a community college, and I get into Phi Theta Kappa and had some good times. I worked a job while going there, where I met a woman. It was bad because it turned out to be a train wreck where an army deserter was found to be more desirable than me. I turned to self harm. I leave the community college after graduating and go to a higher end school.

&#x200B;

Even though I have forced this pursuit of excellence mentality on myself it is not enough. I have met some friends that do not have the same mentality as I. Failing is okay for them. If I fail a class, I am not covered, and I cannot rely on my family. My fathers health is failing, and my mother is just getting out of being homeless. I am the only one of my friends to not receive an internship. I am the only one at my school that I know of to not receive one. As far as I know, I don't do anything insulting, and when I look at the mirror it doesn't shatter (yet). I just went back to hurting myself. I can't feel the pain. I feel as though there's no point to being, and after I graduate, I should find a nice place in the wilderness and kiss the shotgun. All of these people here live such perfect lives. They've never been in a fight they didn't want to be in. Never went hungry. Never struggled for place in society. Success breeds success. They've traveled all around the world, and I just recently left my home state. Some people have no idea the opportunity they are given, it is there for them at birth. That this is the way society is, there is nothing else. It makes me angry. I understand I somewhat describe myself, but that doesn't change my opinion at all. 

That's about it I suppose. Let me know if I'm just being an idiot.";dckook10

This has been a big part of my depressive cycles when they occur, and for a long period of time I took it outside of depressive times, feeling like I had to be bigger, like the depressed side of me was the real, true side to me. There’s no infinity or 0, but there’s something close. As time has gone on, I feel like these cycles of depression and reach for the absolute max of something has changed me. I don’t feel like the person I was a year ago, but I don’t feel like myself today. I’ve never felt really comfortable in my own skin, but depression has somewhat humbled and quieted me forever. Sometimes when I’m feeling okay for a longer period of time then usual (around a week usually), I feel a big sense of depersonalization, like I’m just a false clone of myself. When I think of this concept, I realize how impractical and it begins to feel like a large waste of time, which pushes me further into an infinite loop of depression. There’s something much bigger, stretched, louder that I am in constant fear I will never find. For now, I want to disappear and not have to be here. Please;MrUnderdawg

&#x200B;

I (m25) live in a shared flat with 2 other guys of which one is a really good friend of mine. The thing is my friend has a gf I had a bad start with. She behaved badly and besides I don´t like that type of character. I´m suffering from depression for 4 years now of which I´ve been in therapy 2-3 times a week for 2 or 3 years.

&#x200B;

So now the actual issue:

His gf visits him several times a week and I don´t feel comfortable around her so I isolate myself even more. I don´t really know what to do. My plan is to talk more intensively to my therapist about that obviously. I´m not really sure if I should talk to my flatmate about it, because I can´t expect him to not have his gf over and I don´t want him to feel uncomfortable either.

I might be oversensitive in that matter as I had an abusive ex that somehow managed to stay afte around in my previous shared flat with another flatmate resulting in me totally isolating myself.

&#x200B;

In a few weeks I´m staying in a hospital for 2-3 months due to depression which might solve this problem for that time.

154;Useless venting;2;biasuh;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biasuh/useless_venting/;5;2019-04-28 09:36:20;" I always say that, but seriously: first of all, **please, don't read this if you don't have time to lose**, it's gonna be a long post, and it's just me venting about my first world problems from my useless life.

&#x200B;

This is just to help me feel at least a bit better I guess, don't even know if that's gonna work but, here goes nothing.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of being alone, and being alive, and whatever are the responsabilities of being alive in today's world. Also I don't have any friends left. Well, that's not true, I do have two friends, but I barely speak to them anymore and they both live far away, so I haven't talked to anyone in a long time.

   I don't have goals, I don't have dreams, to be honest I'd like to live as a medieval hermit, somewhere random, hidden; that is, without refusing the use of modern medicine, of course. But I digress.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of sitting in front of beautiful landscapes, and enjoying the simple beauty of nature and the city with its cathedral in the distance (I live in France, idk if there are many cathedrals outside europe tbh), behind the fields and the woods down my street, without having anyone to enjoy it with.

   I'm not necessarily talking about romantic relationships, I'm just tired of having never met people who like the same things as me; simple things, no talking in people's back all the time and complaining about the drama, what school's 84th Stacy said about Chad or if Adam is a virgin or not, I just want to experience once more the feeling of spending time with just *one* other human being and enjoying it.

&#x200B;

I don't want to go to school when my teachers treat me like trash, and I was forced into something I didn't want to study (wanted to do 'L' studies — which are literary studies here in France —, but my parents said it wouldn't get me any job) so obviously I don't study much. There's no such thing as afterclass clubs here, so, can't really make new friends that way.

&#x200B;

   The romantic relationship subject is a whole other story, I've never been in one, and I don't really care about it, since I'm not a good person and I don't want to hurt anyone. I won't go much into it, as this is already way too long, but basically my hobbies are trash, I'm not rich, I'm short, ugly, I have anger issues with my siblings, hell I'm not even intelligent.

&#x200B;

I can't draw for my life despite practicing for a decade and taking lessons, too lazy to learn an instrument, not good at sports, basically I don't have any talent (except rambling on the Internet, that I do well). I just kind of... exist, I guess.

   Which makes me feel like a waste of human space, amongst almost 8 billion other humans, who have much more potential than I do. Seeing how a large percentage of the population live, I feel so bad for complaining about stuff like loneliness, what kind of piece of utter garbage am I to be sad when there are so many people without drinkable water out there.

&#x200B;

I've considered suicide sometimes, because why the frick not, literally no one would miss me except my parents, but they would forget me in like, two days, so whatever. You die anyway in the end, may it be tomorrow in a car accident or of old age in a few decades; but I don't really have the balls to do it, so don't worry, I won't be tickling my guts with a knife or drinking bleach anytime soon, I think.

   I suppose everything all comes down to natural selection. You may think this is a stupid way of thinking, but it does make sense if you think of it, because as I said: I'm ugly, short, stupid, my personality is trash, I have poor mental health, I'm not rich... It only makes sense that I wouldn't have any friend. Or girlfriend/boyfriend. If I don't have anything to bring into anyone's life, then why should they bother? I don't deserve anything.

&#x200B;

Well, I think that's it. I do actually feel slightly better, so I guess that's good. If you read that shit entirely, thank you I guess. This is just a rambling/ranting/venting post but if you wanna give your opinion on how I should kms go ahead, whatever, just have fun.";YoungCoffeeBean

In fact, imo, we’ve been able to help one another grow and communicate better. We’ve both gone through moments of crisis that have allowed us to help one another grow and improve. Most recently I lost myself to some bouts of dissociation after my father almost died and the actual death of my grandfather. It messed me up real bad, and I’m finally stable. My ex was there through it all. I wouldn’t made it through without him. 

In fact, it’s been really healing. At least on my end. It built trust and it made me feel closer to him. I knew we still loved each other because we talked about it. Or maybe that was all a lie. I can’t tell anymore. 

All the bad stuff from our past didn’t just disappear though. One night I had a really bad panic attack and went off on him. I regret it immensely. I didn’t call him names or anything, I just blamed him for a lot of my problems. It was bad, and I apologized profusely. Nothing has been the same since. 

When I noticed the change, I began to question him about what was wrong, and he would always shrug it off, never communicating to me what was really going on. I assumed it was my fault he was distant, after how unreasonably upset I had become with him, but he would always deny that was the case. 

 I can’t say this for sure, but I kinda think it’s just been like this. He withdrew. Stopped telling people what was up, at least outside of his therapist. I say this because I would check in with his friends, ask how he was doing and they really didn’t know much.

Eventually tho, he broke and told me how severely depressed he was. He was really upset when he told me, putting a lot of the blame on me, (probably deserved since I had been such a birch the other night) but I also considered that perhaps I was talking about my problems too much, so I resigned myself to work on that. So I gave him some space. 

The next day he called and asked to hang out after going to see his therapist. He said he was sorry and realized I was only trying to help. 

After seeing his therapist, he changed his mind and decided it was best if we didn’t meet up. I’ll admit, I didn’t handle it well. I felt something was off and had a panic attack. Again, I really love this guy. (Btw his therapist suggested it.)

After that, I left him alone for a week. Plus he wast talking to me anyways. But I was worried about him. I knew he was depressed so I checked his Reddit profile. I literally NEVER do this, but I had a gut feeling. Sure enough, he made a post about “never before considered committing suicide” It was a longer title, but I don’t want to give away his user name. But yeah, I was alarmed.

He wasn’t speaking to me, (again, not sure why exactly. We didn’t have a falling out) so I created another reddit account and asked him to DM me for more info/help. When he did, I advised him to create a support group and be sure to communicate to more people about what’s going on in his life. I told him it can be hard to do, but it’s essential. Having a therapist and one friend isn’t enough. 

Anyways, he tells me he didn’t think he was going to hurt himself, but he had never before visualized killing himself so frequently and it was freaking him out. That’s the jist of it, I can’t remember it verbatim. But I do know for a fact he said he had been visualizing suicide frequently. 

So I took that information and gave it to my therapist. Oddly enough, my therapist is friends with his therapist and I believed it would be helpful for his therapist to understand the full extent of what was going on. Even though he had probably already told her everything, I felt like it was important, just in case. I also included that he wasn’t telling his psychiatrist about his deep depression, so he wasn’t being prescribed antidepressants. 

I didnt know what else to do. He wouldn’t talk to me, so I felt like I had to tell someone. 

Towards the end of the week he texted me saying he wanted to meet up again, but once more, he changed his mind. I begged him to talk to me on the phone, but he wouldn’t. I’m pretty desperate to understand what’s going on. So I sent an email, once again emphasizing how important it was to have support, to not simply rely on a therapist and one other person. 

He replied by saying he was hollow and empty inside. Isolated and alone in this city he is living in, 3 hours from his friends and family. He said other things as well, but that’s what I focused on considering everything else that I knew. 

So I got in my car and drove to him. Before I left, I called my dad, my brother, and three of my best friends, just to see if I was making the right call. I knew it was a risky move since he wanted space, but again, I dont know what’s changed between us band I knew he was in a really bad spot. Two weeks earlier we were best friends. Today, everything is different. I know it has something to do with how he’s feeling and how I’m feeling, but I just felt so desperate to make him feel less alone. I want him to be happy, not complete isolated. 

I love this guy a lot. I’d do anything to make him feel better. That’s all I’ve been trying to do since the moment I found out how depressed he is. 

But now I’m being called a stalker. When I arrived he wasn’t home and a mutual friend of ours called asking where I was. I told her, and she was told me to leave. I asked her if she knew everything that was wrong. She did not. After I told her, she called him and told him about the alternate account I used to figure out what was wrong with him. He told me I was fucked. 

He’s never spoken to me like that before.

I don’t know how to process this because I honestly don’t know what’s happened. If any of this had occurred two or three weeks ago, none of these reactions would have happened. 

I just want him to get better, but idk what else to do besides leave his life. Hard pill to swallow, but I don’t have another choice at this point. 

Any suggestions? Can you tell me what I did wrong?

Edit: I left out some important info.

This guys is also my best friend. Not just an ex. He calls me every day, multiple times. Usually in the morning on the way to work and then again on the way home. Plus other phone calls here and there, text messages, etc. 

He bought a house a while back that he was unable to live in because he had to move for work. He asked me to stay there and the told me it would be cool if I continued living there after we broke up. 

He comes up most weekends to hang out and see his therapist. 

We both signed consent forms which allow our therapists to discuss certain pre approved topics since my ex and I have such closely entwined lives. The only stuff I know about is the stuff my ex has shared with me or things we have both consented in sharing. Otherwise, our therapists keep anything they’ve discussed about us, to themselves.";soft-whispersweat

Alright so I googled the number and found the ""Kassenärztliche Vereinigung"" website which is horribly structured. But I manage to find a phone number and called. Turns out, it was the wrong number but the person I spoke to gave me another one. It was the fax again.

I've had enough and searched for a therapist myself. Found a practice that's nearby with some great psychotherapists and already got my hopes up. So I wrote them an e-mail and got a 16 lines heavy message back on how to proceed further because apparently they don't support my health insurance. Wanna hear another long ass german word? 

""Kostenerstattungsverfahren"", a procedure were my insurance and I share the costs for therapy. But first I need an initial clinical interview to assess the gravity of my condition. And guess who I need to contact for that? The ""Kassenärztliche Vereinigung"" of course! But this time with the right number. Doesn't matter though because no one answered the phone. So I wrote them an e-mail and got an appointment with a therapist. I went there and he asked for my health insurance card which I gave him. It didn't work. Something was wrong with the card. But we've had the conversation anyway and he gave me a recipe that stated my urgent treatment. I called my health insurance but they said they need a code which I didn't have because the card didn't work. They also told me that they don't support the ""Kostenerstattungsverfahren"" unless there's no other way.

So now I'm waiting for my new card.

...

Seriously?

I have depression. I struggle to do the most basic tasks every day. My apartment is a bloody mess, my grades are really bad and I leave my friends and family behind. I just want professional help. But this procedure is nothing one should go through who doesn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Do you need a failed suicide attempt to get some treatment? Why is this so complicated?

I've been feeling so emotionally numb lately. My self harm and eating disorder have been out of control and I just feel detached and empty. I tried listening to the same songs that would usually make me at least start feeling really depressed again but this time I just felt nothing.

Football practice had though, and I was a newbie to basically any sports at all. I was a twig: pale, bony and thin. I was a nerd. I had been bullied in the past, but I thought that joining the football team might make it better. At the very least, it'd help spite the people who said I was a wimp and couldn't take it like they could.

So I went into the August heat of Texas for two-a-day practice. I showed up before the sun, took a break for lunch, and then practiced again.

I worked hard. I learned and performed the drills. I sprinted, ran, I pulled my weight. I overheated, and threw up after drinking cold water. On my first day, I wasn't very good. Not quick, agile, or strong. But whenever the handful of opportunities came to volunteer I volunteered, no matter how I felt. I kept my mouth shut and didn't complain.

When it was done, I was exhausted and sunburnt. I had never been so tired in my life and I hurt all over. My knees and arms were jelly.

I finally got home. This is the part I remember best. I walked into my room, and from the window to my bed there was a pool of sunlight. I didn't even get all the way onto my bed, and I didn't get undressed. I laid my top half down on the bed and let everything relax. I remember how satisfied and proud I was of myself, and what the sun felt like through my shirt on my back. I remember closing my eyes for a second, and waking up an hour later.

I don't think anything has been as good since.

I wish I could go back to that moment, and relive my life from there.";LastLeigh

At the time I also had a crush on a girl I barely knew. One night that week I was talking to my best friend about how I had a crush on the other girl. To this day I have no clue why I still had the crush. Odd story short from what it seemed he went behind my back and told my now gf. I trusted him with everything. 2 days later me and my gf broke up. At this point I was already starting to feel down that my best friend would go behind my back and tell.  I knew I was in the wrong though. During the last portion of November and into December me and my ex stayed bestfriends and ended up become friends with benefits. January came around and we decided hey my b-day was the 28, why dont we hang out the 27 and do the deed. Little did I know that Friday a guy she barely knew and talked to asked her out. I didnt find out till the night before. Speed forward to mid February we stopped being friends with benefits. We started to barely even talk over the phone and irl. During the time we were friends with benefits I guess I had fallen in love with her. At the end of February we ended up calling and started to lose it. I started balling my eyes out because I didnt want to lose her to him. I asked if she was truly happy with him she said no. 1 or 2 days later they broke up. 2 ish weeks later on March 16 our school had a formal, we both went together, little did I know what she had planned. We slow danced a few times before she did it. I believe the first one was to Speechless by Dan & Shay. A little while later she asked if she could have my phone for a few. I let her have it because I trusted her. She ran to the bathroom with a few friends. I only thought she was going to “hack” my snap story. She comes back 5 minutes later puts my phone in my pocket and tells not to look at it. About 20 minutes pass by when we were all sitting at a table she told me it was time to look at my phone. I pulled it out and my lock screen was a pic of her that said “hacked by your girlfriend”. My face lit up. About a week after that I started to always worry about her. Fast forward to spring break we hung out almost the entire week. I felt great like I had nothing to worry about. I eventually slumped back down into a dark state where I was always worried and scared about what was happening. Even when I knew she was fine and safe. Fast forward again to one month. I still felt the same except now I had started cutting due to the feeling. Just this last Thursday I was hanging out with a friend and was vaping with 50 nic. Around 10 I got a strange feeling of loneliness. I asked my girl if she wanted me to come over for a little. She said she did so I left my friends house completely mindlessly. Little did I know her house was nearly 2 miles away. I ran/walked the whole way while I believe I was buzzed. By the time I had got there I was crying and scared I had nearly been hit by cars 2-3 times. I could barely stand and was freezing. We cuddled up and I started balling, I cant even remember why. All I remember saying was I missed her and was scared to lose her. 20 minutes passed and I was told I had to walk back to my friends because her stepdad would be home soon. I still couldnt even stand, she said she would hide me in her room till he went to bed. She later came in and laid next to me. We cuddled up and I started to tell her I was sorry about coming. An hour or so passed and I started telling her my personal problems, she comforted me. I ended up falling asleep and kept waking up though the night. She never slept that night. When morning came around I had to take the 2 mile walk back and so I did. Not knowing that would be the last time  we ever would hang out again. Monday of this week came around we did our normal thing, Tuesday got a little odder when she started telling me that she hates who she is and wants to change. I wasnt about it, I wont say what she wanted to do just incase friends or family see this post. She brought it back up Thursday night and this is where my point of living fell. She asked what I thought about it, I told her I was against it. We argued for a little. A little bit later her best friend text me and told me she was balling her eyes out. At this point I started to cry, this continued for a bit. My gf told me she wanted to be left alone. This is when I knew my relationship was over and I had nothing left. I started screaming why, I hit my head against things and punched my wall till the point my hand started to cut open. I put about 6 cuts into my arm and laid there balling out of control, I have never cried like this before. The next morning she wouldnt even let me touch her or talk to her. Later in the day came and we talked. I held her in my arms as we both began to cry. She ended up going to class shortly after telling her I loved her and put her hand on my heart. This is when for the first time ever I skipped class and just sat in the hall and cried to myself. It is now Sunday April 28 5:51am I have lost all want to live, I have lost all hope, and I have started to think about how Im going to end my life and where. There is nothing in my life I want more than her back. 

If she finds this she will know who she is. And to any family or friends that see this b4 it is too late dont try anything there is no point.";EnragedDom

It started off with my best friend of primary school and 2 others who bullied me for 2 years. Since it was my former best friend you can imagine I felt lost and nowhere to really turn. 

In year 9 it got even worse. My former best friend actually stopped as I spoke up and defended myself against him. I’m actually ok with him now as he really did apologise after we left school and realised what he had done. But this other guy started who was even worse, I’ve tried reaching out to him after school but he just ignores me. If I ever see him again god help him. Then nearly the whole year group started bullying me. it was seriously bad, you can’t defend yourself if everybody is bullying you, I felt trapped. I see people around from school sometimes and it’s always in my mind to hit them but they are different people now, I will look like the bad guy. It drives me crazy though they just think they never affected me or did anything wrong, we just have normal nice conversations about life, it’s mad really. I was probably the biggest outcast in the school I used to walk around on my own when my ‘friends’ used to run away from me. 

It wrecked my grades as I didn’t want to be there I just ignored trying to learn and just wanted to go home, it was just survival. I’d say I’m quite clever but I can only get crap jobs now because of my grades. I broke out of it at college as it was a fresh start and I was really looking up I made loads of friends and the bullying was gone and out of my head. Then my grandma died and I went into depression and no self esteem again and then everybody in my college class started bullying me. Now I have no self esteem and I’m in my mid 20s still a virgin not really knowing how to act around people. 2 weeks ago, this girl I loved, I’ve known from childhood rejected me as my self esteem caused me to try and be better than I was and I went off the rails drinking and I quit my job. But now once again I’ve come back round to confront my demons. Problem is I don’t no how. Since it happened from when I was 11-17 I think it’s engraved into my brain and it’s now who I am. Maybe a bit like serial killers they get traumatised as children and there brains are just wired different. People like me now and I am funny but when I am socialising I am always looking for approval. Or looking to be more and better as I feel I’m never good enough. Then I come across as fake while all then who bullied me come across as normal. The girl I loved stopped seeing me as I was trying to not be me. I want to put an end to this. We are friends again but I want to show her and another girl that I want to be me. Will a therapist help do you think?";

Idk how much longer I can keep going guys. My mentality hasn't changed and I've tried. Everything hurts so bad. People say they care but I can't feel it.

Meds don't work, self medicating doesn't work, putting on a fake personality no longer works.

Life isn't the way I've dreamed of when I was a kid, if I saw myself now back then I'd hate what I've become, and I'm only 17.

I can't get a job, am more than a year behind in school, losing friends, have made enemies. Can't keep a relationship, can't be the son I know my mom wanted. I can't shake the feeling that I just don't belong here. Not after all the wrong choices I've made.

I don't know how to fix myself and it scares me. 

Death also, admittedly scares me, but I know at some point the impulse will overcome that fear.

i feel like I need a jumpstart to just get my life back on track. Idk how I'd do it. I can barely get myself out of bed most days. Can barely do the things I enjoy. 

any advice would be appreciated. sorry for being so negative I really just don't know how long I can last. I keep saying tonight's the night but it never is.

I'm a 29 year old male.

I started taking Escitalopram (20mg) 2 months ago. I went through a breakup before that, but am now back together with my girlfriend.

My problem is now, that I can't get an orgasm while sleeping with her. I get an erection and got no problem maintaining it.

I have no problem getting an orgasm while masturbating (to pornography) though.

I never had such problems before, even while taking other antidepressants (Sertralin, Venlafaxin). I'm super worried, that something's not wrong with me or with my feelings towards her (allthough I'm attracted to her and can get an erection...)!

Does anybody else has experience with or advice for this? It's a rather intimate subject... Thanks in advance!";ItsEerie

I've had depression for years, was diagnosed, told to go to therapy and never did. I was self harming, withdrawing from friends and family, not going into college, and got bad grades. 

Then university came along, my girlfriend cheated on me and left me for someone else. That sent me over the edge. The next few month were full with drugs, alcohol, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. 

Eventually I thought enough is enough, I went to therapy, and while it was nice to talk and get it all out, it personally wasn't for me. So I went to the doctor's and got prescribed antidepressants, and while I'm not perfect, my life is a lot better now than it ever was. I feel like myself again, I have passions, more outgoing, much more social and I'm actually enjoying life again.

So to anyone who is suffering, taking that first step towards getting better is ALWAYS the hardest, but is the best decision you'll ever make.";Energace

217;A History with Depression;5;bi8u9i;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi8u9i/a_history_with_depression/;3;2019-04-28 04:32:00;"My mom put me on anti-depressants around the age of 12. She'd warned me before puberty that I would have depression, like she did, like my grandma did. It was genetic, and it was ok because the drugs would fix it.

I know she meant well. The drugs helped her get through it so she wanted to set up her children to function as best as they could. With the help of pharmaceuticals. 

&#x200B;

I was a very obedient/respectful teen. Highly scheduled. i remember knowing i was terrible, that it was probably due to the hormones. so i kept to myself mostly. cried a lot. (this was all while i was on a carousel of anti-depressants + birth control.  kept changing out the pills/psychologists bc we weren't really seeing any good results from any of them)

&#x200B;

i took up ""film"" as a hobby. because it meant i could stay home and watch a lot of movies-not engage in life really- and call it a hobby. 

&#x200B;

i think a lot about how the meds affected my teen years. i had no sex drive, and felt confused about how my friends could even flirt, it seemed so foreign, impossible. i felt so childish, lame, left out.

&#x200B;

i used to be so mad at my mom for doing that to me. for putting this label on me, this neat little box of emotion. ""oh i have depression, that's why i feel this way"". for dosing an otherwise healthy child. (America's habit of prescribing children with meds is out of control imo.  i know meds help a lot of people, but if this many people need medication, maybe there's a bigger issue at play here...)

&#x200B;

but anyways, who knows? maybe without the meds, and with an irrational teen mind, i wouldve killed myself. i forgave my mom. (and i love her so much)

&#x200B;

i saw a therapist as a teen, but i hated it. id just go and cry, and resolve nothing. 

&#x200B;

  I got off the meds when I was 18. I wanted to see what I was like without anything in my system...if I even had 'depression' at all. Because the pills pretty much numbed out my entire adolescence.

&#x200B;

after leaving parent's home:

started smoking weed. picked it up as a daily habit eventually. 

&#x200B;

very depressed in college- i had no idea what i wanted to study, had no idea what i was doing there, so i left. one of the best decisions i ever made, one of the hardest for my parents to accept-even still. that was when the 'obedient child' phase of my life ended. 

&#x200B;

my first bf had dealt with depression as a teen as well, but was done with it by the time we were together. id cry, he'd coddle me, so id cry even more. our relationship became that.  he stopped wanting to spend time with me. i couldnt blame him.  with him, i felt locked into an old-married-couple style relationship at age 22. and i wondered ""is this it? grocery shopping, and working, and cooking, and drinking and smoking and over and over again."" 

&#x200B;

we broke up, i traveled a lot, ate a lot of psychedelics. they helped a lot. connected me to fellow humans, to nature, to music and dance. and they+weed also almost drove me crazy. (i abused them, treated them like party-drugs. they're not. those are stories for a different sub i think.)

&#x200B;

my next partner couldn't accept the depression. he told me that. he didn't understand why i should be upset about nothing. i couldn't explain it to him, or to myself really. he asked me if i had a brain tumor. i realized i dont ever want to try to explain it to someone.

\-with this guy, was the first time in my life I feared death-what a new experience! I loved him so much, I was scared to die and lose him. or scared he would die....then that spiraled back to depression.. if even love couldn't make me happy, wtf could?

&#x200B;

the next partner had a nightmare where he was stuck in a simulated reality of his worst life experiences and each time he woke up, he was still in the nightmare's loop, and it sounded so terrifying...i wonder if i had had that nightmare i might not have woken up from it.  we both agreed it was my fault he had that nightmare. i had this toxicity in me, and it had spread to him.  and if i didn't get it out, who knows what would happen. i went into the woods with him to try to get it out, to cough it up, to scream, to cry, to spit, to yell it out. i thought i got close, but then...no. we broke up so horribly, dramatically.

&#x200B;

after that, i stayed with a fellow-depressed friend. i didn't have to explain anything. it was the most 'seen' i have ever felt in my life. 

&#x200B;

he even helped me understand it a bit, that the depression is a response, ""what can i do? nothing? so i will do nothing""

&#x200B;

im single now, very grateful to be going thru this bout of depression without a significant other. no one to drag down or feel guilty about. no one to explain anything to. no one to blame me for w/e. i can just feel my feelings and move on. besides i can do a pretty great job of cheering myself up if i give myself the chance.

&#x200B;

thing is,

we live in a very depressing world. sure its also wonderful, but yea its also f'''ing sh't. to be depressed makes perfect sense. (remember tho, its not the whole story)

&#x200B;

i feel so helpless in this world. if i cant help everyone, at least i can cry for everyone. and i do. very often. 

&#x200B;

i also laugh as often as i can. memes saved my life this last bout of suicidal thoughts. wowowow people are so funny. and so deep, and expressing such intense and raw thoughts/feelings with just a picture and a few words. and to know other people feel the same as me, makes me feel less lonely, more connected. thank internet for the internet.

&#x200B;

i try to let myself be cheered up whenever it arises. so maybe im horribly and despairingly depressed a few times a day. im also happy, grateful and connected a few times a day. this too shall pass. (of course, knowing the good times will pass too makes me depressed as well. but lately im just trying not be so dramatic about it). kittens and puppies -even just videos, or a cute lil dog trottin by on the street- work amazing magic on me. also vine compilations-seriously how are humans this funny rip vine

&#x200B;

i know happiness isnt a goal, its part of life. so is sadness. its all beautiful and terrible. and its also exhausting.  and thats ok.

&#x200B;

i will try to start seeing a therapist soon, but the motivation to find someone i trust enough to talk to is pretty low atm.

i have amazing friends who are such supportive, patient listeners, i am so so so lucky-but yea i dont want to abuse the friendships. (I didnt always have good friends, so I really do appreciate the ones Ive found. keep looking till you find yours.)

&#x200B;

Found a few patterns-and when i find myself asking these questions, I know I'm letting depression 'drive the bus' -as my mom says:

'whats the point in trying?""

""what am i supposed to be doing?""

""is this it?""

""I don't know how to make this work""

""How am I so incompetent?""

""wtf is wrong with me?""

&#x200B;

take a deep breath, reset, cry it out, sleep, journal, patience, call a friend, watch a funny video.

 (also, a yoga teacher taught me: sit cross legged, straight back, take a deep breath. make a low 'ooo' sound. go for as long as you want. go as low as you can go. keep breathing and keep singing. cry if you need to. then keep singing. let it all out. i used to do this in the bathroom at work even. this taught me how singing can be an incredible emotional outlet. words cant express everything...)

&#x200B;

I am not a victim, and I dont want to feel sorry for myself.  i dont want to go back on pharmaceuticals. i want to learn to ride the waves. if sadness makes sense to me, so can happiness. some good advice i received - ""don't get too excited"". i was getting too excited, manic, and then crashing and that was nooo good. to be more zen in good times and bad..

&#x200B;

I like cbd a lot. weed can make me too anxious, antisocial. i thought i had social anxiety for years, but i realized it was just because i always smoked before socializing. i prefer weed for solo activites (stretching, painting, watching shows)

\---socializing pro tip: ask people about themselves. people are comfortable talking about themselves. and will open up very quickly. keep asking questions until you find something youre genuinely interested in, then go from there.

&#x200B;

anyways,

cry when you have to cry (maybe go to the bathroom if you dont want to call attention to yourself).

pee when you have to pee.

drink water when you're thirsty.

&#x200B;

let them fluids flow.

&#x200B;

thanks for reading my essay, i know its a mess, but so is life, and its a beautiful mess amirite?

The two relationships I actually had were a abusive so I don't know what a 'normal' relationship feels like or how it functions.

I can't seem to find anyone either. I don't know if it's because I'm not the most confident in the world or because people think I'm ugly or just cause I'm not that cool, but I'm not attracting the right people into my life romantically, just more of those red-flag people like I've had before. It's strange. I don't claim to be perfect or devoid of any criticism but I can get along with pretty much anyone. People think I'm super nice, funny, smart and I have cool friends
 but I still feel like in order to be interesting I need to have accomplished something or have some unique acheivment. I try that with music, but in my course, sound engineering, that's 90% of the class so I'm kind of lost in the fray.

I'm not claiming to be entitled to a partner but it just doesn't make sense why I, someone who's worked through their issues and takes care of myself and what have you, still only attract the people that I used to be, if that makes sense.

I get scared thinking if I actually have some underlying issue or if I'm in the wrong place

And it's very upsetting that those ideas of her could spark once again because they are completely false and nonsense, she wanted to get me to 'confess' but that is something that never happened on the first place. It makes things worse, I'm scared of the moment she'd get those ideas again and I really dislike that.

I have 2 months without work and spend the last 10$ of my savings about 4 weeks ago buying only lentils and rice. I have been eating only rice for the last week and today in the morning i have spent my last cup of rice, i haven't eated since then. I don't keep track of my weight but i can feel the bones of my coccyx every time i sit down so i think i have lost 10 kg or more in the last month and my parents are in the same situation, they are in the bones and that pierce my soul like a knife every time i see them. My sister its a presumptuous bitch and my brother it's trying to move to Ecuador with his wife, so this will split the family even more.

I identify myself like a life warrior, i have pass through hard depression, many addictions, rejection, suicidal thoughts and here i am, alive and working forward for a better life. If my university don't go to strike again i'm will be an mechanical engineer in this late year, and be ""happy"" to work for less than 1$ the hour... i really don't know how i have made this far but i'm kind of amazed of my self, i have seize every income opportunity that comes to me to stay on float in the country blessed with the highest inflation of the world.

My point is, i'm in recovering process from a depressive episode that leave me living like a homeless man during 6 months the past year, i feel like i'm more strong than ever and i'm trying to put everything in order to get back on the ropes and fight for a better life but at this point, were i am right now, i feel like this is too much and i'm losing the grip. I feel like i'm no enough to handle this situation, its like everything i do worth nothing, all the people around me keep saying me that i'm brilliant, i'm so talented and here i am, starving to death. I'm starting to feel like the past year, with a voice in my head that says ""just give up, let's make it simple again"". If i don't get a score soon, just 1 win, i'm will be back to were i was the past year and all my progress will become nothing, maybe worst. I know i have to keep moving but i don't know were, i have tried so many things that doesn't work, wasted much time in worthless shit, i'm just lost in this point.

I just know that i have to keep moving. All this post was just a kind of catharsis. I'm not asking for help, i have already made a post on r/Assistance that it's like throwing a bottle to the sea, the same when i try to find help with friends, so i give up on asking for help. I have nobody to talk about this directly, not even my family so this is my way out.

226;I'm experiencing dissociation & am terrified.;2;bi8py9;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi8py9/im_experiencing_dissociation_am_terrified/;0;2019-04-28 04:12:49;"I think it's been happening for a long time, it's just that now its affecting me strong enough that I am well aware of it. It's quite frightening, on a different level to major panic attacks. In my panic attacks, though it turns to suicidal thoughts my thoughts are straight forward and consequent feelings are therefore justified. But with these dissociative episodes, there is no major thought, no feeling but fright - I can move nothing but my eyeballs underneath eyelids of which are stretched to the max. I dart my sight where my stationary position allows, in relative terror, and over my body. All feels out of place, it feels like I should be or maybe am looking down on this body from another. Every second is quite frightening.

It's an added bonus that I have really made an effort to turn my life around this year. I have moved a world away from my comfort zone, my home and closest friends, in a bid to focus on myself and my well being. There is always something to bring me back down, sadly I always forget that amidst the excitement of potential. I am scared. I know I am not crazy, well, I hope so, but this makes me feel like I'm getting close. I hate when this happens - when the ""I just want it to end"" thought comes crawling back to mamma.

If you have felt this way, I empathise with you as I'm sure others will too, and that whatever we might say to you can provide a bit of comfort. Maybe you want to share your experiences, not even just concerning disassociation, but anything you've experienced that is out of your hands that has frightened you lots, or most. Maybe you have advice concerning what to do when experiencing these episodes.

I can't get a job or a drivers license. I can't move out. I can't get a gf. I can't get anything. I've tried applying for numerous places when I had the chance, but none of them ever called back. Most of the times I kinda forget about it and don't really ask them, which is partially my fault, but then again they never take me hardly ever to get a job application or help me through the driver manual and take me to the DMV or anything. So I'm just stuck here. I don't like my family. In fact, I hate them. I hate them enough to actually kill them because that's how much I hate them. I've had to put up with not only my mom's shit but also with my grandparents and little (half) brothers shit too. I've held in my murderous rage for all of these years because of many reasons. I don't want to go to prison for the rest of my life, and I don't think the idea of death sounds very pleasant either, so I'm just stuck here. And they hide all the weapons from me, so there's no means I have of finally taking out all those years of repressed anger out on them. But at the same time, I have no escape from them either. My only coping mechanism is going outside. Now I don't even have that anymore. They always go out there and invade my personal space when I just simply want to be left alone. I can't run away either, because there's nowhere for me to go and because they would probably call the police and even my dad on me if I were missing. And that's another thing. My mom really does hate my dad, but she always summons him when I get fed up with her shit. So I can't even do anything at all. I feel like losing my mind with anger, stress, frustration, depression, anxiety, rage, and all that other bullshit they put me through constantly and have been putting me through constantly for YEARS and YEARS and YEARS and YEARS. Since my counselor is never available, I'm going to see a new one at a different place after I tried getting myself committed yesterday because I didn't want to deal with my dad and I needed to get away from them desperately, but they told me that there wasn't anything they could've done for me and they likely would've only been able to keep me there for 24 hours before releasing me back into this same shithole that I've known far too well for all of these years. 

&#x200B;

I am now going to see if I can get into this new apartment place at this mental health center, but it's taking way too long for the bitch who runs the place to get off her maternity leave and my patience is running out. I feel like breaking the law and doing something illegal and get sent to jail just so I can get the fuck out of here, because there's no other way out for me. It's gotten to where my stress, anxiety, depression, anger, and everything else is 24/7 now, and I can't even go to sleep at night anymore. I always get all itchy and need to get up to urinate constantly at nighttime anyways. I have no family or friends to move in with, and in fact, I don't even have any friends at all. So I have to repeatedly call the Suicide Lifeline every single day now, to where I'm getting too worn out and tired to repeat my situation every single time to every single counselor on there, because there's too much going on and there's too much for me to talk about to where I could go on for days about what's happening and what happened that lead up to this present moment in time, to where I just get tired of calling them. This is the only outlet for my anger and depression. I don't even have the means of making this suffering end so I'm just stuck here with no other way out. I'm just gonna live through this nightmare for the rest of my short, miserable life. I even tried getting into college, but they called it off behind my back. I tried getting into vocational rehab, but I only showed up for a few appointments and when they called back, I never called them back, and it's been months since we've ever spoke or met. It's likely because I don't want to hear them get onto me about not showing up or calling them back, which will stress me out even more. I don't even possess the basic skills to live on my own because nobody here has ever taught me them. Instead, they just go through my room and throw all my shit away to where even my own room I don't have. Nothing that belongs to me truly belongs to me over here. I only had a job for one day and it was picking peanuts at some farm getting paid $5 after hours and hours of backbreaking work just to pick each peanut individually, look at them to see if they were good or bad, if they were good, putting them in the bucket, until I finally managed to fill one bucket, before I managed to fill a second one after even more hours of hard labor and getting paid a measly $10, so I just decided to quit and never came back again, because it wasn't worth it. 

&#x200B;

And another thing is that my mom lives off my disability money. My dad recommended me to go on disability, so I told my mom and her parents about this, they decided to work towards it, but when I saw my doctor, she told him that I would spend all of that money on drugs, so now she has it in her name in her bank account and I don't get a single penny of it as she spends it on herself and only uses it to buy me cigarettes and other cheap shit that isn't going to benefit me in the long run, and even has the audacity to tell me what to buy with it, but since she knows I can't do anything about it and that she can get away with it, continues to do it anyways. I even had to spend my birthday money on her, myself and my friend who came over that day (he's my only friend that I still have and I haven't seen or heard from him in a while), even when she had my disability money that she could've at least used to pay for herself and Adrian. Fucking worthless bitch. And she even quit her job \*coincidentally\* around the same time she started receiving my disability checks in her bank account, and when I told my grandparents about this, they used that same bullshit excuse that it was because of some man at her job who was ""harassing"" her is why she left. But then again, she could've still applied for another job anyways and hasn't ever since she quit that job and started living off my money. She even told me one time that I am not allowed to have money or that I can't have it, probably because they want to rape all control over my life so that they can use me and keep me as their fucking pin cushion or doormat. 

&#x200B;

I could go on for ALL DAY and write an entire novel about all the shit that is bothering me and all the reasons why I hate them, but that would be pointless. I am so desperately trying to move out of here, but even doing that seems impossible. Nobody seems to understand my situation and how fucking dire it is that I get out I need to get out immediately but every counselor that I call never seems to understand me. I need somebody in my life who can get me out of here, but I have nobody sadly. It's like I desperately want to get out of here, but I'm not even prepared for the real world yet, because they never helped prepare me, so I'm stuck here with no other options and nowhere to go. I want to die, but my bad luck is just gonna keep dragging me further and further to where things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse until I finally can have my mercy killing. I know I'm probably gonna get hardly any responses (if any), but I at least need to get this off my chest for right now. I can't get out of here and no counselor ever seems to understand my situation. I need to get the fuck out now. I need to leave. I can't stay here forever. It's miserable here. I'm miserable every day. My life is never going to get better as long as I'm here.";Samson1911

It's selfish. How could someone do that to all their loved ones? Well I always think.... Why aren't the loved ones being selfish. If you've had major depression most of your life your friends and family see the struggles they also don't see the worst of it. How is it okay for them to be selfish because they don't want to feel the sadness of losing you but are alright with you being tormented everyday of your life. I think people need to start realizing that a majority of people who commit suicide do so after a very long struggle. And at that point I think deserve to be a little selfish considering the reason they lasted so long in the first place was probably because they were being ridiculously not selfish. This is a case where depression has taken their life. They only want to feel relieve just as a terminally ill patient wants to feel relieve . We have compassion and empathy for physically ill people. We need to start realizing that suicide is just another way a disease takes you and have understanding about that.;rubyrochelle11

Ive been crying for at least 30 min in my bath tube and Ive never cried this hard before ever! Im even dry heeving. I asked one super trusted friend to come over  but he's at work. 

Ive known him for like 7-8 months and he introduced me to a group of his friends. At this same time he introduced me to this girl that was also new to the group and my friend had only met her once. The second week of knowing this group and girl, we went to watch a movie. She cuddled with me and we held hands. When I dropped her off at her house she said she had allot of fun and that she was especially interested in me. We have been flirting through text ever since. 

My friend introduced us and has been trying to convince us to get together.

About three weeks ago I got super depressed and stoped talking to EVERYONE. I tried to meesage her once within that time but she didnt respond, so i said ""fuck it"" and thought i could fix thinngs when i saw her again at one of the group meetings. 

Today was the group meeting (at my house). She took a ride with a guy (I'm gonna call him Jeffery). Jeffery, this girl, and I have really similar tastes and interests, and we all seemed to get Allong well. During the party she was sitting next to Jeffery and had her legs on him(things that she had done with me, in front of Jeffery). But this just made me super upset. TThisis the first girl I have ever had an interest in, ever! ( I am 23) . And this really hurt me. 
 
Right now i am just trying to deduce wether that is just her personality or if she is interested I him

I think I heard him call her babe once but I'm not sure if I was projecting.

What I want to know is if I fucked up by not talking to her for a couple of weeks (I am sure I did l, but I was not in the state of mind to maintain a conversation/ relationship with anyone).

Details: I am a male 22 year old virgin.

I had my very first panic attack after meeting this girl. Making me realize that I actually want  to be with someone, and that I liked her.

We went out on a date once but I did don't called it a date, but I was still relatively dressed fancy, and according to my friend that introduced us, she seemed to understand that it was a date.

I know that my inexperience with girls has probably messed this up for me, but I just wanted know if there is anything I can do to win this girl over.  (I REALLY don't care about having sex, I just like her)

I should add that I don't really care about being a virgin, all my real friends know and it's been a choice so far.

I've been in therapy for years- mainly for anxiety, but with fluctuating depressive issues. However, now it seems to be helping less because of a recent wave of intense depression that won't leave (a little over a month now). I exercise, eat healthier than ever, take vitamins, etc. Doesn't seem to matter. Both my therapist and my family are bringing up the idea of anti-depressants. The issue is, trying medication seems daunting. The intital side effects to adjust to or wait out, plus the very possible loss of libido could easily destroy what's left of a relationship I have. And as far as medication with less side effects and libido impact goes, they all seem to increase anxiety. Because I already struggle with anxiety, that isn't the best news. I'm so cornered, but I am tired of dissolving into this constant and miserable ache. Part of me knows that moving forward with medication is inevitable at this rate, but the dread is so real...

I feel like such a lazy piece of shit. Everyone else I know is working hard, and I'm sitting at home. I've applied to literally dozens of places and have heard nothing back yet.

I don't know how people do it. I'll take a call that'll feel like ten hours and really only take two minutes. The only thing I can think of the minute the clock strikes ten and I get to leave is that I gotta do it again tomorrow. Imagine, leaving work on Friday night and being depressed knowing you go back in on Monday.

I don't know. I'm going to go in Monday and just be miserable because I have bills to pay. But I honestly want to die right now. If there is a hell, I imagine it's in a call center somewhere.

249;Dumb ADHD general life rant;2;bi8esw;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi8esw/dumb_adhd_general_life_rant/;0;2019-04-28 03:24:25;"Hey guys, first time poster, 20M college student. (Sorry for profanity). Here are some of my incoherent ramblings for the length of an essay, if you read this whole thing, Why? 

Depression hit me with the start of college and I didn't get diagnosed officially until last October, the peak of my issues. I was also diagnosed with ADHD at the same time which I had suspected for a while. Been on Zoloft and Adderall XR since and it's definitely helped me out a good deal. I felt incredible starting off with Adderall, productivity increased so much, I did pretty well last semester. However last few days I just feel like it isn't working like it used to. 2 days in a row now I've done nothing all day besides occasional breaks to eat or (feel shitty for saying this) jerking off. 2 days ago I decided to get high all alone, but I was actually pretty happy, today was gonna be productive. I'd finally start studying for exams. It took me until 1 to wake up tho, took meds, thought I'd feel better, fucking nothing. I took an extra one , thinking it would help as it did once earlier when I grinded out a project with an all nighter, still nothing.

I'm kinda just venting and just realized that losing  the schedule of classes I had to these study days before the exam made me sorta lose some efficiency, but I feel less productive and way more depressed than before. Am I too dependent on this shit? Parents were hesitant on getting it for me initially and I days I don't take it I'm absolutely fucking miserable. 

It's fucking 2 AM and you're reading my dumbass ADHD depression self pity rant, that's for that. Ugh, I'm just so fucking frustrated guys.

I have people who care about me, I'm a good human being goddamnit. Why can't I do some basic fucking studying. Parents worked their asses off to get me here and I can't even get out of bed. It's just one more week, I was doing so good, why now ugh. I slept during the day and can't now, just continuing to fuck myself over

Also I'm just constantly thinking about girls now, glad the Zoloft is fucking over my sex drive. But yeah I feel like I think about it too much, I feel like I should have gone through this back in high school, why now. Is jerking off like 6 times today gonna fuck me over in the long run. It's not even just that I'm.horny I want to feel.desired for once in my damn life. Never had a girlfriend but I'm not a fucking incel who thinks I deserve to have one by default. Girls like confident and motivated guys with personality, not r/niceguys got it. I worked on that and it's helped, like watching charisma on command vids, working out more, developing a fashion sense. I lost 15 pounds but the weight is slowly coming back now. I'm not ugly or fat, 6' 175. Just can't deal with some fucking acne and maybe the fact that I'm Indian. Like I get it, I don't find all girls attractive so they all won't find me attractive either, but I guess tinder failures and porn are fucking over my world view. 

I'm not entitled to anything, but damn it'd be nice for someone that isn't my mom or family friend say I'm attractive. I think most girls might not find Indian guys attractive and fuck it I don't blame them, culture always pens us as asexual fucking nerds. I don't want to ask for compliments cause I feel like a dick doing that, but one of the few friends I have has even said I kinda subconsciously do that, by like bringing up shit I'm proud of. Like last semester i dropped 2 classes and got a c and a d in the remaining ones, but I played a bunch of daily fantasy football and over a few weeks made $1000. Bought some clothes, bought parents and myself $100 watches for Christmas and matched the amount on myself to give to a charity called CRY. When I surprised my parents with all that I was so fucking happy, happiest I've been in a long time. I genuinely want to help people, not just get recognition, but fuck maybe just a little would be nice. I feel.like a dick constantly even though I know I'm not. 

I'll.just end this post here, thanks for reading if you guys did, I really needed to vent and I think this helped at least a little. Yes I have/had a therapist but she's back home and I'm in college so I can't really see her often and the university general therapists are just bad honestly. 

Sincerely thanks for giving enough of fuck to read this far, comments would be nice, just want to talk to someone that isn't my parents repeating the same few points over and over. They love me and care and I love them too but sometimes I just want to talk to anybody but them. Just constantly feel like a burden on people, a couple friends tell me I'm not, I still feel that way tho.

I feel like I'm too self sacrificing sometimes and am gonna be taking advantage of sometime. I kinda am obsessed with Captain America, I think I kinda subconsciously want to incorporate his morals into me, always my favorite avenger. But by just internalizing all.my shitty feelings I may feel like I'm ""saving"" someone else from having to listen to my pain, but over time that's just been damaging myself. I seek the approval.of others so much and I just don't know how to stop ugh

Actually ending it now, thanks for the 5000th time.";Anirudhs98

251;I'm incapable of maintaining friendships and I deserve to be alone, but I know where to start to get better?;5;bi89u8;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi89u8/im_incapable_of_maintaining_friendships_and_i/;2;2019-04-28 03:03:38;"Whenever I relapse, my depression gives me two options: I can either try to keep my friends, but still lose them by lashing out at them, or I can save them the trouble of being in my company and push them out with walls. I've gone through so many friend groups, I think at this point it's fair to say that I'm incapable of maintaining friendships.  


I've found that I've started to repeat certain statements about myself:

*You and your depression are the reason why your friendships end, so there's no point in making or keeping friends.* 

*Even if you let your walls down, no one will want to come in, so don't bother taking the walls down.*

*This is your burden and no one else's.*

&#x200B;

My depressive self loves to obsess over thoughts like those. But I've come to realize that those obsessions are an unhealthy, negative echo chamber that clawed its way into the core of my being through simple repetition. Those thoughts became my mantras. When I'm alone, I repeat those thoughts out loud to myself.  


I may be too far gone, but I'm starting to think that there may be a third option in dealing with my depression: ask for help. I'm incapable of maintaining relationships and the walls I put up and the mantras I repeat are an expression of that truth. But there's something deeply, deeply wrong with that. I can feel it. I can feel it because it's not normal to be this way.  


I'm too far gone to ask for help, but I know those mantras aren't a reflection of my true self. That's where I'm starting. Disarm the mantras. Don't let my depressive self overwhelm my thoughts. Assert my true self in that negative echo chamber. I may not be able to have friends, but at least I can take back my thoughts.

252;Successful on the outside, empty on the inside?;12;bi894z;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi894z/successful_on_the_outside_empty_on_the_inside/;1;2019-04-28 03:00:45;"So, long story short, I was something of a late bloomer in college. Entered with a number of challenges (likely depression, likely undiagnosed ASD, closeted gay person, lack of social skills or work ethic, etc), left having grown in some of those areas and having figured out that I have an interest and a modest amount of talent in a lucrative STEM field. 

10 years on, life looks pretty good from the outside. I’ve had a successful career. I don’t need to worry about money. I’m fit, physically healthy, don’t have any major vices to speak of. I travel a bit, go to art museums, theatre, the symphony, metal shows and all that bougie stuff (I do enjoy it; I realize that it reads like I just do those things to do them). If I put on my social face I’m even fun at parties. Inside, though, it feels like not a lot has changed. I have lots of acquaintances to talk work or specific hobbies with, but maybe 1 or 2 people I’d feel comfortable asking for help if I needed it (or even to dinner or a movie or whatever to catch up). I feel like I never learned how to make actual friends, and I haven’t the slightest idea where to start as an adult well clear of college. I’m fit, but I still don’t like the way I look and that’s led to some destructive behaviors in the past. I can get through social situations and parties with strangers, but at the cost of my brain second guessing my interactions for hours afterwards. 

I wear my normal happy 30-something costume outside, but there’s a bunch of empty spaces and little messes inside where other people have friends, partners, healthy relationships with their career, etc. I try to fill the empty spaces and distract myself from the messes by working long hours, and taking on side/volunteer work that I don’t need (certainly don’t need the money). I like what I do and work in a field where long hours aren’t unusual, but I can’t do that forever.

I had a moment not too long ago while walking to the office. There’s a canal between our building and the parking lot, and a concrete bridge spanning it, probably 30 or 40 feet overhead. It had been a bad week, and 2019 has been a downward slide for my mental health in general. I looked to the side of the bridge while I walked across it, considered what it would be like to go over the edge, and felt a palpable sense of relief. The thought passed in a second, but the moment stuck with me. Not an impulse, not something I’d act on, but maybe a warning or (if I’m feeling morbid) foreshadowing. Clearly something isn’t working (despite my privileged life). I even have ideas about what’s not working. I just wish I knew how to fix it.

I'm currently doing my internship and its consistently getting worse. The workload here is insane, making me stressed beyond my mind... and I think that's contributing to it. (I told my supervisor about my situation, but he doesnt plan to reduce my workload. He just tells me to take it slower.. he is a nice guy, but I guess i didnt explain it well enough)

Additionally, interning makes me wonder if that's really it to life, because it seems like it is. I really want to kill myself at the thought of this. It's so hard to sleep, so hard to do anything.

I saw a doctor on Friday about this and he wasnt friendly about it. Basically told me to suck it up, and wait for my appointment in June.. but how am I able to last that long if it's getting worse by the day...

I'm so lost.. I cant quit this internship because its compulsory for me to graduate..

I cant tell my supervisor that the workload is insane, because I already did..

I cant even see a doctor...

Thus him getting upset and breaking down triggered my brothers suicidal thoughts and now I’m stuck in the middle both sad and vaguely annoyed. 


Where to begin.... so my parents have been out of town and we’ve been watching the house since my brother who was supposed to be watching it went awol. Well he comes back Thursday night. My bf cooks dinner, we all eat and watch tv, than my brother gets up to leave. 

I ask him where he is going since I’m not even sure if he has a license, he’s on probation (whole different story), and he’s driving around with my parents truck. He refuses to answer me. Flat out... he’s never done that before. Well I let him know since he wasn’t feeling well he should stay home (why he was home than anyway), well he talks around it and leaves. I give up hoping he’s alright than go into the other room. Not even a minute later he comes back through the front door speaking gibberish and waking my bf who was sleeping on the couch up. He tells my bf “you’re giving me a tumor. Just stop it that’s not cool. You’re giving me a tumor” and other various gibberish. I point out he’s having a psychosis and he’s lucid enough to agree but when I tell him to stay home he flips and leaves the house saying stay back and shuts and locks the door. My bf goes after him looking for him but he was gone. 

Cut to today. We’ve let a trusted friend know this and we’re able to locate my brother and talk to him and somehow his spirits lift. Well the plan was to have a nice social gathering today making good food and chilling. Wellll my bf has a few too many drinks and begins reeling about his brother who committed suicide and how he wishes things were different. While I’m consoling him my brother is in the other room pacing and talking angrily under his breath while my friend consoles him. End result my brother was triggered because he’s had suicidal thoughts lately and refuses to get help or admit himself to a facility to get help. They’re both asleep on the couch now and my friend who was hanging out has since left. But now I’m stuck in the middle, watching my brother and bf, vaguely annoyed that my brother isn’t seeking help like he should and that he was so nasty and insensitive to my bfs issues (which we’re not directed at him or anyone else but me).

I spent 4 years escaping reality with my favourite bands, and now I feel nothing from the music anymore, I can't listen to my favourite songs, it reminds me too much of the past or a person, and I'm about to give up on playing music.

Now that music isn't helping me the same anymore, I started smoking more, and when it became too much work too get a buzz I quit, not because I care about my body, but because I dont feel like sitting up for a long time to feel anything from it. Then I started smoking weed, and I became dependent on it, so much that I will try to stay high for weeks at a time, but my tolerance is getting high, and I dont have enough money to afford going through so much, so im about to turn to harder stuff, just so I can feel numb and afford it, I know im gonna end up dieing from a overdose, I dream about it every time I fall asleep, and even though I die in my dreams, I'd rather be asleep then awake, but its hard to sleep, music dosen't relax me like it use too, I can stay up for 3 days straight and when I finally crash its only for a few hours.

Im starting to not get hungry as easily, and as much as I know I need to eat, it seems like too much work for me, im only gonna end up eating half a burger before I get full, so why even bother wasteing money and peoples time on it, ill just drink water for a few days until I absolutely need too eat and repeat, im getting skinnier, I feel good not being fat anymore but I know im gonna end up getting too skiny, and not be able to put back on weight.

I’ve had zero breaks from it, and it’s only gotten progressively worse. Nothing anyone says or does makes any impact. I’m willing and trying to get better and have gone above and beyond in my efforts. And it’s like my depression is just untouched. It’s baffling. 

Meds, talking, life events, health, nothing. It all has no effect on my mental state. It’s like it’s so solid it can’t be manipulated. 

Nothing online accurately describes how I feel. Nothing anyone I know has described is even close. 

The only people’s words I’ve found that resounded were from people who killed themselves in the end. 

I don’t know. I just. I feel sick watching all my friends slowly get better or go up and down at least. I’m not going anywhere. Have I just been depressed for too long? 

I don’t see the point in trying anymore, then. I mean I wake up every day disappointed in having woken up. And I go through the day feeling annoyed by everything from trees, to the sound of cars, to the smell of grass. Even things that should be beautiful are so boring to me that I just want to shut my eyes and plug my ears, then throw myself off something. 

It feels like I’m listening to a song I hate, and nothing, NOTHING will make it stop playing, and it keeps getting louder. My skin is crawling and I want this to stop. I’m so uncomfortable all the time. 

I’ve tried so hard for so long. I’m so disappointed. But I’m bored of trying to feel differently. I don’t want to keep trying, but I have no choice. No matter what, I’m existing and I keep waking up and going to sleep. 

I don’t want to die. But fighting this depression is like trying to topple a brick wall by kicking it. I just want to sit down and give up already. It can fall on me for all I care. But why do people always tell me to keep going and not appreciate that I tried? For how long I tried? How hard it is to convince myself to just give up?
I can’t try any harder. 

I just want to stop. I don’t wanna do this anymore. I’m so tired and I’m in pain and everyone just keeps cheering me on. I’m tired. It didn’t work. 

I want to be understood when I finally give up and rest.

I’m very interested in the idea of ending it all. While having a mental break down, I thought about the idea of killing myself, and it was basically the only thing I could think of that would relieve me of this extreme emotional burden.

I sacrificed so much for her. And gave up so much for her. But that's the problem she never asked me too. I dropped out of University, spent all my money on supporting her and taking on our relationships debt. Now I am spending 1500$ a month on debt we accumulated together. 

I'm broken, broke and most of all scared.

I've been on medication for about a year. On some days I feel like the medication is actually working and my life is going to be better. But on other days, no matter what I do, no matter how people help me. Medication certainly made things better. But still. After all this time. All these years of therapy. I still feel strange emotions.

Sometimes I don't feel sad anymore. I am just empty. And it's boring. Every day is boring. I'm just sitting in my room. Not doing anything. Not thinking about anything. Not hearing anything. It's like time doesn't exist. And suddenly it's night time. And then the bad thoughts begin. They take me to a very dark place. 

Sometimes I get angry and I don't know why. I always was a friendly and kind person. At least other people always told me. I never really felt angry. There was nothing to be angry about. But lately I want to scream, I want to destroy things. I would never hurt anything alive. I wouldn't even hurt a plant. But I am so angry and I have nowhere this feeling of anger could go to. Then I feel angry at myself. 

Sometimes, people are not so nice. Sometimes other people feel angry or sad too. Then they tell me things they don't mean. These things hurt me. I know they didn't mean it that way. But I still cry about it. I still tell myself I'm worthless even though that's not what the person meant. I can't stop crying. I feel like a child. I feel Small. Insignificant. I feel like I am drowning in my own tears.

Then, there are the times I feel happy. I sometimes become so happy I cry. I know that happens because of the medication. But I wish those moments would stay forever. I wish I could build a house for these happy emotions and happy times and live with them forever.

And they’ve been super helpful and I’m so grateful for them. But recently my mental health has continued to get worse and I’ve been having more suicidal thoughts and my two friends really want me to see someone for help. And I would but I (18 years old living with my parents) can’t afford to go to a therapist and pay for it and stuff cuz I don’t have my own insurance. So I’d have to open up to my parents about my depression if I wanted to get help. And that scares the shit out of me.

I have a pretty distant relationship with my parents, they’re fine people but we’re just not close and we just kinda have superficial conversations. I’m grateful for everything they provide but I don’t feel any sort of “love” or “connection” to them or any family members. The most important people in my life are my close friends and I value them more than anyone else.

My parents have never been involved in my personal life and the truth is I don’t want them to. I’d honestly be ok if I just left home and didn’t really see them again. I don’t hate them I just don’t feel any relationship. But if I want to see a therapist I have to open up to my parents about my problems.

303;I need any advice I can get;2;bi723e;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi723e/i_need_any_advice_i_can_get/;4;2019-04-28 00:21:48;"I dont know if some parts of this pertain to this sub, so sorry in advance.

So over the past year or two, my brother has been a handful with my parents. Were both in high school, and he has been struggling. He is angry all the time, and depressed, and he causes problems and my parents are always trying to help him but he just keeps pushing them away and doesnt want to get better. He rarely goes to school and argues with them all the time. They always have their hands full, and I dont have a problem with that I want him to turn his life around too, but it's not looking very good. They are very stressed and it's horrible watching them have to constantly try to set him for success and then he just does nothing with it. They are on their tipping point.

The main problem is that my mental state has been getting worse and worse from this. I dont want to say anything to them because itd push them over the edge. I am rarely happy. Months ago I used to wake up and be almost on the verge of tears. My heart would sink every morning realizing this is my life, and theres no way out. When I was alone, I would sometimes cry for no reason. There was an underlying tone of despair and it became second nature. Fast forward to today. Somewhere along the line it became different. I dont feel much anymore. I dont feel anything when I look at my friends and family. It's just blank. Even when I'm sad its dull. I dont really even know how to describe it, but it's kinda like I'm always neutral. Things that would normally make me happy, like playing games and talking to friends just dont feel the same as they used to. I dont know what's wrong, or even if anything is. I'll have to be honest for you to get the full picture of what's happening, but the only time I really feel anything now is life threatening or stupid. Climbing tall buildings, smoking, stealing, etc. Now something that really scares me: the thought of killing someone. Now one part of me says I would never do that, but a smaller part doesnt really know? The thought of doing it doesnt make me feel sad, guilty, or good and happy either. I cant find or think of a situation that makes me come out of my neutral, and feel something. I dont know what to do.

I dont care about my life anymore. I used to be a little suicidal before but I never acted on it. Now the only thing holding me back is my parents. They've basically given up on my brother and I'm their only other child. I wont kill myself while they're alive,for their sake, but if they die then I dont know what'd hold me back. I'd either kill myself, or live the way I want. I would ditch school and live off the land or something, and thinking about that is the only thing I can find solace in. No responsibilities, and no one relying on me. At the beginning of writing this I was trying to find advice, but now I'm just writing what I am thinking. I cant find joy in life, and the thought of life in general makes me not want to be sober. Drugs and sleep are my favorite things, because they are the only things that disconnect me from who I am.

Sorry for anyone that actually read the whole thing. I dont even know what part of this I need advice on anymore. I kinda just wanted to put my thoughts into words. I dont know how to finish this atrocity, and I know I'm going to regret posting this.";throwaway16306

I don't really care about anything nowadays. I'm currently in medical school, don't really care about it.

Nowadays I can barely play for an hour before I'm bored outta my mind. I used to want a relationship, don't really care about that anymore.

We were basically made for each other and it didn't work out, what hope do I have for other relationships? None.

On the weekends, If I'm not going out to drink or to some party or whatever, I sit at home doing absolutely nothing unless I absolutely have to do something else, like a chore or work or whatever. The only thing I still care about is driving. It's calming and satisfying, and I always feel better when I step out of a car than when I entered one.

I often drink and drive. When I'm drunk I'm still a better driver than half the people who have licenses, but maybe someday I'll crash my car and die. I often think that would bring me peace. Maybe I'll even do it on purpose. Would be nice to die doing the only thing I still enjoy.";Rodrikkonen

“Ive been depressed for a long time.”  
But i could not. I could not say it. And everytime id get serious thinking would, i just laughed, bc it was so absurd that i couldnt talk. It was a horrible laugh, painful and it tore at me inside and I realized I was a coward.

Depression has had control of my life ever since I was a child. Strangely enough, I can pinpoint the moment when it started. I was nine years old. I got bullied fairly regularly at school for being overweight, having gap teeth, curtly hair, etc. I'd complain to my parents who eventually transferred me to a new elementary in hopes of getting me away from it. Things were marginally better, but the bullying still happened. One day, a boy was being particularly mean about my weight. I told my teacher, hoping she'd make him stop. What happened instead was she waited until she'd given a reading assignment (and the classroom was dead silent) and pulled me over to her desk. She lectured me about eating habits and exercise. She told me as long as I was overweight people were going to be mean to me. The class, who could obviously hear the entire exchange, struggled to stifle their laughter while every shred of confidence I had in adults was dissolved away.

&#x200B;

That moment was traumatizing for me. I never went to a teacher or my parents for help again, afraid I'd be lectured and made to feel worse about my body than I already did. The first year of middle school, things got far worse. There were more kids to make fun of me, new jokes to be made. Eventually, things got physical. They'd pull my hair, throw textbooks at me, take turns walking by and stabbing me with pencils after going to the front of the class to sharpen them.

&#x200B;

My mind turned black with overwhelming self-loathing. I'd beg my parents to let me stay home. There were screaming matches. My dad would drag me out of bed by my hair or spray me with spray bottles to wake up. I felt like they hated me. The kids at school hated me. More than anyone, though, I hated me.

&#x200B;

I was ten years old the first time I tried to kill myself. I took handfuls of whatever pills were in the cabinet. I don't remember what they were. Probably just pain relievers and vitamins. I just knew that's what the people in the movies did, and I didn't want to wake up and go to school ever again. But obviously, I did.

&#x200B;

Things got worse before they got better. When I started self harming, my parents freaked and put me in therapy. Being cornered by adults was my worst fear, and I still remember the dozens of appointments I sat through as painstakingly tense. The therapists talked. I sat, staring at the patterns in the wallpaper or the lint on the couch. 

&#x200B;

Before high school was over, I had a massive emotional break. I told my parents I was going to kill myself. They took me to the emergency room, not knowing what to do. I didn't talk to the doctors there, either. I wasn't admitted. A few days later, I came close to attempting again. I chose a hair dryer and a sink full of water this time. Just as I was about to go through with it my mother called me for dinner, so I turned it off.

&#x200B;

High school was marginally better in some ways, and worse in others. I learned to straighten my hair, to line my eyes so they didn't look so beady. I dressed better. I got my braces removed that year and no longer had a gap. The depression was still there, but now I had friends. I also had drugs and drinking to distract me.

&#x200B;

When I was fourteen, a man tried to rape me while I was walking to school one day. It was seven-something in the morning. I'd seen him walking on the other side of the street but didn't pay attention. My earbuds were in and I was thinking about what friends I'd see, what mischief we'd get into. He came up behind me and held a knife to my throat. He told me not to scream. He put his hands all over my body, pawing and grabbing, right there on the sidewalk in front of house after house. He dragged me behind a camping trailer somebody had parked in their front yard and told me to take off my clothes. I ran. I got to school, found my friends. I broke down. They took me to the office, they made me tell. Principal, security officer, cops, police station, detective. Swabs. Repeating what happened, again and again. The entire thing felt so surreal. When I was talking to the detective I confused the streets he harassed me on. Whens he pulled footage from traffic cameras, it didn't show him there. She lectured me about why it was wrong to lie about rape. About how thousands of innocent men are charged under false claims. For a second, I wondered if I'd hallucinated it all. The second passed. I knew I hadn't.

&#x200B;

Somebody told the press, or the press listened to the police scanner. On the front of the paper, on the 6:00 news: High School Student Sexually Assaulted. The next day at school my friends gave me handmade cards, like my dog had died or it were my birthday. On the way home, two boys followed behind me and screamed ""rape!"" while laughing and cracking jokes.

&#x200B;

My education stopped at ninth grade. I attended until the year I was supposed to graduate but failed every year as I only went to meet up with people and see who was willing to skip class and get inebriated. There were run-ins with police, plenty of citations, a summer on house arrest, a few trips to juvenile detention. I hated every second of sobriety I had to endure. The only thing that mattered was escaping my mind.

&#x200B;

At sixteen, I was hospitalized for a psychotic break. Too many drugs, no sleep, and no food. I didn't know what was real and what wasn't.  I believed insane things. I seen insane things. They had me on enough anti-psychotics to kill a horse and I'd still be talking to people that I thought lived in the walls. It took a long time to get better. I was hospitalized for a month, but it wasn't until several months after that I started to come around again. I remember my vision being completely fucked. I couldn't read or write for awhile. My sister had to read my birthday cards to me.

&#x200B;

At seventeen, I had nothing. My entire circle of friends was severed. I studied for my GED and got it after I turned 18. At 19 I learned how to drive. At twenty, I tried to kill myself again. I can't count what attempt it was, but it was the one in which I'd came closest. Two bottles of sleeping aides in a belly full of vodka. It wasn't my first time overdosing on sleeping pills, so I knew the hallucinations would come. I was laying there, trying to drift off to sleep and ignore my body's gut instinct to move - fight - live. I had a vivid vision of rolling over and throwing up. Expelling the pills. Undoing it all. I opened my eyes, went to stand, and I couldn't. I could barely sit. I called my parents on my cellphone for help. Back to the hospital, back to the psych ward. I didn't realize it was father's day. I wouldn't have done it on father's day if I had known.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I got a job in retail. From there, I went into cosmetology school. I made friends again for the first time since I was 16. At 24, I fell in love. A girl I met online. The only person I'd really ever told everything to. I drove 13 hours to meet her as friends, and a few months later I drove back to live with her as her girlfriend.

&#x200B;

She said she understood mental illness, but she didn't. It's okay. I don't blame her. Depression is hard to love. She used to pet my hair when I cried at night, refusing to tell her why I was sad (because I didn't *know* why.). I miss that. I miss that so much. But things got worse. I stopped getting out of bed. I stopped eating. My mom had been diagnosed with cancer, and I was 13 hours away, unable to be there. She had half of her lung removed on my girlfriend's birthday. She was on the operating table, I was at a concert. I hated myself.

&#x200B;

Eventually, things broke. I left my ex. I came home. Back to my childhood bedroom. I was broke and heartbroken. I found out my ex had been cheating on me throughout the duration of our relationship, and I thought about dying again more seriously than I had in a long time, but things were too fucked up now.

&#x200B;

My mom's cancer came back. My sister was outed as a heroin addict, and shortly thereafter disappeared with her five year old son. If I die now, how long would it be until my mom went, too? If they find my sister, will she be alive or dead? If she's a live, would she be better off dead?

&#x200B;

I think about the hell I've put my parents through and more than ever, I hate myself. I've been a terrible daughter. I wasn't here when they needed me and now I'm here when they don't. I'm 26 and in no world would I be able to move out on my own. I work at a salon and recently had my hours cut. I was making less than 2 grand a month prior to the cut. My wages are being garnished because the default on my student loans lapsed. My car needs a $1,500 repair and I can't afford the deductible. I'm struggling. I'm depressed. And I can't die. I can't leave my parents, no matter how much I want to. And god, do I want to.";melowhirl

But I was high functioning. I had As in my classes. I had friends and was social. Everyone around me thought I was smart and healthy and full of potential. And hey - maybe I never knew a moment where I didn’t feel trapped with an intense hatred for my existence despite all the positive things around me, but at least I could be proud of the fact that I looked like I had my shit together. 

And then there came a time when I knew I couldn’t hold it together on the outside anymore. And I only knew one way to stop the hurting. So I figured - best to end it now while everyone still thinks the best of me than die later when everyone is disappointed that I never lived up to their expectations. So I dropped my little sister off at school, cleaned the entire house, wrote an 8 page long suicide note and downed a bunch of pills and some rubbing alcohol. 

And then my dad called. Because my sister needed to be picked up from school. And she had been texting me. Asking me to come get her. And I didn’t know what to do. 

So I called the police. 

And here we are, three years later. And I was right. 

I can’t hold it together anymore. I am a disappointment to everyone. And now, instead of having their respect, I just have their pity, their anger, their lack of understanding, and their worry. 

And I wonder what was the point of it all? The mental hospital and the psychiatrist and the therapy and the “being open and honest about my feelings,” and the medication that everyone told me was going to make me better. Because I’m not better. Because everything I thought was going to happen now that I can’t keep it together on the outside anymore, DID happen. And everyone keeps acting like it’s somehow better because I’m still alive, at least. I don’t feel any better than I did, and my grades are trash, and my friends think I’m toxic, but “it’s a blessing” that I’m still alive. 

I would do anything, to go back, and have just died. 

Even though if we’re being real those pills and rubbing alcohol probably would’ve just made me sick because I can’t even do killing myself fucking right. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know wtf I’m supposed to do when nothing is helping.

321;My depression is creating a strong internal conflict as of late (Warning Long Ramble);2;bi66hw;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi66hw/my_depression_is_creating_a_strong_internal/;0;2019-04-27 22:38:56;"Warning: Rambling stream of consciousness. Not really able to collect my thoughts in a coherent way right now. Tl;dr: FML

I'm a 40ish guy. I've suffered from depression for over 20 years. I also suffer from anxiety around groups of people, though this only really came about in the last 10 years. A few years ago, I sought what help was available for someone of my limited means (i.e. American relying on Medicaid). This entailed counseling, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin. We tried a bunch of other meds before those, but those are the ones that I've been on for a couple years.

My anxiety has, until recently, been non-existent thanks to the meds. Though as most here probably know, depression is a lot harder to treat medically, especially when you've got an anxiety disorder that would be made worse by certain types of mood altering drugs.

Counselling was of limited help because I just couldn't follow through on the behavioral changes recommended. I just can't get out of bed some days. I'll wake up, go drain the snake, and then I just don't have the energy to do anything but go back to bed. Housecleaning and sometimes even hygiene suffer because of my extreme lack of energy.

I've put on a ton of weight in the last 10 years, which makes it a sweaty chore just to walk a few blocks, and I've gained a lot of random aches and pains. It also limits my clothing options, given my financial situation. I've made a couple pairs of jeans and some t-shirts and hoodies last a lot longer than they've had any business lasting, by just being careful not to machine wash them unless necessary.

I'm no stranger to contemplating suicide, I've been doing that for years. I've avoided doing so, despite having access to drugs that would make it incredibly easy and painless. While many family members have passed in the last 15 years or so, there are still some left who would be upset by my death. I particularly worry about my disabled mother who in addition to a physical disability has an anxiety disorder that she doesn't properly take care of, due to, ironically, anxiety about adjusting medication she's been on for ages.

My mother would certainly be upset at my suicide, but wouldn't she be just as upset to see me wither away or end up freezing to death in a homeless camp? In addition, I am a financial burden. I can rarely work, and am eligible for very little aid as I have been rejected for disability claims. (Depression isn't a real disability, apparently.) So I'll borrow money, or go to my mom's place for meals. I can't afford to fix my car that broke down and I no longer have phone service, just a cell phone I can use to dial 911 if necessary.

Anyway, the last year or so I've just become so detached from reality. When I do go outside, or do anything that breaks from my routine, it just doesn't feel real. It's sort of like a dream, and I barely remember it afterwards. There's no anxiety on the rare occasion I do go out and about, on the contrary, other than my knees or feet aching, I don't feel anything at all.

I've started to get anxiety when I'm at home, by myself. That used to be the one thing that would never cause me anxiety. But now I just can't get out of my own head. I've got two competing thoughts that leave me in limbo. I don't want to kill myself, really. If I really wanted to, I think I would have done it by now. But I also know that I don't want to live. I don't want anything at all really. I have no dreams, ambitions, or goals. Sometimes I find myself in the kitchen making a mustard sandwich and I'm overcome with a sense of frustration at nothing in particular, just fatigued by existing. The kind of feeling where I just have to close my eyes and take a few breaths to keep from punching something, and then it passes. I can sometimes distract myself watching television, or playing a video game, but those don't hold my attention for very long. 

Recently if I'm not asleep, I'm sitting here with a knot in my stomach because of this impasse I am at where I can't seem to get the will to live, and I can't seem to get the will to die. It's like that sinking feeling I would get for a few days after a break up or something back when I was younger and dating, only it doesn't go away.

I'm starting to think that I'm doomed to sit here and slowly wither away until I die of old age, illness, or some situation relating to homelessness, if I end up that way. I feel like I'm dying an incredibly slow death that I can't reverse or get even accelerate.

I don't know what I expect any of you to say. I just needed to say this stuff because I have no one to talk to. The only friends I have contact with these days don't really understand what I'm going through, because they don't have my issues or are too young to know what's its like to have all these issues AND have half or two-thirds of your life behind you with nothing to show for it. And my family members, well-meaning as they are, just make things worse when I talk to them about it.

Depression makes you hate everyone that is happy 
Makes the world go by slowly 
Feels like there’s an elephant hanging off every part of your body 
There’s no joy in anything you do
Either makes you stop eating or you eat more
Makes you feel lonely even if someone is right next to you

I had interests, things to talk about, and I enjoyed meeting new people. I used to be hopeful for the future. Now, I can't seem to find any enjoyment in life.

I lost all my closest friends at the end of 2018. My girlfriend left me in February. I can count on one hand the amount of friends I have left, but I can't even seem to enjoy being in the moment with them anymore. I'm unwanted because I don't provide an enjoyable experience to those around me anymore. I'm 28 and all I do is work. I like my co-workers, but I can't connect with them either.

It's hard to meet new people after those school years. I want to get out there and take a class or something that will lead me to meeting new people, but I don't have any interests anymore. What's the point anyways? So I can sit in a corner and not talk to anybody like always? Nothing gets me going. I bought a motorcycle last month hoping it would make me feel better. It doesn't.

I don't get myself, so it feels like nobody gets me either. It feels so lonely, and I feel so empty. I've tried seeing a therapist. He asked me to explain what I mean when I say I can't connect with anybody. I couldn't answer him. I feel like I'll never be able to truly express what's in my head, and that this feeling is doomed to stay inside me forever. It's really frustrating. Even as I'm writing this, I'm struggling to feel like I'm really putting my feelings into words. Lately I've been contemplating suicide more often than I'd like to admit. It seems like the only chance I have at making this feeling go away. It feels like the only way I can express this feeling of disconnection is to literally disconnect from life itself.";Throwitallaway73734

Now at 19, being able to reflect better and going through new experiences, I seem to have caused my own moments of sadness. So, really, no one else to blame but myself. Though, It's almost like I force myself to be sad. I've even experimented and did things that would upset my parents- sure enough if feel bad (yeyy an actual reason) but recently, I feel nothing. They say I take then for granted, which I have. But that only confirms I am ungrateful and self centered. It's better that I know I did it to myself. 

I can easily choose to do nothing when I'm home and it usually won't bother me. I leave my room a mess all the time and get overwhelmed when I do try to clean. I've cut out close friends because I don't like who I am around them, a bitvh or just judgmental. I know that everyone goes through insecurities and hardships- but I feel like it's so petty and self absorbed that there's really not much of a point talking about it. Plus it only brings other people in a low mood or seem like I'm asking for attention- I've definitely gotten better at when to bring up how I feel and to whom. (side: this is a bit counter intuitive but I also never know how I really feel? How am I so passive but also sad? When somone asks me how I am I just say fine, but also feel empty and have empty conversations that feel like I'm on auto pilot)

I know I have it in me to change and be better according to my own standard... But I also choose not to. Regardless of where I am in life, I feel like I will never truly be okay or happy with anything.

It’s like a divider in between the real me and the social me. But whether I’m at school or home I just have a sense of not belonging. 

Schools where I notice it the most. While I’m mostly liked I just have a sense I’m not really friends with anyone. I have this sense of not belonging and it makes me say stupid stuff. Maybe it’s just nerves, or maybe I’m just antisocial but this can’t be normal and it makes me so angry and confused I’m not sure what to do. 

My own family I feel distanced in some way. It’s like I’m there but I’m not really there. I feel like I’m not even accepted as a family member, I’m like a guest everyone’s nice to.

I apologize for letting this out here of all places, but my friends don’t listen. I’m at the age where everyone says how depressed they are so no one takes it seriously anymore. They laugh it off.

Also, I am very drunk, so perhaps I won't make sense. 

I know how to act in order to function well in social groups, as well as professional environments to grow. I'm not socially inept. I know what I should do to improve my life and solve my issues. Many are depressed because of their life situation (as am i), and realistically nothing anyone can SAY will change my life situation, only my actions will make any difference. That's why I don't bother speaking about my issues. 

I really don't believe for one second that anything anyone can say will solve essentially anyone's depression, there isn't a set of words that will physically change your life situation, only action. But even sometimes i get swept by people's words and platitudes, like I'm here for you, things will get better, the next day can be better than the last, you have things to look forward to, ""you're being negative, you need positive mindset, don't have a negative mindset. don't focus on the negatives"". To me all these words are worthless. I refuse to avoid my issues by not thinking about them, or by pushing them to the side of my mind and doing things to avoid thinking about them, I think that's weak of me, and just running. I don't want to be someone who just forces themselves to ""be positive"", and just listen to the platitudes that people speak to pretend that they care and understand and think will make you feel better.

I know what I should do. Words don't mean much in reality. I'm not stupid enough to believe that because you can spout platitudes that you truly care, or understand. If you're unable to feel happiness by yourself you wont ever be happy. (My situation). Honestly, I'm not quite sure what I am trying to say. But it gets worse, and worse.";themuph

Ever since grade 2 I've been chasing girls and getting depressed when things dont end well. 

Of course, it didn't get that bad until I reached the sixth grade and became suicidal. I told my mom it was because if my abusive father, which was part of it, but it was really because the girl I had a crush on didn't like me.

In grade 9, I dated a girl for about a month before she broke up with me. It felt terrible, but I'm over it now and she is pretty much my only friend at the moment after she reached out to me a month or two ago.

In grade 10, I dated a girl for about 9 months before she cheated on me. We then broke up and got back together 3 times before I finally told her it was over. That was when things started to go down hill. I started hurting myself a lot more than I ever had, and the following month I dated and was broken up with by two different girls.

In grade 11, I met a girl in my computer science class who I started talking to and eventually we began to date. She was the first girl I ever really loved. After about 3 months of dating was when I realized this and told her over the phone, my heart was racing and every second she didn't say anything felt like a year. She told me she loved me back, and that was probably the peak of my life. She's the type of girl you take home to your mother and tell them that she's the one. 2 months later, we were hanging out, and she asked me what she thinks of our future. I told her I think I would like to marry her one day, and that was when it started to turn to shit. She told me she didn't think she was going to be with me that long, and I left her house in tears. I started walking to the local water tower because I was going to jump off, but I called my friend and she talked me out of it. We dated for another month before it officially ended, and I tried to slit my wrist. I ended up in a psych ward for 5 days, the worst 5 days of my life, and was released after I cried to my mother that they weren't doing anything to help me.

And then, I started grade 12. I was still not over my last ex girlfriend, but other things were starting to look up for me. I started running a mental health initiative at my school, and was one of the four editors in charge of the yearbook. I still wasn't over her, but I had distractions to get me through it with the occasional shitty night where I would self harm. By the end of the school year, I had a few people who I could say were my friends, and went to a Canada day get together where I would meet the girl I still love to this day.

That was the first time I ever went on an actual date. We went to Denny's, played mini golf, and I took her home. I leaned in for the kiss and she kissed back. My heart was racing. We went on a few more dates before we considered ourselves official. I knew I loved her after only a month or so. Her family liked me and we both enjoyed each others company. After another month, I told her I loved her

She didn't say it back. Although I was on the verge of tears, I knew it takes time for some people and that she might say it eventually. After another few weeks, we had the call that would almost end my life. She told me we weren't compatible and she couldn't do it. An hour later I sliced my wrist open and watched the blood pur out. After a few hours and I still wasn't even feeling lightheaded and in pain, I just called my step father to take me to the hospital. I got about 8 stitches and went to school the next day.

It was about two months later when I noticed a girl in my new college and started a small crush. But I had already decided that I wasn't going to go for any more romantic relationships so I didn't try anything. Second semester came, and we had more group projects. I had an opportunity to be in her group so I thought, why not? This was a really shitty decision in hindsight. I found out she had a boyfriend and was a little upset but it wasn't a huge thing. She added me on snapchat which was a surprise but I didn't think much of it. 

I had been clean from self harm for a little while, but that was before I found my recent ex on tinder. The girl I loved had moved on, and it killed me. I then sliced open my leg and posted one of my depressing pictures on my snapchat story. This new girl answered it and asked if I was okay. 

For the past month, she has been the only solid thing in my life, and I began to fall in love with her. 3 days ago, we spent a very intimate night together, sharing secrets and being fairly touchy with each other. I told her I was in love with her and we hugged for what felt like forever. We ended the night very happily and I went to sleep feeling okay. The next morning I sent her a snapchat about something we had talked about the night before. Turns out, her boyfriend opened it and everything went to shit. 

She told me she couldn't talk to me anymore, and blocked me on everything. I stayed in bed for hours, crying my eyes out.

She promised she wouldn't leave.

She said it every day.

She left.

Yesterday, I hung out with my only friend and cried to her for hours, then drove home. On the way, I called my ex. It's been 7-8 months since I heard her voice. We talked about our family and school, and she left to go back to her friends. The moment she got off the phone, I fucking sobbed. I could barely see where I was driving but some how made it home. 

I spent the late hours of last night researching ways to kill myself, and narrowed it down to two options: ventricular fibrillation from electrocution, or liver failure from acetaminophen. One is quick, the other is slow.

I dont want to die and not be able to say goodbye to everyone I've ever loved, but at least the pain would be over.

I dont want to die slowly and realize I really have a reason to live but its too late, but I also dont want to die knowing no one I loved even cares.

I'm afraid. 

And I hate it.";Kingaaron2000

I also am no longer going to the local bar that has felt like a ""safe haven"" for the past three years. After being betrayed by several people I thought were my friend I can't tolerate that. 

I feel so alone, I'm never invited out to anything. I'm never asked if I want to hang out. No one ever comes to visit me at home or ever wants to spend time with me. If I don't say anything I'd basically be invisible. Even my best friend never makes an effort and if I didn't drive down every single time for us to hang out I would never see him at all. Sure, he doesn't have a car but he can take a Greyhound to where I live. 

I feel like if I got rid of all my social media that I would simply fade away and no one would really care about me or even want to see if I am alive. I don't have a car at the moment because the one I had the engine died on it so even going out in public isn't something I can do since public transportation doesn't exist where I live. 

I find myself being more and more felt as if I do not matter. My own family doesn't speak to me anymore. I feel like if I died would be the only time people would ever come to see me.";DareDiablo

There’s this aching pain in my left shoulder, and I’m not entirely sure what it is. It’s not too stressing, but an aching pain that doesn’t seem to go away. I feel tired, I always do. Not sure if it’s my sleep schedule, my eating habits, or just my lifestyle; I never felt energetic, not in a long time. I’m sitting at my computer writing this because I have nothing better to do, I’m writing this because it feels like a voice talking back; but of course it is but my own. I’m listening to my playlist seeking comfort, most of it is mellow dramatic depressing songs, but they feel understanding. Most are expressing pain and anguish, a palpable sadness put into words of lyrics and tunes of melody. I enjoy raising the music as it speaks louder, not just in terms of sound, but it hurts more; which feels good. I’m lonely, I feel like none of my friends like me, my family is a disaster and I’m considered the outsider, and my grades are in shambles. Nothing feels right, nothing feels successful. I always sought love, a companion, someone to be there for me; but I’m not a lucky person. Or maybe I’m not meant for it. I tell myself I’m very specific in my taste, that in the future I want someone who has similar interests like video games, anime, and this sort of internet life while still being sociable. I want someone who is out of the norm, capable of profound thoughts and can truly get a good talk from. But in truth, these are all additional things, or things I wouldn’t mind. I honestly just want someone who can be there for me, a person to lean on. I feel so lonely, no one fucking cares; and at this rate it feels like no one ever will. I’m not athletic, I’m not smart, I’m not funny, there is nothing fucking interesting about me. Why would anyone be interested in me, someone who has nothing to offer. I wonder what it’s like to be loved; I wonder what it’s like to love? I just want to end it all, why not. No one would blink the next day if I were to die. Sure maybe a few here and there would be sad, but give them a couple of weeks and it would be back to normal. I’m not causing an impact on anyone’s life or the world, so there’s no harm in taking me out. I’m just an additional piece, unnecessary for the living world.";ThrowAwayAccountMTL

I finally told a guy I’ve been sleeping with for 6 months that I have to stop seeing him because I want more (and he clearly doesn’t) and my best friend moved from the suburbs to the city. Now I feel so, so alone. Everyone has moved out and moved on and I’m stuck with my mom because I don’t have a roommate to move in with. For some reason these two changes have knocked all the hope out of me - I only want to drink and usually fantasize about jumping off of a parking garage while I’m laying in bed. I spent 24 hours in bed because I didn’t want to move or do anything. 

I’ve been struggling with bipolar disorder for years so I’m somewhat accustomed to having ups and downs - but this time feels different. This time I don’t want to get back up, because I know I’ll end up right back down whether I’m prepared or not.

Even when I feel the lows coming, I don’t have a way to ease myself in and out. I reach out to friends and they’re busy. I drink and feel worse. I try to play games I used to like but I just can’t get into them. It’s like I’m bedridden every time my depression comes around.

Medication? Oh yeah I know all about that. Mine is expensive and difficult to get. It’s been years and I can tell it’s starting to have less of an effect on me, but having gone through the trial and error of trying meds I know it will affect all aspects of my life especially work. Last summer I had to cut down my hours significantly due to my mental illness and I can tell that my employer expects this summer to be better.

Therapy? I’ve had plenty. Sometimes it’s nice to vent to someone but there is no “result” in my opinion. It was only helpful when I was unemployed and I needed something to keep structure in my life. Plus, it’s $50 each time, ask yourself how much you would want to spend $50 on an hour of talking if you had other things you were saving up for.

I think part of it is from thinking about how fucked up and superficial this world is. All about money, power, and status. I hate it. I do often tie my self worth to my productivity. Yeah I’m doing well in school, but do I hate it? Yes. It makes me so miserable. But it makes my parents happier that I’m going to college, happier than they would be if I were a barista. Why can’t success be about how happy and content you are with life instead of a title? I know it is for some people, maybe I just have to try to be one of them.

But, instead of being the stereotypical insular being most associate with being depressed i've been a lot more loud and brash and I guess portraying a false persona of a happy and content being.

  
To give it some context, back in June 2016 I moved from the UK to Australia for a 2 year whirlwind working holiday experience. During this I was meeting new people, living and experiencing new places and just generally enjoying the life I wanted to live. Obviously though, all good things come to an end and i'm back home in the UK at 25, living the life I tried to escape.

  
I've got back in the routine, same mates as when I left (good people too, ones I can open up to), but its not the same as it was when I left. I'm older and everyone else has changed. I like to share my stories of my journeys and fun, their's are the same as when I left. I'm back at the same job I had as when I left (not a bad thing, they're a good employer, with good people), but I feel worse than when I left.

&#x200B;

As the more time has ticked on, I think you know what, this ain't just a little phase, this feeling isn't going away. My mates are having kids, falling in love, buying homes, i'm just where I was almost 4 years ago when I left, and I think you know what was it all worth it.

&#x200B;

When I was away I loved meeting new people, sharing stories, having a laugh and enjoying the good times. Now i'm just looking at things and I'm like where has the enjoyment gone...

&#x200B;

Look... I think i'm suffering depression. Not bad, no suicidal thoughts but it still feels like depression. Does this sound like it? I keep trying to talk to Councillors, charities etc but pull out. Most of it is masculine bravado and lack of self confidence. I don't feel comfortable telling people I'm weak. I can tell my friends, but I can't tell my family, as I guess I don't know how and don't want to throw an unstable ship even further off balance. My friends, they understand, but to be honest it's mostly coming through drunken confidence, and I'm struggling with any interaction with the opposite gender, as I'm lacking the connection to want to share myself with people, as my emotion barriers are up.

This is an incredibly long story, with so many minute details that make up the entire situation. I'm in a relationship, have been for going on two years. She has three kids, all close to the same age, all under 10. I'm currently staying at home to watch her kids, while she works. I have a license she does not, she got tired of staying home all the time and I didn't blame her. Figured, we'll figure out you working and then because I have a license I could figure out how I could work. 2 of the kids go to school, the other one is 2, he stays home with me all day. Between when the kids get on the bus, when they get off and when my girlfriend gets home, I don't have time for a job. 2 of the children have the same dad and one has a different father. The father that has the two kids, sees them every other weekend. He's a wanna be rapper. Or something. He just fucks off and smokes weed all day or whatever. He refuses to pay child support. Thinks it's women trying to come after his money. He's a large part Native American as well as his overly racist psychotic mother. Anytime my girlfriend pushes to take him to court for child support she's met with threats of taking the kids away from her because of the native American pull. He doesn't do shit to help out other wise either. Most times we bring the kids there and he drops them off  (45mins 1 way). We live in a shit hole trailer after my scum bag sister, bled dry most of our tax money from us staying with her while on our asses. Our landlord is scum, we had to run space heaters in the winter time to keep the trailer even partially warm. My electric bill is over 3000 dollars in the course of 6 months. Now he's evicting us because we refused to pay him for a shit.hole trailer that we cleaned to move in, in the first place. Even gave him a security deposit. The electric is shot, I've blown multiple OUTLETS. There's no smoke detectors. He has a long list of being a scum.bag and a pedo according to Google. However somehow he always wins in court against his tenants from what I read online. We had 3 days to be out, with three kids. We've contacted every unit in the state and time and time again were denied for not having a high enough income, yet were denied for housing for having too large of an income. Our only options are to; A: Stay in a shelter for 6 months to get a housing pass, B: move into a motel room during the summer (expensive rates) and more than likely tap into our savings if not fully deplete it, or C: Give the father custody in which case he puts the kids on the Native American census, claims them on his taxes (which he was doing before I came along, didn't use any of the money on the kids at all) and basically subject them to a racist family of liars and manipulators. Both of our families are scum, with no interest to help us out unless it includes paying them an absurd amount of money. The only thing we have going for us right now is she was approved for an auto loan so we could build credit. Hopefully the car holds up. In a few days time, I'll be in the hardest position of my life. I grew up living out of cars and motels and foster care. These aren't my kids but I love them like they are. I'm so caught between wanting to give up knowing they're not mine or blowing my fucking brains out with my FN 40. I can't leave them. I can't give up on them. Everyone else has. I don't want them to have a life like mine. I'm tired of getting screwed over, I'm only fucking 24 and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack most days. Anyways.. I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. I think it's selfish anyways, I'd feel bad for my friend, my girlfriend, and the kids. Or maybe I'm just worried no one would remember me. I didn't include all the details, there's so much. Thanks for letting me vent.";GhostAbs0lution

But for some time, we were friends. And yeah, I miss her in a weird way, but it's not about that. It's not about missing. It's about how she so easily forgot everything. 

&#x200B;

We are in the same classroom. So it's not like I can just ignore her existence and move on completely. But she, you can fucking bet she can. I doubt she even remembers my middle name. We ""broke up"" because she never had time for me, I was always the one who had to grow the balls to talk to her in any way (even though she is way more sociable and confident than I am) and we never hung out. And I know this seems to have such an easy solution. Just end it. But it's hard to let someone go when you feel friendless and lonely for days on end.

But I had to. I was being treated like shit. So I did it. And while my head is still with those obsessive thoughts and wondering ""what went wrong"", even though I know what it was, hers is completely healed. She forgot me like that.

I'm a girl with excessive body hair and my life has taken a turn for the worst. My grades are suffering, my mental health is suffering and I feel so ugly. I feel so alone. Knowing that I'll probably never find a guy that will be attracted to me hurts. I avoid mirrors. I avoid showers. I don't go out. I have hair everywhere. I have hair on my hands, belly, chest, face and leg hair that's worse than every guy I've ever met. I also have the hairiest forearms in the world. I honestly have been contemplating suicide because the excessive body hair could mean PCOS. Pcos can barely be treated and my symptoms will only get worse. I don't see the point in sticking around just to see my body hair get worse and see people I love leave me. I don't want to be alive anymore. I hate everything about myself and I have 0 good physical traits. My chest hair is already getting worse.

I would commit suicide if I didn't have people who cared for me. Most of the reason why people care about me is because I hide my body  hair. If they knew how much I have I know they would just leave. I'm sick of everything.

My depressions been bad enough that I became so suicidal I was holding a Glock in my mouth in the middle of the woods roughly 3 years ago. Haven't had a friend since I was a junior in high school and have never had a girlfriend. Even so, I got a new job and have lucked out with who I work with. I don't have any problems with any of them and two of them I may end up considering more friend than acquaintance. It's the first time in years I've had conversations with people and to my surprise have been comfortable with it, if not enjoying it. It appears that they may somehow like me. 

Problem is that the two I've mentioned invited me to go out last weekend outside work for ""fun."" I was shocked and awkwardly accepted the invitation. The invite was last Thursday and we planned to go out that Saturday on an agreed upon time. But in the time between the invite and the outing, I let my thoughts overwhelm me. I couldn't believe that they actually wanted me to go with them. I haven't done anything with anyone but family since highschool. I started thinking that if I actually went they would see more of me and realize that I'm lame and no good to be around. I thought I would ruin their night and that they would regret inviting me. Felt I would be some sort of ""third wheel"" they wished they didn't bring. I kept playing awful scenarios in my head on repeat. I became so convinced that it would actually hurt my relationship with them both that I came up with a lie to get out of it. Ended up saying that I had forgotten about my sister's birthday and that I had to head out of town which was all bullshit. 

This decision has wrecked my self confidence I thought I was beginning to build with this new job and has weighed heavily on my mind. I stayed in bed all that weekend and have been feeling disappointed and sickened by myself. After one bad decision I have been left in the dumps and am struggling to get out of it. It's made me regret once again that I didn't shoot myself those 3 years ago because I'm so pathetic. Has made me realize that it's probably true that I may never make a friend. Which most certainly means I will never have a girlfriend. 

Such a seemingly small stupid decision has brought me back to being angry with myself. I hate being this way. My one opportunity to have a proper social experience in several years has been ruined. It's made it hard to see people happy. Especially when I went to the theatres for the Avengers opening day. I didn't see any others that went alone. Made me feel worthless and sad during  what should have been a purely feel good experience.

It hurts to see people I know exceeding so well, especially when a lot of these people used to bully me to the point of wanting to end things. I just feel so defeated. I have no idea what i'm doing anymore or what i'm going to do. I'm so afraid. I'm afraid that i'm going to end up homeless or not go anywhere. I'm afraid of leaving my dad because he's getting older. I just don't know what to do and it's killing me honestly. I'm so fucking afraid.;Bazz_Lightyear
394;Wanted to share the little things that have helped me tremendously....just in case it could help you too.;33;bi582q;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi582q/wanted_to_share_the_little_things_that_have/;5;2019-04-27 20:51:39;"So I've had depression for about 9 years now. It all started in college for me when my anxiety went through the roof, and then after a couple of years of anxiety depression kicked in hard. I am 30 years old now and through therapy and medication, I was able to find out ways to pinpoint what affected me the most; now I still have depression but its much much more manageable and I no longer take any medicine or see anyone for it. Here are the things that really helped me! Some are simple, but I wanted to list them all; I have found that when depressed, it was very hard for me to actively think about ways to make myself better. Hoping this list can maybe help another as well and also be a reminder for me when I am having a hard time. (Bold for TLDR)

\- **Seeking medicine and therapy** so that I could lower my depression in order to realize what I needed to do to get better was one of the most important decisions.

\- Focusing on making my wife/friends happy instead of focusing on how I was feeling. I have found that when I am depressed I am so focused on myself; **focusing on others** not only made them feel good but it also helped me as well.

\- Going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time was very important for me. Heck...just sleeping is important! Studies have shown that **getting good sleep** alone can be as effective as taking anti depressants.

\- **Limiting actions that gave me temporary happiness** but that didn't make me feel like I accomplish anything or gave me personal growth. Limit living in a fantasy mindset; examples for this are video games, porn, social media, alcohol, phone games, tv shows, etc... When I was very depressed, I tended to live in my mind all the time; switching to focusing on my life, the present, and what I was doing with it was huge for me.

\- Directly related to above, plan your day out and try to do things that do give you personal growth or make you **feel like you accomplished something**. These could be small, they just need to make you feel like you did something good for yourself or another. Making a list and crossing things off of them is one of the best feeling for me! Some of mine example of this are chores, drawing, learning a new skill or language, reading, and some others below.

\- **Exercising** a little bit every other day (even just 20-30 mins). Not only can you meet people this way, it will also give you endorphins, give you energy, and make you feel like you're doing good for your body. Feeling low energy was a big depression problem of mine. (this also falls under accomplishments for me)

\- **Having a dog** helped me a lot, it makes you get out of the house for walks and or dog park; this helped me make friends and also the walk is really relaxing. I have noticed that just **being outside** is good for me.

\- **Eating.** This is a bit of a silly one but I noticed that sometimes I was just feeling down because I didn't have anything to eat in a long time.

\- **Meditate!** I have found that so much of my time when in depression was focused on living in my past or future; meditation made me remember to focus on the now, the present, and really appreciate it.

\- Asking myself why I am feeling the way I am, almost like having a conversation with myself. **Planning out my day** so that I am actively going about doing things that I know will affect me in a positive way was great guidance I was able to receive from a therapist.

\- **Taking care of myself physically**. I am a guy, and I have noticed that making myself dress more nicely and making sure I was well groomed makes me feel good and made a difference in how I went about my day.

\- **Drink lots of Water!** It's amazing how much better you'll feel and how much more energy you'll have just from creating this habit. **Eating healthier** and  trying to **cook at home** is another change I made, matter of fact, cooking and getting better at cooking is another thing I use as accomplishments.

\- Lastly, **focusing on actions instead of emotions.** This one is probably one of the hardest to do when depressed because your emotional mind is dominant over your logical mind, but it is so crucial. **Focusing on what you can DO instead of how you are feeling was a game changer for me.**

&#x200B;

Wow, this is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be but even if 1 of these things helps somebody out there...it will have been worth it to write it all out. Like I said above, I still have crappy days and I am not great all the time, but I feel like I do have much better days than I used to. I would love to read if any of these things were helpful in your own life, or even if you have another suggestion that you feel has made a big difference for you! Cheers!";hcoinreosty

I can't tell whats real, find anything that matters. But I had an awful childhood, it was painful, made me hurt to my core, and now I miss it, I loved that pain, it kept me grounded, gave me something to fight against, I couldn't just get over it, it made me feel special and valued, it gave me purpose, and without it I feel empty, purposeless. I can't be the only one, surely someone knows how to get it back, get my feelings back, get me, I get flickers, remnants occasionally, but I don't remember much, and their gone in a split second.

That\[s about it to my question, unless you wan't to read about what I think it used to feel like. I remember, being afraid, playing with some toys while my mother was sleeping in another room, she wouldn't speak to me for weeks when she got pissed, i felt so alone in that grey old flat, i remembering to pretend the toys where real, how magical i though the dreary sunset outside the corner window was, i think i must have sat there on the floor thinking for hours, because it had gotten dark, i could see my silhouette, but the curtains hadn't been shut, i wanted a better life, for one of those TV characters to whisk me away, i remember feeling so tierd, when those few characters had been used in every scenario imaginable, i just lay them down, realizing it was useless. But it was kinda nice, in-spite of feeling so small and alone, i kind off felt connected to this endless, mysterious world, for no reason i felt as though it was on my side.

I was infantalised with the dark, it was like this teen life, where you'd meet all the cool people, but nice cool people, better people, perfect people, friends, and have these wonderfull adventure and lives, i dont know why i associated that with the dark, and i just belived,with all my heart, id be out there. And even when my mother would be pissed, or horrible or mad at me, i knew i had that dream, that world which felt so real, that she, nor anybody else knew about it, or could get to it. I was listening to a song , and all i did was imagine the lyrics, it was just about kissing my girlfriend on a fence, i was 7 so this was just friendly, but that's all i wanted, someone who would like be for me, that dream, that song, more powerfull than any real feeling.

The songs from the album life in cartoon motion by mika. I'm listening to it now, the whole album's got a lot of depressing songs, only album i had. must have listened to it over a thousand times. There's another song, in any other world, that's all about dying and being part of a show, I thought about that a lot, I wanted to die, because i could never be one of those great people, as good as my dreamed up friends or the cool characters on TV, they where happy, they had people, because to me, that life in the tv, in my dreams was more real, more perfect that this life. And so i thought, maybe if i just died, id get to be with them, but i was 7  so i had no idea how to do that. Anyway, I'm 17 now, tried it alot of times, hardly seems worth it now, TV's lost its magic, don't have dreams, and I know I either heading for nonexistence or eternal damnation.

I’ve had enough of being on so much medication and I’m tying to get off some if not all. Over the last few months stopped the ambien first, then the trazodone (which I replaced with an antihistamine so I have something to bridge the gap). I’m on half the dose of lamictal I was at and I can’t go any lower. I think the cymbalta is giving me some of the worst side effects that I’m trying to stop from happening, but I’m finding it so hard to come off of. I’ve gone cold turkey off of (not intentionally) it before but never for more than 3 days and it was unbearable. I feel extremely dizzy and get tingling and numbness in my face and hands. This also happens if I go lower on my lamictal. My psychiatrist says that if I feel bad without them than I should just keep taking them, so she’s no help. Please don’t fight me on my decision to get on fewer meds, this is something I’ve thought through.

419;Why does everyone care so much about how guys express their emotions?;67;bi4hae;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi4hae/why_does_everyone_care_so_much_about_how_guys/;18;2019-04-27 19:33:53;"(I'm not trying to say men are systematically oppressed or anything because I know that's obviously not true, I'm just talking about one very specific problem I've encountered as a result of being and identifying as male.) 



If I'm literally struggling to feel like I have to reason to be alive why do I need rules for how I can express that? If I wanna cry and listen to Taylor Swift, (*Red* has some of my favorite music to listen to when I'm really upset. Sue me) and that makes me slightly less miserable, anyone should be happy. My parents and sister mostly understand but any other relatives I have including my sisters fiance who I see almost daily think it's so weird that I'm depressed and make that known and try to seek treatment for it. They think men need to deal with it themselves and stay stoic, or if they don't they must be gay. Even my now-ex girlfriend said a few times that I had a ""feminine side"" because she was one of the few people I'd cry or really express myself around. What does that even mean a ""feminine side?"" Being depressed is feminine?



I got in a bad car accident one night a couple months ago during a big fight with my now ex and I broke down crying in the car while I waited for help. The police officer who came asked if I was physically hurt and I said no (thankfully I really wasn't) and he said why are you crying then? And then asked how old I am. Uh maybe because my day is already terrible and then I just spun out into a ditch at 65mph and I'm scared and upset.. Why would the first thing you say to anyone in this situation be a criticism.



Or at work. When a female coworker is having a bad day it's ok for them to express it and I envy that because some days I just feel *terrible* all day, literally not worthy of living and absolutely awful and I just have to be straight faced and casual all day or I'll seem super weird. 




The hardest part of this is that it's impossible to talk about any of my problems with my guy friends, ever. I have a friend that I've literally been friends with for 16 years now and we've never once shared a word about emotions except for anger because that's what men are allowed to feel. Even when I went to the hospital I just said yeah won't be around my phone for a few days, text you after if you need me. The only friends I've ever felt like I could express myself emotionally to have always been female friends but that causes some problems when I end up relying way too much on a few people and that isn't fair to them. My entire support network can't be 3 people when I'm going through this much just because they're female, but otherwise I feel extremely isolated and alone.";Doesntmatter1237

I constantly feel like my friends - the few people that I can actually hold dear - are slowly drifting away from me due to my issues even though I always find myself solving theirs as an act of kindness and care. I’m seemingly always living with the pressure of school and how my success could be the one thing that validates me as a functioning member of society and not the mess that I truly am, I’ve been projected results that’ll send me to these top universities but I consciously know I’m incapable and that I’ll just disappoint those around me, I want to succeed so I can live a good life and so I can possibly incorporate myself back into my family but, again, the prospect of failure nullifies all of those feelings and makes me realise that I’ll never achieve what I want to achieve and I’ll just end up alone once again.

TL:DR - I wanted to be a voice actor but I'm quitting.

For a few years now I've been wanting to do voice acting. It's something that makes me happy. After I was done with speech therapy, voice acting made me even more confident to speak and socialize, as it more often that not makes people laugh. This was 2015. 

Sometimes I would watch panels for the voice cast of my favorite animated series. It always seemed like a blast. Not for just the audiences, but the cast that were at those panels. They always joked and laughed with each other. Then I got the great idea to do that myself, as I was a great impersonator, or at least I felt that way.

Those impersonations evolved into original voices. They made people laugh, even if I didn't know them. Then one day I got to meet Linda Ballantyne (who was Sailor Moon back in the day), and she encouraged me to try voice acting. I was ecstatic. Then I began to get some connections to forums and discord servers, and made friends. I took part in a workshop or two. 

Now I'm out of high school and I have an ableist as fuck dad who's constantly making fun of my career and telling me to stop doing ""kiddie voices"", to the point where I'm about to break out my equipment just to sell it for cash. Sad part is he's the one who bought the equipment a couple years back, happy to see me happy after being depressed for so long. He doesn't care anymore.

I want to be good at something but every try of being better I get stuck at first more complicated milestone and get deeply depressed. I feel different than other people, not fitting into the society but at the same time I can behave normal in social situations. Adults (I'm 16) I meet (teachers, mom's friends) keep telling me compliments like ""oh you're so intelligent person!"" but I can't receive them and think of myself as a person with IQ below 80 or even 70. I try to be nice to people and helpful but every time I tried to help I made things much worse (lately I tried to help my friend with repairing his phone's screen - now the phone does not even turn on). I can't talk to any decent-looking girl without making things too obvious. None of them even want to look at me. I want to not exist but I'm heavily afraid of suicide/natural death. I want to believe there's a God (my mom is Catholic as well as me) but my dad calls my mom devotee. I'm not able to do any physical job, I get tired really quickly. I loose motivation very quickly. My hobbies doesn't last long - after 4 months of doing photography my camera started to gather dust. I can't write a single sentence (both in English and my native language) without any mistakes. I can't express myself. I want to be creative but it's the thing you're born with and it seems like I'm not one of those ""Bob Ross"" kind of people. My old friends think of myself as technological nerd but I know no shit about technology. I complain about every single thing, just like my father. I hate him for no serious reason. My classmates don't want to me even when I start the conversation. I make people bored very quickly.    

I don't understand why people think I'm intelligent because I'm not. I don't want to spend more money on intelligence tests because I know I wouldn't pass them. I was told to go on therapy but I have no money for a person who would really help me. Once I tried cheap therapy - it was one of the biggest mistakes I made. That women made me even more depressed and angry than I was before. I thought I may have Asperger's syndrome but I consider myself being a very empathic person. I can feel other people happyness and sadness and get their guilts on my own back. My mind feels split into two separate people constantly arguing even because of small things.

I've been dealing with depression since I was about 16.

I have overall a very supportive family, who is willing to fund my treatment, friends who truly like me and I am one year away from finish my first degree with above-average grades.

Despite this, despite me seeing a therapist, despite having everyone going for me and being the best I've been in a while, I started either drinking almost every night or smoking weed in the eve before I go to sleep. I really don't want to otherwise, and keep myself up until I'm exhausted just to fall dead asleep.

Everything is going well. I have literally nothing to complain about. The worst is behind me, really.

But I can't just... be happy. I'm a decent looking guy, I've had girlfriends and am sociable, but I every human interaction which isn't my close friends is scary. I've been without someone close for a long time.

&#x200B;

I don't even know what I'm typing. It's a holiday where I live and this is my main profile.

I've spent most of it sitting alone, at home, on my computer.

I've been in treatment for years. I am a second year psychology student for fuck sake.

I'm just tired man. I'm tired of this. I'm well overall. Really, I am.

I just want it to be better. I just want things to go easier, this is really hard. It gets easier, but I  can't reach what I want, if that makes any sense. Things feel closer to grasp but still out of reach. I'm not really out, but I'm not really in as well.

Birthdays aren't as big of a deal as we get older. That's fine. I don't need a group of 15 people to come drink with me but I'd really appreciate if anyone made me feel like they give a shit about my existence. This is year 4 of spending my birthday sitting at home alone.

Yea, 8-9 people text me happy birthday. I thankedthem and appreciated it. But it's like posting on someone's Facebook on their birthday. There isn't a lot of meaning behind it.

I thought maybe my closest friend would reach out and want to go to dinner, but she didn't. I've quit trying to ask her to do things because it's always a no, or it's too far from her house, or she has to ask her husband, or I never get a straight answer. I've been really distant towards her and told her I don't really ask her to do things and I feel like I was just being dramatic and I really don't want to make her feel bad but I can only handle rejection so many times or the feeling that it's too much of a burden. I'm not sure I can even remember the last time we did something because it was my idea. And it usually takes me making a comment about how I haven't had human interaction outside of work in 3-4 weeks or a comment about everyone else shooting me down before I get a ""you can come over"" and then it seems it's out of pity. I know a lot of this sounds like I need a new friend but for the most part she's 10/10.

Everyone thought the idea of sitting at home doing nothing sounded like an amazing day but no one understands that's my reality. Every. Single. Day. I get off work. Come home to a roommate I'm not close with at all and hope Netflix has something new that I'm interested in because I've seen it all.

 I've started going to the gym in the last couple years and lost about 50 pounds. Quit drinking regularly because I know these are good things to do when battling depression. I've started taking guitar lessons for a new hobby.

But none of it replaces human connection. I asked a handful of people if they wanted to go get dinner or something. I didn't even have an expectation of them grabbing mine since it was my bday. I just wanted to do something. That's all. But I guess getting someone that I care about to take 60 minutes out of their day to express that they too care about the day I came into existence isn't in the cards for me.";dudebreau

M (17) I don't understand what depression Is. I don't like calling myself depressed because it's what everyone in my school's used to used to get attention and get out of classes. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. 

If you tell people you're depressed, you're either going to be seen as a freak or an attention speaker, and they think just because you haven't killed yourself yet it's not for real. 

If you don't tell people, you are stuck in a hell that you've been stuck in for years and you can't escape. 

Therapy is the obvious answer but I highly doubt my parents would take me or even care if I said I wanted to go. 

So I always wonder am I actually depressed or am I just weak. Or maybe I just get sad really easy. I don't know. I want it to be depression so I can be diagnosed or have some kind of help for fucks sake. I just wish everything went back to how it was when I was a kid and nothing mattered. I just wish everything could go back to normal before everything fucked up and this shit started. I dunno. 

I just don't know if I'm actually depressed or if I can post here because whatever it is, talking about it helps and I wanna do that on here so there are no real consequences.

I've missed your embrace
The daunting eyes
A haunting face

Take a seat
Make it your home
Offer no greet
Just let my mind roam

A happy facade
A mere actor at play
You sharpen your rod
You're happy to stay

Voilent words whilst I ward
The blood starts to run
A slash from your sword
You're having some fun

I reach out for help
But fall to my knees
I cry and I yelp
""Don't hurt me"" I plead

Your Darkness is concealing
You thought you were quicker
I'll fight for my feelings
This time I'll be slicker

A dagger I've found
Time for us to part
With great courage I bound
I aim for the heart

Determined to win
I hit one final blow
I pierce through the skin
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE!

You now lack your strength
I've taken control
As you can not think
Without me at your role";MathIsGod3

Things have gotten better in the past few years but that’s only due to me realizing what me committing suicide would do to my family. I know that they would be devastated and I care so much about them, enough that I’d never want to do something like that to them. However I have nothing in my life, family included that makes me happy enough to want to get out of bed in the morning. I fully believe that my future doesn’t hold anything else besides years more of this and I don’t want to experience it. So now I find myself torn between not wanting to live the life I have, and not wanting to hurt the people who would be affected by my ending it. This feeling came back with a vengeance because I met someone about a year ago whom I fell for because she finally made me happy and actually want to get up in the morning and made me look forward to the future and I thought this would finally be where all the shit I’ve gone through becomes worth it and I can have a future I actually want to be around for, but now I realize I have no future with her, which leaves back where I was before, with even more assuredness that this is where I’ll be for the rest of my life, and I fucking hate it.

TLDR: I have nothing going for me in my life and the only reason I don’t end it all is because I know how it’d hurt people I care about, even if they don’t make me happy enough to live my life. And I’m just really torn on what to do and miserable all around.";RawthonBawthon

In the midst of living in one’s own head the physical health appears to be descending and as to a certain capacity I can not understand. Trying to live just for mere seconds gleefully while listening to the Juliana Barwicks of the world. And still having the itch to scan ideas like trans humanism and a one day painless paradise on the earth seems like one gigantic pipe dream similar to Christian Universalism.

He has a tremendous amount of negative feelings about himself, where’s he’s going in life, his job, him not being the kind of dad he wants, not knowing his father, not being close to his family and then us splitting up. 

He called my sister about a month ago and it was a night we got into a fight. He had  a gun in his hand and didn’t know what to do. I’m so very fortunate that he contacted someone whom happened to be my sister and she answered because who knows what could have happened if not. I really want to be there for him in any sort of way I can but I don’t know what I can do and what would actually help vs what would annoy him or make him feel worse. 

I certainly don’t want to push him away or make him have anymore depressing thoughts. He’s not one to ask for help or even communicate how he’s feeling at all. He will hide every bit of it for as long as possible and jokes about killing himself and not having a dad on a regular basis. It was a long process for him to even get into therapy. My sister suggested he also see a psychiatrist which I agree may be helpful. 

He has had suicidal thoughts off and on but I truly don’t know how close he’s come to attempting anything besides a month ago. I am extremely concerned no matter how serious the issue but I don’t know where to begin. If anything happened to him I don’t know what I’d do...I too also feel like I have a slight depression but I can usually snap myself out of it so maybe I don’t. I don’t know. 

His therapist now said he showed 11/15 signs of depression and she wants him to get on antidepressants and he is 50/50 about it. He doesn’t want to take them but he doesn’t want to be depressed either. He knows if he takes them and then stops, it’ll make those thoughts worse and I really don’t want that. Some insight or experiences with anything similar would be greatly appreciated!❤️

This affects him on a day to day basis, hates his job, sleeps in/naps often, goes to the gym, doesn’t always eat well..etc...";SatisfiedPeach

I bring it online, and I'm found as a toxic fuck. I'm found as an asshole, a troll. But I'm not. But it's up to you to decide.

Anyone scared that what they have to say isn't valid on this sub, or that it's already been covered somewhere here and im just a broken record? Or when you see a post that really helps you feel better, and then you see it was made a day ago, people have already commented, yada yada yada, you go to comment and you litterally cant think of anything. I don't know, maybe I just can't think because of my depression. I'm a very lonely useless idiot and I know I sound like everyone and I know noone will see this, but it just hurts. It really just hurts from all angles when I wanna meet some of you people privately because you're comforting me when I'm lonely but I really just can't bring myself to do it. I'm too antisocial, even in this subreddit. I wish I could be happier and not fucking feel jealous of all the attention those people get because I want attention and to be loved too. I'm always the one helping others, and even though being online is the only place that I can really be my messed up jagged self people never accept me ot the think I'm toxic or they think I'm an asshole. It's all drama shit sure, but it hurts cos I'm sensitive. I feel over pressured because as a kid I was actually a brainlet in school.  (I.e. in 4th grade I said the full n word to a black kid cos it the it's be funny;I also wanted to stab someone else. The school I was in had to create a new form of punishment, just for me, that would suit my ""needs"". And now I'm here, fucking trying to feel something or heal or something other than this useless sack of shit that I always have been. One might think that I shouldn't be able to be self aware of my being a useless sack of shit because I wouldn't be able to detect change. But I seriously can't continue anymore and it's just all getting to much. I wish I could make a post that wasn't fucking incoherent and just a fucking ramble. I'm sorry I'm so fucking insecure. I'll never get better because I've been trying for fucking years to redo what society thinks of me. But society hates me, everyone is fake, and we have to eliminate any trace of ourselves (be anonymous online) to be ourselves. We're such a stupid dumb species as a whole and I genuinely hate everything. 

I'm sorry that I ranted, I just couldn't fucking take it anymore. The loneliness. The silence. I could go to my friend's but they're both just being depressed like me, one got dumped by the guy that made her aromantic to romantic, another is just dealing with her own problems (which I partially helped spawn.) I'm sorry I just can't deal with this pain anymore. Even if noone sees this, even if this is just lost in the space of this sub, I just needed to put this out there. I just feel like my depression and social anxiety gets aggravated when I try to comment on this sub. It's very hard to contribute or something. Idk, my mind is to dead and tired for me to think of anything. If you actually read this and you want to to contact me, please feel free. I could use a conversation... Sorry if I don't trust you even then... I'm a hard fucking nut to crack. Sorry I ranted again here, I'll be on my way now. I just feel apathetic and empty and I want someone to hold me with their words. Noone really cares enough, at least right now - including myself, I'm not writing to a professional or whatever. As I have always done. I'm just tired and I'm gonna listen to one my favorite songs. It'd be nice to meet you thank you for reading.

About me:

Name: Tyler

Location: San Diego

26M, physically fit, well paying job/career track. I'm a pretty quiet and ""chill"" guy, not super antisocial, however I prefer my close group of friends to the bar/party scene, classic introvert I guess, but very amiable once a dialogue is started. Always been the 'artist type', but have not really been able to explore or express it in my adult life.

(Not being vein, just for context) I'm told often that I'm very bright, and attractive, unfortunately my self-worth and confidence is absolute zero, so I take these compliments as falsities.

On paper it should seem like I'm doing great. I am not.

Tried killing myself 7/4/2018. Like really tried, I was physically stopped by my girlfriend. She snuck up on me and pulled me off my balcony (noose around my neck).

Prior to that my last suicide attempt was at 12yo. Due to my young age, I find it hard to recollect if I really wanted to go through with it, or if it was just an outburst. Regardless, this has been my reality.

I've never once imagined my end by any means besides my own hands. Thats the way it has always been. This scares me.

I've only opened up about this to a couple friends, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I know I've been caught in the ""Pull yourself up by the boot straps and be a MAN!"" trap. And believe me, I've tried and tried and tried and tried. Now I'm just so fucking tired. I guess I always thought I my sadness was situational. Molested at 6yo, homeless from 14-17yo, straight into the workforce to provide for myself after that.

It wasn't really until my failed hanging that I took a step back and realized that while some of the great sad could be situational, primarily, its just the way my brain has been wired.

It's almost freeing in a way, but also very scary. As of now, I can say with absolute self belief that I will take my life before the end of this year (waiting till I hit 27). But, in the same breath, I can also say that I reeeeeeallllly want to try to change my brain so the previous statement can be relegated to foolish past thoughts.

I'd love to try Ketamine Therapy, but I work full time, and it is very costly. I realize that while this is true, it is also an excuse to not to it. I'm damned good at that.... but for real that shit is very expensive :/

Beside that, actually rather than Ketamine, I'd like to do a psilocybin micro-dosing protocol.

I'm currently spending a shitload of money buying a bunch of natural mood boosters off of Amazon, I've felt minimal improvement at most after a couple months, but half this shit makes me nod off while driving home after work, seriously almost had a handful of head-ons lol.

&#x200B;

I do have ambition, goals, and ""plans"". I do have discipline. However, my drive and will are near non-existent. Obviously it's mental, but it feels soooooo physical to me know. Walking around during work (construction), I feel weighted down immensely, just so drained all the time.

&#x200B;

Apologies for the long post,

471;This is my first week after being released from behavioral health.;2;bi2o0t;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi2o0t/this_is_my_first_week_after_being_released_from/;0;2019-04-27 16:31:53;"I spent most of last week in the behavioral health unit after having the cops called on me. I've been struggling with depression most of my teenage years and now into my adult life and I neglected it for so long that I was involuntarily admitted for reasons I'd rather not dwell on.

It was a really great experience being on the unit and I met a lot of great people. I've been set up with antidepressants and a great counselor. 

When I left the unit I felt absolutely on top of the world. The physical feeling that usually was deep in my chest that made me feel constantly sick was gone. I really thought that I had somehow been miraculously cured and would never have to deal with it again even though saying that now sounds extremely naive. 

I've felt myself slowly declining since leaving the unit and I feel like today is my first bad day. The disgusting feeling of hopelessness is very real again and I feel sick. 

My girlfriend had broken up with me right before I was sent to the unit and that has been very hard.  We were together for 3 years. She was my support system and I feel very hopeless without her. I also feel very hopeless for the future without her. She was everything I could ever want and being with her felt more natural than being alone. I don't feel like I have days to look forward to anymore without her, we did so many fun things together and we were just starting to travel together. 

We have spoken since and she seemed hopeful for our relationship being mended with time. She emphasized needing space more than anything and that is what is keeping me awake at night. I want so badly to reach out to her and ask for help but I know I would be jeopardizing our future by not allowing her space. 

I'm alone right now and I'm trying the coping tactics that I learned on the unit but I just can't get back to that feeling of having hope like I do recently did. I'm sorry if this post breaks any rules I just needed somewhere to write this all out.";LostInSpaghetti

A few years ago I met a guy online.. we talked for a month before we met, and when we met it was like I knew him forever and by the second day he wanted to make it official. 

We ended up getting a dog after being together for 6 months, and I ended up moving in with him. Things were so good and I was truly happy. I could see my self growing old with him. We ended up moving out of his apartment and got a place together 6 months after that. 

Things continue to be great and we ended up getting a second dog... then his father got sick, and then passed away. He didn’t seem super affect by it at first, but after a few months I started feeling like we were roommates more than a couple. 

I thought things would get better once he dealt with his father passing away, but one morning, completely out of the blue, he said he wanted to break up... 

I had a rough few months following.. I took both dogs because I didn’t want to lose them too. It’s a lot of work but definitely worth it. 

Right before we broke up, I got laid off from work and found a new, more stressful job, at an emergency animal hospital.  The stress of the break up, almost made me quit the job because I felt like I couldn’t handle it. 

Eventually things got better at work, I started feeling happy again.. and decided I really liked the job. I became great friends with the people I work with and all together felt like things in general were improving. 

Almost a year later, I met someone at work, we started hanging out and becoming good friends. We started going out and I felt happy again. But as soon as I started becoming really happy, I kept finding reasons why it wouldn’t work out.. why I shouldn’t be with him, until it got to the point where I didn’t want to be with him. 

I thought perhaps I just wasn’t ready, I decided to take care of my self and learn to be happy alone. And I was. I became happy and content on my own. I didn’t have any interest in being with someone, I had my dogs and that’s all I needed..

But, after some time being alone and being content with life, I ended up meeting someone. We hit it off right away, I felt super happy when I was with him or talking to him.. and started feeling more positive about the possibility of me being happy and things working out.. but again, as soon as I started to feel happy, I start telling myself reasons why it won’t work out and why I won’t be happy... 

I don’t know where this is coming from, or what I would have to do to overcome this.. but I just want to be able to find someone and not try to sabotage it as soon as things get good. This can’t be normal.";noxpatronum

Disclosure: the post is a bit edgy and has talk of ending life so please do not read further if you know that might upset you.

My wife’s uncle who she’s loved dearly since she was a child was fine until 6 months ago when he retired and it led to an immediate decline happened in his mental state. He went from being a social butterfly to confining himself in a room and then for the last 3 months he’d even stopped talking. His family (wife and two  hikers) did a lot to help him and even took him to another city to see a specialist.  He was staying with his son and his wife this morning when he jumped off the balcony of their apartment and ended his life. We are all extremely distraught but my wife is especially very upset. I’m not sure where to turn for help as my wife also suffers from occasional bouts of depression and although she’s promised me never to do any thing drastic I’d like to support her through this. She will see her therapist the week after next. Are there any resources that we can utilise in the mean time that can help her cope with this loss?

I went to see my psychiatrist yesterday, and she gave me the ok to seek funding (through disability's PASS program) for education and startup costs to start my own life coaching business!!



As a matter of fact, she said ""I don't know anyone else that's more qualified for this."" 😮



This means she thinks I'm healthy enough to train, get my certification, start my business, and make enough to get off of disability!! I'm so happy right now! I have my reservations and fears, but I put a lot of stock in how she sees me. 😊



*To give you perspective*, I remember 5 or 6 years ago having a complete paranoid psychotic break (mixed bipolar episode I think) when I lost touch with reality, heard loads of voices calling my name, thought people were out to get me... and all I could do is rock myself and cry in a dark room. 



And now I'm here!!! I'm so happy! 



I wanted to share this because I know some of you are really going through it right now. And I just want to let you know that it CAN get better. How? Because even if what your brain is doing may not get better, YOU can get better. You can seek help. You can get medication (if you wish). You can learn self-care and coping mechanisms.

505;Disconnected from everyone including myself;2;bi1kip;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi1kip/disconnected_from_everyone_including_myself/;0;2019-04-27 14:44:48;"I've been experiencing really strong feelings of derealization/depersonalization along with my depression.

Everything might as well be a lucid dream and I can never tell wether what happens actually happens. All of my memories seem fake and whenever I think of my name I get this weird sense that it belongs to someone else. My body operates without me participating while I'm watching from the inside of my head. 

To fight this feeling I tried to do weird and exciting things, because I thought doing something unusual should make a lasting impression on me. Plus I hoped it would help me trigger any kind of emotion other than numbness.

Some days ago for example I walked past a fence that was built to keep people from walking up to the highway bridge. I've contemplated climbing it before, but I was always too afraid. On this day though, it was torn down and I could just step over it. I walked across the bridge and back again, occasionally peeking down. Afterwards I expected to have a breakdown, realising what I'd just done. But the only thing that happened was my heartbeat slightly increased. So since that didn't do the trick, will I be looking for bigger risks to take?

It's like I want to light up a fire during constant rain.

I'm so sick of it. I started to isolate myself a lot, because I can't stand feeling disconnected when interacting with other people. Even my friends and family seem like strangers to me and that's why meeting them is often too frustrating. I crave affection and closeness so badly, unfortunately I'm unable to experience them. Sometimes all I want is a hug, but then if I get hugged it does nothing for me. Have I become completely cold and emotionless? That thought creeps me out so much.

I'll be starting therapy at a mental health facility soon. Everyday I anxiously wait for the call. It's been getting harder and harder to pass the time until then, so I took the opportunity for an emotional outlet by posting this.";SumoSeal

I have been known to 'self medicate' before with various illicit's so I'm handling it quite well but, I have been kind of stoned or tipsy all day and just kind of on edge in general. 

&#x200B;

I went into town with my girlfriend today to buy her a pair of jeans, we didn't succeed, I had no idea that woman's jeans shopping was so difficult, and I've been more of a space cadet than usual. I'm glad I had earphones or my girlfriend would have probably lost me from wandering off. I am usually in lala land but its been pretty intense today way more than normal. It is also the first day leaving the house for a few days, we are both battling moderate depression in general and I suggested it would be good to get out.

&#x200B;

I smoked weed normally but stopped around two weeks ago to give myself a break and to hopefully get the Dr's to take me seriously for once. I don't drink, I started getting really nasty on alcohol so I stopped. I noticed earlier though that I started to get like I do when I've had a drink, saying things that I normally wouldn't when sober and getting a bit nasty. I'm normally quite on top of I say so not to offend people, when I drink and today it's like the 'BS' filter starts to fail in my head. This worries me as my girlfriend is struggling with her mental health too and continuing the way I am is going to have a detrimental effect on that just as we are starting the healing process for both of us.

&#x200B;

I guess I should probably let my Dr know but I wanted to check with people who actually have experience on the drug so that's why I am here. Is this normal to feel a bit stoned and tipsy when starting out? or should I stop and tell my Dr?";ghostaccount5762
508;Downgrading Careers, Feeling Stigmatized;2;bi1iiv;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi1iiv/downgrading_careers_feeling_stigmatized/;0;2019-04-27 14:39:29;"This is my first post here. I apologize for how long it is, but I feel the need to just write some shit out. 

I've been depressed for most of the last two decades of my life. I'm 32 years old. I have always been 'book smart': Graduated Summa Cum Laude with Honors from College. I can speak well and sound like I know things even when I have no fucking clue -- A sadly valuable skill in adult life. 

&#x200B;

As far as planning my future, or even setting goals though, i'm a complete mess. I've spent pretty much my entire existence in a holding pattern, clinging to daily routines for some semblance of meaning. Though I can stick to a budget, go to the gym four days a week, and make an effort to curb unhealthy habits, I have never been able to plan for or envision anything more than a few days in advance. I'm just sort of there. Getting out of a bed, occupying space for 12 hours, then back to bed. I've spent more than 30 years like this, and have little hope that things will ever be different. That's not what this is about though... 

&#x200B;

The last two years have resulted in a lot of change for me. Being single, alone, and miserable on my 30th birthday was no longer just vaguely sad in a familiar way, it was fucking terrifying -- The downward slope on the bell curve of my life was visible to me. How my remaining years would pass, more of the same, with my body aging and gradually failing, until my death. I had to try something, anything, to make my life 'better', even if the choices made it more difficult in other ways.

&#x200B;

So after 7 years in a solid Marketing job in a major city, the stress and my own issues got to be too much and I just quit. I have never quit a job in my life. Even though I was making decent money my personal life was a mess, I went through an awful breakup, was drinking too much, thinking daily about how I wanted to die, unable to focus on anything, wishing I were dead, not sleeping, sleeping too much, envisioning my own death, blah blah fucking blah. 

&#x200B;

For awhile I drifted before finding work in retail. Though I was now working hourly for a few dollars above minimum wage, I found that this new lifestyle was better for me mentally. I didn't take my work home with me. If I was forcing myself to work through a  particularly bad depressive episode, being forced to interact with the public -- Though torturous -- Led to me realizing a better degree of control over my symptoms than I realized I had. What's more, I found that the service industry was full of people like me, who suffered a lot of the same symptoms, and had the same fears and regrets about life. No one was in a position to judge anyone else.

&#x200B;

I moved to a smaller city, somewhere I felt I could breathe easier, while continuing with the current company: Stocking shelves, ringing people up, unloading deliveries, etc. Work other people might consider 'menial' I guess.

&#x200B;

I've been single and basically devoid of a love life for about 3 years now, and when I left my last job I lost most of the people I knew. So i'm alone here, trying to connect. 

&#x200B;

Now i'm finding that my job is even more of a stigma than my mental health. Take online dating for example. It used to be I could at least get my foot in the door (Never mind that I fucked it up immediately by being a Depressive), now people ghost on me when I tell them what I do, or if I try to connect to people in person they give me a condescending smile before changing the subject. Given my age I feel that I've got a big 'L' branded on my forehead. Most of the public seems to view anyone aged out of their 20's a failure if they do this for a living. Or that they must be somehow damaged. Never mind that I've always been good with money, have no debt, and am able to support myself on what I make fairly easily.

&#x200B;

Though at the end of the day I feel I made the right choice for me, it is difficult to walk around with your head held up when you feel that you're a failure in the eyes of others. I know money is not the path to happiness, but most of the people I know - mentally healthy and  not alike - have bought into this. They see me as having 'given up'. Has anyone made a similar life change and felt this way? How did you deal with it?

&#x200B;

Anyway, that's more than enough. Thanks for listening.";Gaijinginging
509;Make it stop;2;bi1hbm;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi1hbm/make_it_stop/;1;2019-04-27 14:36:21;"I have been more depressed than ever lately. When I was in sixth grade I started going to therapy, then psych wards, then I just gave up. I’m currently 16 and things are getting so much worse. I’ve always been the odd one out of my family no matter how much they used to try to make me fit in. They all go out and do their own things and I just sit in my room listening to my “disturbing emo shit”, or as I call it My Chemical Romance. I’m sick of all of them and I’m done trying to deal with them.
Recently I got my first job (manual labor in a plant nursery) and it had been making me sick. I would come home, throw up, shower and sleep. Then the next day I would go to school, work and repeat cycle. I got sick of it in a week. That’s not a way to live, so I quit. My parents are incredibly mad at me for that. 
I have had a very supportive boyfriend through all of this job stuff, and I know high school relationships are almost always a complete joke, but he was always sweet and comforting and made me feel special for the first time in years. I’m a very reserved person, and this would go into a very inappropriate rant if I went too far into this but no, I wasn’t about to have sex with him the first week we were dating. But after a few months he decided he would much prefer someone who just wanted sex, so he’s gone now too. Just like almost all of my friends, that was lovely but short lived. 
My friends never liked said boyfriend, and they all are having a great time playing the “I told you so” game. Meanwhile they are all inching as far away from me as they can get. If I talk to anyone, it’s usually people online.
I have things I would like to do, but for those things you need motivation. Like yes, I always liked art and was quite good at it at some point in my life, and I would love to write and draw comics or paint something cool for my schools art gallery, but it’s so much easier to just spend what little money I have on comics other people wrote and just look at the paintings that the kids who have much more talent than me have already painted. Yes, I used to play the flute and I was good at it, but that doesn’t exactly get me money, or a future. Yes, I watch a ton of YouTube and I would love to be like freaking Shane Dawson but no mom, he didn’t get there overnight, and I have nothing to offer the internet. He makes people laugh. I make people concerned. I’ve never been special, and trying to act like it has made me into a mess.

Original post:

I've tried many meds over the years and nothing seems to help long term. With the meds I feel blunted emotionally and am not in panic mode, but my anxiety seeps through mostly physically and my quality of life feels quite low. I'm lethargic, tired, can't focus well, my body aches at times, etc. I've tried supplements, exercise, dietary changes, therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractics, etc. I even did genetic testing to see which meds would work best for me.


My therapist brought up the other day that she knows a doctor not too far that does ketamine therapy... which I didn't even know was a thing. She said that another patient of hers does it and has had good results. I've read about it here and results are mixed. Apparently you trip a bit, which scares me...

I scored 90 which is quite low if I want to go to a top college. I always thought my IQ was low. I couldn't make decisions for myself, I over-think a lot, make same mistakes and have zero creativity. I can't apply what I learn is a classic sign of low IQ. People with high IQ can connect patterns and solve anything. What can low IQ do? 
I wanted to go to a top tier law school but I think I need to give up and kill myself. my family has lot of expectations from me. But, who will tell my stupid family that IQ matters a lot. Top lawyers have IQ of 140 plus. Even if I try to study for law entrance and put lots of hours, still I will fail anyway. So what's the point of working so damn hard when a guy with 130 IQ will crush you anyway? Why to even become a lawyer when a guy with 140 IQ in a courtroom will defeat you very easily? 
I guess I am doomed from start! There is no cure for low IQ. Only one solution is working at a factory or cleaning toilets. I won't like it. I guess suicide would be good solution since I don't need to live my life miserably. Low IQ is such a curse man. My IQ would have been tested at age 10 and I would have been decapitated in that past. My parents made me suffer. I deserve a painful death. My life is so painful man! I am soo stupid. I wish I was dead. I want to stab myself in my brain!
There is no alternative to low IQ. In academics you need high IQ same for business. You won't find any dumb person leading a company. So when people say IQ doesn't matter, wow wait! People who say IQ won't matter are people who have high IQs. It's easy for Einstein to say everybody is a genius! He just says it to empathize with normal people and get famous. 
I would have killed at birth. Machete to my face is the solution for me or jumping from a building. My life is fucked.
My law entrance is on June 1 and I quit studying. I will just wait till 1 June and after my exam I will kill myself. Anyways a high IQ guys will go to top law schools and low IQ will be just spectators. Whole life same shit happens. God is unfair. Genetics are unfair. Why do stupid people breed? Why?

I do my utmost to be supportive to them, to put alot of thought, advice and validation in what I‘m saying but the same doesn‘t come back. From no one.


And I couldn‘t tell her because I didn‘t want to potray my friends in a bad light and I also didn‘t want to look like someone who sees everything negatively.



My therapist often reminds me that depression is clouding and that my APD can change the things I view. I get that. 


But people are genuienly not really interested in me and they barerly write me anyway, only if they need to rant or someone to listen to. But when I‘m the one, I don‘t get treated like I treat them. 


The answers are short, they are not as involved anymore. And I couldn‘t tell that my therapist because I feel like she‘d say it‘s only my depression saying me so.


But it isn‘t, I swear to god it isn‘t.


I‘m crying, I feel lonely and misunderstood. Like no one cares about me or understands me.";ThrowMeAwayFFS30
524;... so what happened?;1;bi0yct;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi0yct/so_what_happened/;0;2019-04-27 13:45:19;"I don’t want to make this long so I’ll skip all my past depression issues and present only the most recent scenario.
Forgive my English.

My last year of highschool is coming to an end. Here in Italy public art schools ( high schools and then academies ) are shit. SHIT. Their teaching philosophy is that “everyone is good! :) ” So they don’t have to teach you a technique, or how to draw... what’s important is that you “find yourself”.
You’re basically free to do whatever the fuck you want. They won’t explain you anything.

As you can imagine, since I am someone who actually wants to improve and wants to do it fast, that isn’t a great scenario to find yourself in... especially since ( because of money ) you can’t go abroad.
BUT! ( and here is where shit goes down ) I thought I had found my saving grace! A beautiful art academy in Florence... private, ran by Americans ( Americans are very good painters I must say. ) and ALL about the technique.
My painting Maestro had told me to look into it ( he thought it would be a good fit for me ) and I did. I looked at the website so many times and for so long I knew it by heart.
5k a year for three years and I knew I’d get out of there a painting God.
Just what I wanted.
My parents, altho I knew it was asking much economically from them, agreed on sending my there.
Until my dad noticed that it wasn’t  5k a year. It was 5k every 3 months... so basically 15k a year.
As you can imagine I felt like a stupid piece of shit. The only thing that kinda makes me feel better is that my friends also said they thought they had read 5k so idk? AHAH

Anyways... my parents told me no. It was a very hard hit. I had been planning to go there for a whole year now. It wasn’t their fault I had misread... but it was their fault how they handled it.
They started saying a lot of stuff that didn’t make any sense.
-We don’t want you to go there because it’s too expensive.
and then
-You can go there after you’ve done a public academy where they give you a degree.

.... So can I go or not? What’s the real deal?

So I started to realize that the actual reason they didn’t want me to go there was that they valued me having a degree MORE than me being actually good to what I love.

They want me condemned to a life of mediocrity. And I know it’s out of love because with a degree I can teach in schools but.... why aim so low. I’m a good artist. I’m above the average for ppl my age and I worked HARD for it. I know I can do great things... I don’t want to sit on the bench...

It hurts my soul to know that in a few months I’ll be in some stupid ass public academy “finding myself” surrounded by people who don’t want to work hard to be number one. I want to be number one. And I know that I can do it solo. I’ve always grinded solo art wise... but I feel the bitter in the back of my mouth when I think of how good I could be if I had money to pay for some goooooood college. Having good teachers is foundamental. 

I see kids on Instagram who have less than half the dedication I have having their parents paying for these bomb ass colleges and I can’t help but being envious.

I have no excitement for the future.
My future won’t be what I wanted it to be.
I won’t be great.
I won’t be anything.
I’ll be another mediocre art teacher...

I wish I could blame someone...

My depression is deeply tied together with my love for drawing.
I want to be the best so that I’m never sad about my artistic results... now I don’t know anymore.

I wish I was rich. 

I don’t think my future is worth living. The biggest thing has been ruined... I don’t know. 
I hope you guys understand why I’m sad ... sorry";magnostagno

So I knew I was mad that I was losing. My bf made a comment that not much has changed in regards to me quickly getting frustrated if I’m not good at something and my brother added, “does that happen literally all the time then since you’re not good at anything?”

Everyone laughed but he was more serious than joking and it honestly felt like he punched me in the gut. I have the worst self esteem and think I’m useless but I occasionally try to list things to myself that I’m good at to make me feel better. It’s usually the same couple of things but it works sometimes. Enough so that I’ve actually started believing it.

536;Punch Depression, in the face!(Southampton Based);0;bi0lqz;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bi0lqz/punch_depression_in_the_facesouthampton_based/;0;2019-04-27 13:10:55;"So, if my title captured your eye, give me like five minutes of you time, stick with me here! :)   
\[PRE-WARING, this is a longer post than I initially thought it would be, but it's worth a read if you're lonely or struggling\]

Like so many, I have...no job, no friends, a big ass heap of depression and a shit load of social anxiety. Ta-da, I'm just another guy on the band wagon, mm-hmm. But stick with me, okay? haha

&#x200B;

After feeling sorry for myself and feeling as if I'm just one big fuck up in motion, I started googling to see if I could find any answers, turns out, I found HUNDREDS of people facing the same issues as me!? I moved out almost a month ago, from a little town, to Southampton. And apart from my partner, I literally have no friends here. I've tried to make friends, got many people added on facebook and a few numbers, only, I never saw them again. POOF. Gone. 

&#x200B;

THE POINT OF THIS POST!? I want to reach out to people. Society/people have NEVER BEFORE BEEN SO DIVIDED.

  
Southampton is a crowded place, people of all walks of life live here, making friends should be easy right? ...WRONG.  
For some reason, the human ability to communicate has been shrouded in fear of rejection, fear in general, and of course, social anxiety. Everyone is walking around terrified, and probably because of the way things are in this country too. 

BUT.

I want to invite people to reach out, I sure as hell need friends, genuine people, y'know? Remember when you could call/reach out to friends and they were people who didn't want anything from you, they were just your friend? And when people actually gave a shit if you were going through some low days/times? Even when things were going okay, you could still rely on them to make time for you.

Society has changed, and I for one, keep falling flat on my face, because I don't understand anyone's generation right now, I feel like an alien to people now days! 

We've all got our own stuff going on, but I'm sure it'd be easier with some genuine friends to have your back, am I right? 

I officially invite everyone who knows how ridiculous ""things"" have got, to reach out.  
And by things, I mean, making friends, job hunting, etc etc ... what a time to be alive! I mean, sheesh!

You can trust my word when I say I know how hard it can be to do something about the situation you're in. But gaining a new friend can be effortless when you're either both as hopeless as each other or you just stop pushing and start going with the flow. Plus, you've probably got more in common than you realize, you just gotta stop fighting things, and say ""Fuck it"".

P.S

You may even be able to relate to myself, I've been firing job applications left right and center, I had a job interview the other day, and despite my nerves? I nailed it. Still didn't get the job though. I'm on UC and just about paying my rent, let alone keeping myself alive but living with minimum makes you a grateful person, that's how I look at it anyway, Fuck it.  I have a Level 2 NVQ in Customer Service, and Level 3 Music Distinctions, (I'm a drummer). AND I STILL CAN'T GET A JOB. YEET. If given the opportunity, I'd work hard and live happy, but don't get me wrong, I think about killing myself at least 2-3 times a day? Who doesn't? it's 2019! THE PRESSURE TO SUCCEED IS KILLING ALL OF US. But hey, that's life now. I'm 22, been playing drums since I was 7, I enjoy photography, although I don't think I'm all that good wit a DSLR tbh, and when I can be fucked, I enjoy writing short novels. But...rarely. I mean, shit haha.   


Anyway, if you're struggling, reach out. 

  
I didn't want to make this post, and I've read it 13 times, now, just to make sure there's no errors, I was looking at other people who were posting similar posts, thinking to myself... how brave they are, and ""How do they have the balls to reach out like that"" but I then realized they probably just said.....Fuck it.   
Personally for me, life is RIDICULOUSLY random, for example, I was like ""Yeah, I could get a coffee, or kill myself, or just get drunk, or make a post on reddit"" ... I mean, we're all struggling, just, know ya not alone okay? ...the system has fucked us all up aha! :)

I'm a tattoo artist currently and I love that I'm able to do something I enjoy. But I still carry a social anxiety since i was young. Its hard for me to let go of it and just relax when I meet my client. I usually feel okay later on and more natural. Well I haven't tattooed in 3 months. Have been helping family and everytime I spend a period of time not working and alot of time alone I become very reclusive. .

The biggest problem is I'm faced with an extreme pain of being stagnant. But at the same time am overwhelmed with fear of every little detail of going back to work. I tell my self that I'm not in a healthy mind state to start working. I want to be happy and excited before starting. And this had become a catch22. 

I'm just so tired of carrying this anxiety. That serves no purpose.  My heart aches thinking about how to deal with it and being alone in my house becomes increasingly painful. 

I need to change my perspective in order to heal. I need to learn to think in a entirely new way. About people and life and my self. And I think meditation would help me there.

In the past, my therapy has focused on causes of depression and discussing those things/events, in addition to some coping mechanisms. Lotsa feelings talk.

My new therapist's office is all about coping mechanisms (specifically dialectical behavior therapy, if you're curious). I'm just getting into it with them - still kind of a new patient there - but I think I'm interested more in questions of root cause - coming to terms with how my depression first manifested itself and what was the original ""spark,"" so to speak. They're open to both - next session is going to be all about 2008, for instance. But I'm wondering about what to emphasize.

I'm curious about your thoughts on the two broad approaches -personal pros and cons, etc. Thanks!

I have taken mushrooms several times (and other plant medicines/drugs depending on how you see it) and I felt they were so helpful with depression and how I view myself. but then I took a really large dose by myself during the day time and it was awful. I just saw all of the horrible consumeristic behaviors, wasting resources, war, etc. also I felt this overwhelming insignificance, like we do not matter to the cosmos in any way. 

After that experience, then having my first child a year ago (haven’t tripped since obviously), I just see the world as a dark. The news makes me cry all the time, so I try to avoid it as much as possible for long periods.

I also found out three years ago that my father molested my half sister growing up (she’s much older than me, so this happened before I was born, our mom stayed with him and had more kids...wtf) I found this out within a couple weeks of my sister in law dying and I think it was just way too much. I had one hour of meltdown, and then just kinda stopped thinking about it until I got into a relationship a year later. Knowing this shattered how I view my family (and also put a lot of things into perspective...and confirmed some uneasy feelings I had about my father). Unfortunately this also shattered my worldview. I just don’t feel like anyone can be trusted, and that everyone is capable of evil.


My sister kinda fucked me by telling me this because she doesn’t want me to talk to anyone in the family, or want our parents to know I know. She says it’s her trauma and she is healed now because of all the inner work and counseling she did in college (20 years ago). She doesn’t want our brothers to know either, and is basically protecting my dads reputation. She even still think of him as her dad even though he isn’t her bio father. I don’t want to talk to my mom as often because she essentially covered the whole thing up and stayed with him after he abused her child. I see her totally differently.  My sister even told me she didn’t want me talking to a therapist about it because she fears mandatory reporting. 

I want to feel like the world is not an awful place again. And I want any advice anyone has about dealing with family secrets or abuse.";onbluemtn

My girlfriend of a long time broke up with me 8 months back. It was a very shocking and out of the blue moment for me because I always thought we would go the distance. 

After breaking up we talked about it and she told me she has nothing personal against me and the reason behind breaking up is simple, it wasn't working for her. 

After giving it a lot of thought I realised that she has a point and it's in our mutual best interest to stay as friends and let this go. 

But it isn't easy is it? To just let things go and wake up everyday as if nothing happened? I got emotional and tried everything I could to get her back, but it was of no use. 

Finally I gave up, and realised that no matter how I try to change myself for better it won't go back to the way it was. 

Thankfully she was still interested in being friends with me and it looked like the natural way to go. We had our own doubts and reservations but ultimately figured it's worth the effort. 

Now the thing about breakup is that just because two people broke up that doesn't means that care or feelings just goes right out of the window. At times I was blamed for doing a bit ""too much"" for her for a friend, showing an extra concern. 

This mess of constant doubt and fights and giving in to our emotions continued for around next 6-7 months and then again just like out of nowhere it ended. 

We aren't on talking terms right now and I feel like we've broken up again. The same sulking feeling is getting into me. I don't feel like doing anything, just can't wait for days to change so that it looks like I'm moving somewhere in my life. 

Right now I'm doing everything I can to distract myself. Be it suddenly showing interest in MCU or giving too much of a fuck for some sitcom. 

I'm just tired of everything. Even though this is a very common issue to face, I feel I'm not strong enough to get better of this situation.

Like I said above, I have suffered from anxiety and depression for many years. I have always managed to cope with it using medications (sertraline, duloxetine). The drugs never solved my issues but they kept me from having depressive episodes

At the end of 2017, I decided that I would like to try to get by without ADs as the side effects were shitty and I didn’t believe that they were helping me anymore. Big mistake! After months of trying to fight depression on my own, I eventually snapped and had a complete nervous breakdown. For the past year, I have been in a state of utter despair. No amount of any drug could drag me out of the hole I had found myself in. 

Yesterday, my psychiatrist (the one that I have always had and is apparently the best one available) informed me that I was definitely bipolar. This came as a shock as I have never been manic, although I did experience some side effects on the duloxetine which were similar to that of mania (lack of empathy/emotion, agitation, anxiety). I’ve always been pretty depressed, but stable for the most part.
 
I don’t know what to make of this diagnosis. I’ve doubted her before, which resulted in me stopping ADs, and I deeply regret that. In desperation, I have no put my complete faith in her but I am still skeptical as I do not believe that I am bipolar.

Is the diagnosis possible without experiencing mania/manic episodes? Should I trust her opinion unconditionally as she is the expert and has known me since I was a kid?
Has anyone been successfully diagnosed as bipolar after a long period of believing they were suffering from depression instead?

Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. Thanks.";Annonomon

I keep flipping between fantasizing about suicide and *knowing* I can't do it because of how much it'll hurt my family.  And it hurts so fucking much, to *know* that I *could* die and end this pointless, painful existence, but I can't.  But I want to so much and I know one day I won't be able to fight anymore.  I just don't know when that is.

And I know it might be temporary.  But what's the point when it always, always comes back?  And what's the point when even the good times are just bearable?  I'm paralyzed.  I almost want to go to the hospital, but there's no point.  I can't miss work and I already know my family is burdened enough with knowing how I am and worrying about me.  It's pointless.

I'm about to referee a game of football and I honestly don't know if I'll be able to manage it physically, or how I'm going to hold up psychologically. I want to quit everything I'm doing and just retreat back to my bed all the time.

And I have never really talked about it with anyone. I mean, not really. Dropping hints, yeah, I did that. But whenever the opportunity arose to talk to someone it was so incredibly fucking hard, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. However, I have recently started a group-therapy with 7 other amazing people who are all struggling with depression as well. But it is coming to an end now, and I feel like, for all the good the therapy did, I’m in an even worse spot then before. And I don’t know how to continue anymore. So, in the vague hope that someone can help me with my problems, I’m going to try describing them, and maybe you guys have some answers for me.

Fuck, I’m not even sure where to start…

I’m currently a student, yet I don’t think I’ve visited a single lecture, because I couldn’t motivate myself to leave the house, to deal with the people, to deal with not understanding, with not being understood. Maybe I did visit some, I don’t remember, the last few years are kinda foggy. I kept telling myself that I should go, but the hateful little voice in the back of my head kept telling me, that it’s pointless and that I’d fuck it up anyway. And the pathetic little voice kept telling me “well, you could go tomorrow, and spent 6 hours doing absolutely fuck-all at your computer today.” An I did it, always, every day. I know now that university really isn’t something, I am ever going to be good at, because the only person who can hold myself responsible for anything is me, and I don’t care, and deep down I don’t believe I am worth the hassle.

Every single point of failure in my life keeps getting broadcasted in my head again and again, and the successes fade away into the mist or turn to ash in light of new failures. Every single mistake I did in class, every botched social interaction, every time I let someone down because I couldn’t even motivate myself to get out of bed, let alone do what I promised. And every Failure adds to the misery, making it even harder to o anything. At this point the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I am afraid of what a failure might bring with it. Yet at the back of my head there is another little voice, telling me that things could be better, that I am special, that I can change the world. AND THAT LITTLE VOICE IS A FUCKING BASTARD.

Because it is entitled. It thinks that it deserves to have these opportunities handed to it, that It deserves to have a key to being a hero dropped into it’s lab. And so, it keeps telling me that the mundane is poison, that the normal is just trying to get me down and accept that I’ll never be anything special, that I shouldn’t bother with regular things like studying, or a job, and instead drags me into these crazy scenarios inside my own head, where I am a hero, but it’s not me, it’s just a facsimile of what I think I should be. And so, I spend my time dreaming away my future and possibilities, a prisoner in my own mind.

And these little voices, they’re all me. And I think to myself that all I need to do is not listen anymore. But they’re insidious, I AM insidious. And the hateful voice keeps telling me about it, putting me down, telling me what a waste of potential and skin I am. And it’s me, and the existence of the voices makes me hate myself just as much as the voices themselves.

And my behaviour doesn’t get better, no matter what I try, I relapse. I spend all night up, escaping via books, or games, or movies, because at night nobody harasses me to do something with my life, to get myself a future that I don’t think I deserve, because I can’t stand the idea of having to stand the next day. And even when I can convince myself to go to bed early, I’m just lying there, with my mind going around in the self-hatred-carousel. 

I keep sabotaging my own feeble strands of happiness, not even actively, they just always crumble to dust, because of my action, or inaction, and I am sick and tired of it, but I don’t even know where to start changing.

I spend the majority of my life on autopilot, because I can’t concentrate on anything anymore, and half my time is spend in these little escapist dreams, and the other half is spend in existential dread, contemplating the futility of It all, struggling to find the point where we went so wrong, that all we do is only geared towards competitiveness and making more money. And we are killing ourselves, killing the animals, killing the planet. And I think to myself: “you’re a part of this. You are to blame for this as much as anyone else. And you should go out there and make a difference!” But I can’t, I am to afraid, and lazy, and pitiful to go out there and start making a difference.

And through all of this, I AM AFRAID OF LOSING THE DEPRESSION! Because it is all that I know. I don’t know who I would be without it, it has been with me forever after all. I don’t know if I even have a personality behind the mantle of depression and anxiety anymore, or if I ever had one. 

And I am searching for a place to get myself an apprenticeship, but who would want someone like me, who has dropped out of two different university courses and basically radiates depression and self-hatred. And even if I did find one, I’d probably just fuck it up again. 

Even now I see these mad ramblings I put down and think to myself: “who could ever have positive words for this mess of self-pity, self-hatred and failure. What a loser. You should just delete all of this.”

I suffered with addiction for the last 15 years and finally got my shit together 19 months ago. I was addicted to heroin, benzos, alcohol and cocaine. I was able to stop everything but heroin on my own and I went on methadone maintenance. The first two months of being off drugs I felt unstoppable and like a new man. After that all my anxiety, depression and pain came crashing back down on me hard

Before drugs I loved fishing, hiking, hunting, working on cars, working, and being alive. 
Now I'm just empty inside. Im diagnosed with major depressive disorder, agoraphobia and I have chronic pain from herniated discs and sciatica. I've had one back surgery and it didn't help the pain. I'm only 36 I have a great wife, and two beautiful little daughters. I want to not be afraid to go to work and live life but I'm trapped in my own mind.

I'm really good at hiding my sadness but not my pain. I'm often grumpy and angry and I feel really bad for this. I'm trying to get disability to help with bills and stuff but it's a long process and I feel worthless because I can't work. I take care of the girls while my wife works and they both love me to death and sometimes I feel like that should be enough to make me happy but it doesn't. 

I got hooked on drugs to begin with because it helped me with anxiety and depression. I felt like an unstoppable machine at work. I was an auto mechanic and when I was high I was a beast at my job. That's how I hurt my back I pushed my body way to hard and lifted and worked beyond my limits. But once I got hurt and couldn't work I lost control. I just want to be who I was before. I want to actually feel something inside. I want to feel alive again. I did start a slow taper off methadone and hope that once I'm off I might feel something again.";Shaundogg83

I was a very positive person. I didn’t believe depression could be so strong. When someone depressed asked me “how are you always positive? and can you help me become positive?” I never know how to respond because I was just positive because I never had any negativity to begin with. I always thought that when I get depressed I could just shake it off.

I thought I wouldn’t get depressed to the point I’m hurt, I thought this for a while until this one girl entered my life. When I’m around her everything is amazing, we would just have a great time laughing at others and at each other. With her I’m back to my positive self but without her I’m pushing everyone away. It’s weird how I could be complete before I even knew of this girl’s existence and now that I know this girl and gotten close with her without her I feel empty. 
I’m always the first to text, I just don’t feel that she has the same energy as me which is strange considering the how we have the greatest times of our lives in person just from talking, so I felt like I was bothering her so I left her alone. I finally built up my courage to ask her if she would like to go to the movies and she ignored the text until I asked a second time and she just replied “ my mother said no” I had to accept that because again I don’t want to bother her. I’m thinking on the bright side she would’ve went to the movies with me but her mother said no. But I couldn’t help but to think she just said that to be nice and she doesn’t want to go to the movies well atleast not with me. Now that I think of it the times we talked in person I was probably the only one having the greatest time.

People knew me as the guy with positive energy you want around but recently I became distant with people and friends. I always had the persona of a big tough nice guy so people never bullied me but instead it was just easy to make friends. Now I’m just getting sick of that persona because no one is concerned about me. My friend would just tease me about my weight and that is where I got most of my anxiety from. Not even my closest friends ask me if I’m alright . My parents do ask me if I’m alright but they are having problems of their own so I just say yes I’m ok. I changed my background of my phone and my profile picture to something cute in hopes of my crush ( the one girl that entered my life) seeing my as the sensitive guy i am. I would be in the middle of playing games with my friends and I would just get off and listen to music in bed while thinking of the mundane things I want to do with my crush. 

I feel immune to physical pain, the negative thoughts in my head would hurt though. I looked up the effects of being in love and having a high tolerance to pain but I didn’t feel like that was the reason. Why do I have a high tolerance to physical pain but get so hurt by my own thoughts?

I just feel empty. I just hate my life. Sometimes I wish I never met this girl and other times I’m thankful I did. I don’t know who to go to now and I don’t know who to talk to when I’m down. Should i just tell her how I feel?  No, I should wait until I lose the fat, she probably doesn’t like me anyways.

I feel like I go through a constant cycle on telling myself “I need to get help” but never ever falling through. 

I have 15+ tabs open on my laptop of therapists, 80% of which don’t even accept insurance, and for those who do, I (for some reason) mentally find an excuse/block that they are not “good enough” for my needs. 

Also.. why do I always make it difficult for me to just pick a therapist?? I have unrealistic(?) expeditions that I think I psychologically make as a way to avoid getting help. I don’t go to therapy because I tell myself: I think this specific therapist can handle my issues based on their description, or because I want someone who is a PhD psychologist and not a social worker (does it make a difference?), and I want someone who does CBT and MBT, but I also want someone who does EMDR (but that’s rare to find), and I am not sure how I feel having a male therapist (I’m a woman) so my options are even limited, and I am scared of picking the wrong therapist and don’t want to deal with “shopping around” and having to retell my story to multiple people and reliving all of it over and over again without making any progress. I’m worried that even though I cry at night every day now, when I go to the therapist office I won’t know how to begin and it’ll be a day where my mood is “ok” and I’m not having an episode.

Also, my options are limited because most psychologist/therapist don’t accept insurance (why????) and I can’t afford paying for it.

I need help and a professional to talk to, but I’m in a constant cycle of “no one takes insurances” and “the ones who do, I don’t like them and don’t think they can help me (???)” and “no no.. I’m fine..” or “wow I really am motivated to call any psychologist right now and take that first step at making an appointment.. **to bad it’s midnight on a Saturday** .. **cries all weekend waiting for Monday to come** .. **monday comes and all of the sudden I’m OK and doesn’t call** cycle repeat.";tthrowawayfuckmylife

Since 2014 I’ve felt like I’ve been put on this earth to deal with emotionless thoughts, anger issues, depression, and helplessness.

In my junior/senior year of HS I was doing the most to be this guy who was always happy, living good, smoking fat doinks, and all kinds of hoodlum shit. I guess I was trying to keep face because I didn’t want anyone knowing that i was going through some suicidal moments in those years. My former Ex-girlfriend and I had this weird relationship during junior year but in senior it matured a bit. We had sometime time apart and when we got back together I was noticing that she was somebody different too. Yeah Our high school selves weren’t even prepared for what life had in store. Well.. We broke up and I thought I was good. I stated making a better effort at making me happy, I got this new job and I started working! Life was cool at the time. Not thinking about the stuff that’s been happened at home..that’s for another time.

Fast forward a bit. 
2. 2014/15
I met this new girl while working at this one job. And if you’ve ever listened to “Tyler the creator - November”. Well there’s a little thing where you can hear 

“My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up and told me life would be different”

Cuts deep. What’s your November y’all?

I was graduating late, in the summer. What a drag.

Yeah. Right now at this very moment I wish I could’ve been taken back to that time. I’d go back in time and I’d tell myself not to get stuck and comfortable with another girl. Back then I was jus a sucker for pretty eyes and a fat ass. 

We trust the devils thats we do know vs the devils that we don’t .

This one event in my life made a huge shift in my life. My next 2.5 years had forever changed when decided to get myself into a relationship when i knew it was way too early. I hammered the nails to my coffin when I chose to be with someone who had these bigger goals in life and such great standards... it was hard bringing her around when you’re with the girl who was definitely out of my league.. my story with her is a long one and again. For another day. 

Fast forwarding again. Time passed by and our relationship started to fall apart. Because of me. Current me looking back at it: my biggest issue was communicating, respecting her, and well a ton.. I was so stupid back then. I mean shit I’m still so stupid right now. But it’s interesting to think about how different things would’ve been if I actually gave her the chance that she deserved.

I lost her to stupid mistake of my own. Something that haunts me all the time and it just makes me feel like an idiot because.... I can’t say a lot. She deserved more..
another
We broke up and she was already with someone else, slapping him all up on her social media. 

What do I do? I told this girl I loved her, and we started dating. But the past will always come back to haunt me in one way or another.

My ex came back to me stirring up this mess the two and BOOF I’m back with my ex.

THIS WAS HARD. Going in to her room. A different ass room. Where I knew her and some other guy fucked in the bed we picked out.. time flew by in this empty relationship where I was suicidal and she was openly still talking to that guy. 

The vicious cycle ends with me getting rid of her and I started to regress to what I knew was best for me. Getting fucked up, smoking, drinking, back shit. Fuck I’d honestly be locked up or dead  haha.. that’s thanks to my currents girlfriend. 

3. 2016
One night during my depressive rage. I found myself at friends house whom was a mutual annnd there she sits ... on the leather clutch her hair tied up, Jersey still smelled like work and this huge smile that made me feel fine after such a long time. We’ve been together ever since.

In the past 5-6 years my relationships. I think it has taken a deep stab into who I am and it affects who I am and what the fuck I’m supposed to do.

Right now. Things are always on edge. Seems like I’m always in the pot because I’m the one who’s always fucking up. I get really angry with myself and I just straight wailing into my self hoping that someone will hear me in the other room and stop me from making these bruised gashes bigger but one comes in, and I’m not beat and bloody. Friday night and I’m crying looking for something right in my life to happen.

As of right now. I love my girlfriend. And I hate that I love her so much. It kills me that no matter what the hopelessness, the anger, the suicidal thoughts, the loss of joy in life, purpose and all the other important shit..

Thanks for getting this far and feeling a part of me. On a last note for anyone IF there’s an anyone like me out there.. please don’t lose your sense of humor. I think it’s the only think that helps me get by sometimes.";EveryoneIsScrewed

Now I break my silence.;2;bhxphv;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhxphv/i_chose_to_stay_silent_about_my_middle_school/;0;2019-04-27 07:15:21;"Let me start blunt: I’m a 13 y/o male. And for a long time now, I’ve been miserable.

It starts in middle school. I believe it was in November when it first started.
I wasn’t motivated to do much. I didn’t believe in myself to do work. All I cared about was playing games to clear my head, get things off my mind. Before that, I was mostly happy. I was just like a regular 12 y/o that was going to middle school. I had instagram, first ever social app I used to communicate with friends. I was grateful.

But that’s where the problem begins.

I start feeling terrible; less confident, crying, can’t focus, can’t communicate well. I feel like something’s holding me back.
Let me state on record that during this time, I already had a diagnosis years ago for symptoms of autism (It’s more like I’m “on the autism spectrum”). This wasn’t too much of a big deal, I usually got mood swings sometimes.
But.. I chose to take my major stress to instagram one night. Wrong choice.
The next day, I was called down to my office to see a counselor. Somebody had reported my post to them, that I stated I wanted to kill myself. 
Yes, I was feeling that way, I felt like it was one of the only ways to get away. When asked if I had a plan, I said, “I’d probably just slit my throat like you see in some games.”

A notice of suicidal ideation was issued to me and my mother. I wasn’t permitted to be on grounds until I saw a psychiatrist.

So, I started seeing a psychiatrist bi-weekly. Like that helped.. I still was feeling miserable. I stopped trying with homework, often turning it in not done, or not doing it at all.
If I wasn’t “special ed”, I would’ve failed. Would’ve had to 6th grade over. But, this is Michigan, and I’m “special ed”, so they passed me anyway.

7th grade was probably the peek of my breakdown.
That year, was the peek of my fear. My nightmares.

I remember it all so well... it was February.. on the bus. Had a substitute bus driver. I sat down in the far back, next to the emergency door. Next to my problem... a 7th grade black guy named Kennedy.

I thought this guy was in 8th grade.. he looked like a high school football player. Someone you don’t want to mess with.

I didn’t want problems. I just wanted to get home. I don’t talk to him, until the problem begins.
He starts picking on me for my acne, how “stupid I sound”, even going as far as saying my name is like the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto IV.
I had enough. I wanted to move, I wanted this guy to feel responsible. I didn’t want to feel like a pushover, a weak person.

I get up from my seat to go to the front. We were at a stop. And that’s when it happened.

He grabbed my coat from the back, and starting tugging me toward him, while simultaneously trying to bribe me with cash in exchange for not reporting him. It was like a tug-o’-war game, except it was me versus him, and we were tugging my coat.
He eventually let’s go when the bus driver intervenes. Well, more like telling him to let go from the loudspeaker. I moved seats after that, not without him trying to ask if “we’re good”. This animal just assaulted me, and now he thinks it’s a joke? That hurt me more.

I’ve been through so much pain. I got assessed for suicidal ideation two times that year. My mother even wanted to go as far as take me out and homeschool me.


My point is, nobody should have to go through this kind of torture. I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. 
Now even though I’m homeschooled today, I still can’t forget my horrid years, and all the bad memories. And if I had to go back to that school?

I've been turning down trips because the bus is expensive, the food is expensive, the cover charge is expensive...

Im a person of point and meaning, but i have lost all of it now, i dont see reason to go on at all, i feel like i wanna kill myself but i dont want to hurt my family/friends, and i know that would hurt them a lot, but at the same time.. i feel torn apart inside, i feel like i just wanna end it once and for all.  
For the people who would suggest going for professional help etc, i have done it - i used to visit a therapist, and i had a therapy for almost an year, and i had huge progress, i achieved many things and i kept developing, but i just dont feel like i belong at all, i see no purpose at all and no matter what i do, i wont be happy.  
One last add up that i had was my girlfriend breaking up with me (week ago) and that totally devastated me, i feel like i really have no point anymore, because the things with her... it was what i needed to keep fighting and struggling and have a point and purpose (i know, a person should do the stuff for himself/herself, but still.. im a bit broken i guess, and i really feel lost and dead right now).  
I wont go into details for what happened, but let's say its my fault too (no cheating or something, just my own problems with myself), i feel like i wanna do a suicide but im scared of what's that gonna do to my family especially, i know that time heals but still i know how much they love me and im gonna leave a black spot in their lives for ever.  
As im writing this i'll be heading off to a workout, something which.. helps me .. to some point, even though shortly after i just really have this deep feeling of disappearing from this world, i just want to put an end to it.   
I dont want pity nor people calling me/saying how i shouldnt be emo or something, i aint but this is something in my life that have been around for so long that i no longer have strength to fight with.

How dare I?

The future terrifies me, I see no path where things get better, and i feel totally correct in my assumptions: I am a strange creature--legions different than the humans i find myself regularly surrounded by. Its so frustrating and lonely here in this massive crowd. Pop, on goes the mask so I can talk to people, a human-shaped mantle that I drape over myself to interact without making people uncomfortable with my oozing misery. I am incredibly lucky to have my one good friend who accepts me even though I am ""complicated"", But the thought of not having any other friends, or romantic interests makes me feel starved. I admit i love attention, a little too much, but i feel soooo guilty asking for it, to the point where i don't really know how anymore. I mean babies cry, but i just hide when i do that so no one knows I'm upset.

She was also mentally abusive. She would call me bad names and tell me not to hangout with girls. This actually explains why I’m very awkward around girls.

My close friends asked me if it was scary to hear, but I was like not really. I've been living with it since I was ten, it's not like knowing it has a name is going to make it worse. In fact it's a comfort to know that it's not just a personality flaw. 

For a long time I thought being depressed was just a part of my personality. I thought growing up, you just stop caring about everything you ever loved. 

And I thought the manic highs and lows were character flaws, like I need to sleep more, why can't I sleep, or I'm sleeping too much, I'm a lazy shit. 

So knowing what I know now, I wish I had sought help sooner. 

I won't say I'm feeling better in general, I still regularly wish I were dead or just not here, but it's almost like hope's knocking out there somewhere. Like I'm not quite as alone as I used to feel, other people have this, it has a name. 

And I know now that that is not who I am, or who I'm supposed to be, and it does indeed feel like an actual illness and not just something that's my fault.";arsenicmouth

When it all hit me, bitch, it hit me hard and I don’t think I left the bathroom floor for a good hour. I just sat there, crying and crying and replaying everything that happened until I got too cold and had to go back to my room. 

Im not going to repeat what exactly happened here out of fear of being judged and rejected even more than I already feel that I am. However, rejection is one of the ugliest things that I’ve ever felt in my short seventeen years of life. 

I know you’re probably like “oh you’ll find love somewhere in the future” or “you’re still young, don’t give up” and shit but damn I really loved this guy and I still do and I honestly don’t know what to do with my life, now that I know he will never feel the same way. 

It was all a mess, our conversation and I basically spilled everything out about how I feel and he just looked so disgusted and angry and I don’t know.  I hate seeing his face now because all I remember is him cringing when I said that I liked him. 

God I hate this so much. My mind is getting so dark and I hate that I’m letting myself fall so deep into this because I know what it’s going to lead me to and fuck it was hard getting out of it all the first time but I’m hurting so fucking much right now and I don’t know how to deal with it. I just want it all to end, all of it. 

I wish I could go back and take everything back and never say or think or even feel the way I did and still do. I hate that I can’t control my feelings and shit. That fucking makes me so mad and sad and overwhelmed. 

Why can’t I just stop loving him when he clearly doesn’t love me? Why is everything that makes me feel good so bad?

I used to find comfort in being by myself because I trusted me and I liked the way that I thought about things. But now I hate the way that I think and it genuinely scares me when I’m alone with my thoughts now because I don’t want to fucking die but at the same time my mind is telling me that I do. 

Really don’t know how long I can deal with this shit because it’s literally only been like one day and I’m already on the fucking edge. I’ve stupidly unscrewed the blades out of a pencil sharpener that I owned even though I fucking promised myself never to go back to that fucking shit. 

Why the fuck am I always doing the fucking worst shit to myself? I don’t even fucking hate myself but I fucking do at the same fucking time. I’m so sorry. Ugh.";lucas-ov

Recently I have been dealing with a bunch of very strong mood swings, and not sure how to process them. It seems that I could be in the best mood, then one thing is said or done that just turns everything around. Sometimes the mood goes away,  but most of the time it feels like I'm stuck on that negative thought. Once I'm stuck, it takes forever plus a ton of effort to shake the moods. I start to overthink every little about the current situation that is upsetting me which eventually causes me to feel very low about myself. I start off mad or annoyed, and end up extremely sad to the point of crying. My body turns numb, hollow, and I begin to feel like an inconvenient idiot who ""started drama"" with my random mood swings. All of my life I have had heavy anxiety, but lately it seems to be a force much stronger then my body can fight. I have also been considering finding a therapist or some form of counseling   but naturally I am very anxious into taking that leap. How do you know you have depression or how do you know it's another issue? I don't feel sad or unhappy most of the time. And when I do it's very sudden, out of character, and extremely heavy over something that may be meaningless.

He has a tremendous amount of negative feelings about himself, where’s he’s going in life, his job, him not being the kind of dad he wants, not knowing his father, not being close to his family and then us splitting up. 

He called my sister about a month ago and it was a night we got into a fight. He had  a gun in his hand and didn’t know what to do. I’m so very fortunate that he contacted someone whom happened to be my sister and she answered because who knows what could have happened if not. I really want to be there for him in any sort of way I can but I don’t know what I can do and what would actually help vs what would annoy him or make him feel worse. 

I certainly don’t want to push him away or make him have anymore depressing thoughts. He’s not one to ask for help or even communicate how he’s feeling at all. He will hide every bit of it for as long as possible and jokes about killing himself and not having a dad on a regular basis. It was a long process for him to even get into therapy. My sister suggested he also see a psychiatrist which I agree may be helpful. 

He has had suicidal thoughts off and on but I truly don’t know how close he’s come to attempting anything besides a month ago. I am extremely concerned no matter how serious the issue but I don’t know where to begin. If anything happened to him I don’t know what I’d do...I too also feel like I have a slight depression but I can usually snap myself out of it so maybe I don’t. I don’t know. 

His therapist now said he showed 11/15 signs of depression and she wants him to get on antidepressants and he is 50/50 about it. He doesn’t want to take them but he doesn’t want to be depressed either. He knows if he takes them and then stops, it’ll make those thoughts worse and I really don’t want that. Some insight or experiences with anything similar would be greatly appreciated!❤️

As a primary context, yes a lot of my damage stems from my family and a lack of validation. All of my problems are small, everyone else’s is big and I should just shut the fuck up.

I tried killing myself in December 22, 2013. Dad belittled me after the last time, I stole his gun, walked to my car and tried to shoot myself. The magazine fell because I was a dumbass. Too scared to try again, I called my brother. Made things worse. “Don’t kill yourself” but “your problem is just your perspective in life”, “I have 3 mouths to feed and I think of killing myself too lol, just hang in there” and everything else to try and belittle my problems. Went home to dad, berated me more. “You tried killing yourself because I said your only value is that you’re good at video games”. Yeah, on top of every belittling things I’ve had to deal with in life. Just gotta keep it in.

Fast forward 6 years. After being a manager at a collapsing company for 4 years, I left. I learned “self actualization” where you don’t really need external validation anymore. I lied to myself after living years with low confidence. I lied to everyone, believing that “fake it til you make it”. I did gain confidence. I was good at my job and was only 1 of 4 employees after a big cutback (the company was dying and the owner was faking “everything was going to be ok”). I was a lowly draftsman and eventually worked my way to being the de-facto VP. If I left, everything would turn to shit, and when I did leave, it did (my friend kept me updated). Needless to say, I was on top of the world.

Right. That was just a lie.

Left, got a job in 2 weeks even though that was literally my first job in 4 years. Aced my first interview. Got a new job doing exactly what I’ve been doing for a lot of money in a big company. My confidence is at peak.

Until I started. Getting put down for “me being new, you don’t know how things work” while at the same time “you have experience right? You need to be on top of everything”. In my old job, my word was almost law because in a shit situation my old company was, mistakes were fatal. And the only mistakes I made were trivial because any big mistakes means the death of the company. Now, I make mistakes everyday.

It’s not even the berating that got me into this. It’s myself. I lost that confidence I gained. Everything I told myself was a lie. I was never good. I am in a job I don’t really deserve to be in. I have no friends because I refuse to put myself in a position of vulnerability, after being taken advantage of in the past continuously. I can’t get internal validation, and I have no desire for external validation.

Fast forward to 1 hour ago. Brother wanted to watch Endgame with me. I went. Right away, he wanted to talk about my job (my family always only wants to talk about my job). It’s shit. I opened up a little, was getting cut off before I can finish a thought because “I’m just trying to give you advice and perspective”. Yeah, shit hat I’ve thought of everyday, and nothing helps. I got frustrated and just unconsciously was yelling my thoughts out loud. I guess it’s because no one listened. He yelled back at me, saying “I think of killing myself every day to but I have 3 kids” all that shit I know already. Basically, I just have to internalize everything because “you have no mouths to feed” and someone, somewhere always had it worse than you.

“You need help”, sure I do. I am asking for your help and you shut me off, pretending that you know exactly what I’m going through because you’ve had something similar. Basically, the same damn thing that happened 6 years ago. Back the. I was in tears and crying.

I got kicked out of the car and drove home just now. The most surprising thing is: I still feel nothing. I drove normally and I don’t really have that “empty” feeling you have when you’re depressed. I’m actually really proud that I felt nothing. Probably because I stood up for my thoughts against my family, for once.


I’ve had depression all my life. I’ve never really changed. My thoughts were always like this since, but I protected my family from it by acting emotionless all the time. The one time o tried opening up, I got attacked. The last thing I said was “none of you support me. Every single problem I had, you invalidate because life is shit. Well, life is shit and I know, it’s why you’re seeing my like this for the first time because I kept it all in. I know that no one really cares about anyone’s problems, like you literally said just now. And the only place I can open up and be myself, after fighting the world and holding it in for the day, you antagonize me. This is the first time you’re seeing the real me and you hate me for it.”

I used to always say that I’ve not killed myself yet because that microscopic chance of survival turns me into a coward. Now, not so sure. Coltina-45 years old is looking pretty attractive right now and I might hit her up.";Tancossin4212

Never had a super long-lasting friendship, so I always fear people dropping me out of no where**

I grew up in a pretty standard setting. I had two loving parents, a wonderful twin sister, two uplifting dogs whom I'd definitely call my two bestest friends. I also had my interests that, on paper, are absolutely normal. 

I LOVED Star Wars growing up. Neither my family nor I know how my love even started. Neither of my parents nor grandparents were Star Wars fans and my sister wasn't disinterested, but she grew up interested in typical girl things for the time. But I just remember watching Return of the Jedi and loving the Ewoks and cheering as Darth Vader returned to the Light Side and throwing the Emperor off a bridge into the Death Star reactor. I remember collecting Legos and action figures, playing video games, and dressing up as characters for Halloween. 

I also grew up loving music. Ironically, I don't play any instruments, but I definitely plan on learning one once I'm through with medical school. I grew up to old-time R&B and soul my parents played and classic rock that my Dad would play when he'd drive me around. I initially listened to just the music my parents played, but my tastes eventually broadened and matured to pretty much any genre now. I currently listen to albums of any kind as a hobby and collect vinyl records.

Due to current affairs going on in my life, I've just been reflecting on my past. That may sound like something bad is going on currently, but truthfully there isn't anything bad that's been making me feel down lately. I can't even pinpoint the exact reason, but something is compelling me to get this off my chest after a short conversation in a group chat I was in. I think bullying from my past plagues my present.

Going back to my childhood, my family has been wonderful growing up. But that doesn't mean my classmates or other kids were. I remember going through early elementary school as a complete loner. I remember trying to make friends in pre-school, kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4rd, and even some of 5th grade where I just couldn't make friends. I remember a lot of it had to deal with having different interests that my classmates. Its elementary school, kids aren't going to judge by character or what not. If you don't like things that other kids like, or the norms, then you're weird. That being said, I remember just getting straight bullied for liking Star Wars as a kid. I remember getting laughed at and being called a nerd for wearing a Darth Vader shirt. I remember at recess where I would talk to kids I would associate with, not necessarily my friends because I never went over their houses or anything, and kids would rip the Star Wars hat/beanie off my head and throw it to the ground and stomp on it.
This was also the time bling-era rap was popular and other pop tunes that, at the time, I had no interest in because I liked the music my parents played. I remember kids making fun of me for liking Guns 'n' Roses instead of the new Lil Wayne or Kanye West song. I remember getting my iPod taken by bigger kids on the bus and laughing at the Bee Gees music that was playing. 

I just remember going home, running to my room to cry or this spare room in my house where I had my GameCube to play by myself. I remember overhearing my parents talk about me because teachers would tell them about my lonerisms during parent-teacher conferences and just feeling like an all-around loser. 

I was a pretty big kid growing up, so my father had me play tackle football at 5th grade to try to toughen up. It kinda worked. I wasn't bad at it and I played it in high school, which gave me (I'll use the word again) acquaintances to associate with at lunch. High school also sucked for me for practically the same reasons, but not one really ""bullied me"" because I had some size from playing football. I just never got invited to parties and what not. 

Eventually I got a job as a lifeguard at a local waterpark and made my first set of true friends. The friendships were probably forged due to crappy work conditions and shitty managers, but man they got me through the last half of high school.

Undergrad was also a time where I made some friends. It is where I joined my school's rowing team and finally met some kids that had similar interests. But the bullying and lonerisms from my past led to some soured relationships in college because I had this constant paranoia of losing these friends out of randomness. Even to this day, I have constant paranoia that people will just drop me because I like different things or if I accidentally annoy them once or twice. Right now, I'm in medical school and I keep to myself for the most part. Thank God people are adults now and either think my Star Wars and music interests are cool or they simply respect it and mind their own business. 

But again, the paranoia of randomly losing friends haunts me. I saw help last November because one of my friends from lifeguarding that attends the university my medical school was in has roommates that assaulted my sister and one of my friends from undergrad. I was depressed and mad as hell about the whole situation. I was also home sick and stressed from starting medical school. I got put on an SSRI and participated in cognitive behavioral therapy, which got me over that really low slump and made me functional, but I'm still so paranoid. I'm sitting in bed right now having some serious reflection time and had this revelation I had to share somewhere.

Sorry if this read felt disjointed. I'm just really sad right now because of my paranoia and somehow my mind wandered into my loneristic past.";CLE_VIII

So I'm preparing for what is called one of the toughest exams in the world. It needs reading several books for objective, subjective, and interview exams. 

I,a few months back was a complete mess, with alcoholism and addiction to marijuana. Also a girl whom I really liked, dumped me in the worst way possible. Thanks to God, I got my job transferred to my hometown, and now I'm with my parents (they don't know about my addictions), so that's been really helpful in tackling and subsiding the addictions.

So I met this psychiatrist, who told me that I small percentage of every type of mental illness, and even I think I do ;-p

So I'm under the following dosage: I've been using these for few months- and results have been really good- except for the lethargy

Divalproex - valproic acid - 250 mg every night

Piracetam-800mg,vinpocetine-5mg, Gingko biloba -60mg - every afternoon for memory

Fluoxetine: 20 mg morning - few days back the doc told me to increase it to 40mg

As I told, except for some lethargy and time management issues, the medicines are working for me, since I am able to concentrate on my studies better than before. 

The thing I'm really doubtful about is my doc increased the dose of Fluoxetine from what I read what was normal adult dosage. Please comment about it.

Thanks for being kind and reading.";rahulonehart

I have no space of my own or time to myself and I think that’s only making everything worse. I picked up a second job waitressing to try and make some more money because my husband complains that we don’t have enough and I can’t keep myself from making it my fault. Well tonight a newer waitress literally made $100 more than me and for the life of me I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Why can’t I be a good enough waitress? I also feel like they were cheating me out of tables but I can’t really prove it. On top of this I have obligations from my other job. And I feel like a burden to everyone because I share a car with my husband and that leads to me always having to have someone drive me everywhere because I don’t have a car of my own so I can’t do anything myself.

I'm not aware of how much I can perform in any entrance exam, although many people have called me a smart person or something but I don't know where I stand in this world of students aspiring to join a very good university like me. I didn't study in a reputed school or in a GCSE or some school like that. Well, I don't even know if I'm underestimating or overestimating myself. I don't even know if I'm gonna make it. All i wanted in my life is CS and nothing else. Nothing. No awesome food, clothes, or anything else. I don't even ask for things lol.

But one thing's for sure. Either I study CS or I die trying. In 2 years, I'll have nowhere to go to. No one to call mom and dad. Or am I just spoiled? Honestly, I don't have a clue. Am I gonna die?

Edit: I think as long as I have at least an ounce of strength in my body, I will fight. I think I can still do something about this with the little money left. I will not die without trying, but I have no idea where to start from. I've searched the internet for a bunch of info, but I think I need some guidance on this.

I haven't made any friends in the past 5 months I've been here. I can't find a job. I have no excuse for not excelling in school right now but my grades are suffering. I have no energy, or just any motivation to get out of bed, go to class, do homework. Panic attacks happen at the most inconvenient moments.

Countryside, farms and hills in every direction but due to its location between two large towns that have been established for centuries and were quite big players during the industrial revolution, making the village I live in a crossroads between the two aswell as neighbouring villages and local farmers. Due to this the village became a place for the workers to stop after work or on travels, long story short, we jump to 1998 when i was born and the village has 2 stereotypically British pubs, 2 cocktail bars and a night club. Jump again to 2019 and now its 6 stereotyically british pubs, 3 cocktail bars, 2 wine shops and 2 night clubs. Bare in mind all of these are in the same approximately 250 meters squared. The amount of booze and drugs that are consumed per week, on average and accounting for population, in this village is higher than anywhere in Britain. We have a higher case of mental illness than anywhere else in Britain. We have one of the highest drug and alcohol related deaths in Britain. 

I am the youngest of 5 in my family. So theres (gonna use random names just to be safe):
Jacob - 33 
Jenny - 30
Jonathan - 28
James - 27
Junior (Me) - 21
My family was living in this village before I was born so I've lived here my entire life. Due to us living in a village, every family knew each other and thrpugh the years before i was born and while i was young, my siblings had made a name for themselves. We were the ones who were known for being straight to the point, forward and would never beat around the bush or hide what we felt. We were known for holding house parties that were regarded the best by far and became almost a village tradition to be at our Christmas and new years party (I know it sounds so vain and stuck up but I don't think the parties being great has anything to do with us, the house is just built in a way that makes it perfect for parties). So I grew up watching my siblings, one by one, go through the house parties and drugs and girls (sisters a lesbian), I grew up with those family friends that are basically part of the family, the ones your siblings went to school with and you can't imagine them ever not being at least regarded as a close acquaintance, but in this village that meant they were getting pissed up in fields at 14, smoking weed and fags at 16 and taking coke and pills by 17. At one point, there would be like 8/9 people in that main friend group that would come round for pre drinks at like 5pm, maybe 3/4 times a week, get pissed for cheap at home then just go out and drink stupid amounts, smoke some spliffs, sniff a load of coke and take a couple pills. I watched this happen to all 4 of them and even from a young age, I was aware that there were drugs involved. I knew about drugs and I knew enough of the most basic stuff (they're addictive, people are weird on them, they can cost a lot, a lot of the time they're used when in groups etc.). Living in a village, entertainment was limited so people watching and eavesdropping were my main way to stop myself feeling bored, from this I learnt all about my families use of drugs, their secrets, what they were planning and so on. So I formed an opinion of drugs like cocaine and weed at a young age; ""Some are very bad and are never to be touched, some can be fun but can't be used to much, some can be used as medicine and for fun when not abused"" 
I smoked my first cigarette at primary school in year 6, I was 11 (I think). I had my first joint when I was 13 at a house party a friend had thrown for his birthday (just to point out how bad this village is, he was turning 14 and his mum and dad let him throw a 50+ person house party, with booze, for his 13/14 year old friends). I had my first line of cocaine at 14 from one of those family friends I mentioned. I had my first ecstacy pill at 15 on my high school leavers party night. Since then I've tried shrooms, LSD, Acid, Ket, Speed and MD. I have never, for as long as I can remember, cared for anyone around me. I see use and potential use in people and that's all. I will and have fucked over, stolen from, got into physical fights with, back stabbed, abandoned and emotionally abused family, friends and strangers. It's not that I'm selfish, to be selfish I'd have to care about myself but I just don't have any feelings for anything. Family, friends, myself,  life...any genre, topic, subject or hobby... I have no drive for anything at all and even before the drugs I felt this way. In all social groups I'm connected too, I just play a fake me that was made specifically for that group. I play a character of me every single day in front of every single person, switching the mask each time I am in proximity to a person from a different group. It's not as easy as just taking off the mask and just being me... I am far from sane and the things that I'd say without my own filter would 100% leave me without a job, a family, any friends and genuinely I believe that I would be put in an asylum. While that makes it seem like I care about people or my own life/well being, the only reason i dont want that to happen is because these people all have uses and things to exploit to be able to just get fucked up and forget everything. Literally everything I want in life is to just get fucked up till I die... everything else is pointless. Every single day I something that makes me think just how stupid people are, how just eratic and illogical everyone is. Yet for some reason we just sit here and pretend as if everything is fine while the fucking morons and dipshits of the world somehow get ridiculous amounts of power and control everything.

Tonight my parents sent me to the store to pick up some items. It’s night (which is the time I prefer to shop anyway, less people = less anxiety) and I’m in the back of the store, pushing my cart along. Having that normal unique vibe that only a grocery store at night can have.

But I’m at the back, looking at the godforsaken hotdogs of all things, and this sudden wave of depression just... engulfed me. 

I legitimately felt like curling up on top of the hotdogs and sobbing for no good reason. I was having a pretty okay day before! (I mean I know food is expensive but that’s no reason to want to sob, jfc /s)

I mean, sure I’ve been a bit stressed lately. One of my cats got hurt, and my nephews 2nd birthday is tomorrow but, I’m doing pretty alright.

The last 15, have been absolutely soul-destroying.  This last year, just put me over the edge.  My birthday is coming up in a few weeks, and this time last year, some really bad shit happened in the lead up to it, that on my birthday night, I ended up with my head in a leather belt, zip-tied, and a handful of sleeping tablets.  

The last year, as a result of shit from last year, has been too much, and the 12 months just flew.  Don't think I can do another 12 months.  So I've decided that it's time to take 15mg of Nembutal and some Motilium, and take a peaceful sleep on September 17th.

Not really looking for advice.  It's not depression any more, just pure defeat.  I've accepted it.  Spent from May 22nd last year, up until February taking Sertraline 200mg, and it was of zero help.  Taking tablets doesn't fix the world I live in.  After the last 15 years, it's just pure and utter defeat.

Now I'm just wasting away, barely eating, spending all my time either playing videogames or listening to depressing music.

She calls my parents and my dad comes off work to take me home, he is just silent the whole ride, then when we get home he gets offended and mad cause he feels like he didn’t raise me right, and my mother joins him. I was saddened by that fact. They took away all my electronics, but I managed to steal my phone.

My mother soon realized that wasn’t the way to go, punishing your kid for suicidal thoughts doesn’t help.

A little back story to start. Names changed. About a year ago March 2018 me and my boyfriend moved in with his brother(Dylan) and his brothers boyfriend(James) into a two bedroom apartment in downtown Portland. They had just moved to Oregon from another state and me and my boyfriend had been living in Oregon for 2 years. My depression was really manageable during those two years.

I had just graduated cosmetology school and got a job as a receptionist at a hair salon and was supposed to become an apprentice soon there after. Long story short, I had to quit after 3 months because my anxiety had gotten so bad from the terrible work environment. 

For the next year I had no job and was being supported by my father financially. The anxiety only got worse because of James. He was a seriously toxic person and was emotionally abusive. He would yell all the time and it was just a really bad environment. 

I got diagnosed with severe panic disorder, agoraphobia(fear of leaving the house) and monophonia(fear of being alone). I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 (currently 23) but it wasn’t affecting me much because my anxiety was so bad. I couldn’t drive anymore because I felt like I was going to pass out every time I tried, I had to go to the hospital multiple times because of panic attacks, I couldn’t be alone in the apartment basically ever but never wanted to leave.

I just want to say my boyfriend was so fucking supportive during this time. He really is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and was really understanding. 

In November Dylan and James broke up, and James moved back to his home town. Things definitely got better but my anxiety was still really bad. Me and my boyfriend decided after our lease was up in March we would move back to my home state. It’s a lot cheaper here and we wanted to save money for a project we want to do. I also thought being closer to my mom and dad and old friends would help me. 

Fast forward to about January and my boyfriend was second guessing our move back. I still wanted to move back because I wanted to be close to my family and I had already told everyone we’d be moving back in March and didn’t want to let them down(I realize now this was a mistake) 

So now we’re back in my home state, my anxiety has gotten a lot better, i’m not afraid to be alone anymore and it’s just better. But, it seems like my friends have sort of moved on, my mom doesn’t accept me being apart of the lgbtq community so that’s really hard and my dad is on hard drugs i’m pretty sure. It’s really hot here in the summer, it’s already in the high 90s and i’m miserable. I miss Oregon so bad. Me, my boyfriend and Dylan got along so so well and I miss him so much. He’s like a brother to me as well. I have no energy to find a job or even leave my apartment. I’m so fucking depressed. I cry everyday because I think I’ve made a terrible decision. We don’t have the money to move back to Portland and neither one of us even have jobs yet. My boyfriend is trying really hard and I can barely even look at them. 

The cherry on top is that I had an amazing therapist in Oregon. She was like a mother to me and I miss her so much. I don’t even want to try and find a new therapist because I know they won’t be her. 

I’m sorry this is so long. I just don’t know what to do. I’m not suicidal, but we haven’t even been here a full month and I hate everything about being here. I’m so pissed at myself for not listening to my boyfriend about staying in Oregon because I didn’t want to disappoint a bunch of people who don’t even seem to care really.";idkwvr-
685;financial fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering;2;bhvnpp;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvnpp/financial_fear_leads_to_anger_anger_leads_to_hate/;3;2019-04-27 01:46:05;"Hello 

I don't really know where to start.

I'm currently 'faking it until I make it' at my job, handling very very large transactions and waiting to be paid once something closes - I just don't know when that will be. 

We're close, the company is in good standing, the workplace is fun, legal is just taking forever with the contracts.

I've basically used up all my reserves while my baby daughter was on her way. She arrived and we've been living off crumbs. 

I couldn't even pay my wife's phone bill 2 weeks ago so she's completely blocked to the outside world unless she's on WiFi at home. 

She tells me she feels I locked her up in a cage on purpose.

After getting off meetings with people showing me accounts with $10.000.000+ ready to buy what I'm selling (if things are lined up correctly) I walked out of the office, looked around if anyone sees me and took a bus home because I can't afford to fix my car.

Then I had to decide whether I want to buy toilet paper or half a dinner for my family. I went for dinner.

Haven't paid rent in months. Gladly the landlord is a friend of mine who has been very patient with me for over 5 months but his patience is wearing out.

I asked my millionaire dad for money; he sent me a few hundred € but that barely covers anything - I'm grateful for that. Haven't asked for anything since I turned 19 and received a large chunk of money which is partly tied up in Real Estate and/or in businesses that won't return anything in the foreseeable future.

Sometimes I can afford everything, and then - because I overspent while overconfident, my finances turned on me. 

I've changed that behavior after cutting it close twice and have been very frugal but I haven't had a large enough payday to get out of these mini debts and have enough to live comfortably until the next money comes through.

Anyway, that's the financial aspect of things.

So I met who I think is the love of my life about 2 years ago.

I broke off a 3-year open relationship (open meaning I always communicated very clearly that I'm seeing other women next to her) and decided to be with my wife exclusively.

After a few very intense months we decided to live a life together, move in together and have a baby. The months leading up to the birth of our child were super exciting with what I think were normal ups and downs.

My resources were pretty much on reserve right before my daughter was born but we weren't worried. 

(Some Real Estate transactions were already signed and about to be paid; didn't happen - contract breach and purchase behind my back. 

I'm preparing to file a lawsuit that I'll win but that'll take months, I'll also probably end up settling for less than 10% of the full amount owed simply because there's always the option of bankruptcy and that would leave it at 0.)

Every dad probably says this but my daughter is the most beautiful baby I've ever seen.

Her smile makes me smile, her cry makes me sad. 

**I want to spend whatever time I can with my family but my financial situation makes me feel like a failure and running off to work is basically my cocaine.**

We live in a pretty nice place in Vienna, nice rooftop apartment. I guess something you'd call a penthouse, not like New York Billionaire but nice.

The neighboring apartment is owned by my friend/landlord and our rooftops/balconies are connected.

Going outside to enjoy the summer hasn't really been an option because his wife rightfully gives me the 'where is my money' look.

The problem is that my wife is even more stressed by this than I am - which leads me back to her cage analogy.

I understand her frustration and I'm working on changing it. We will have money again. I don't know if this Tuesday or in many weeks - I think that uncertainty probably doesn't help either.

Okay, so I think that's a pretty detailed look into our financials and our living arrangements.

It's 6:00 am as I'm writing this, shades are down so it feels like 4:00 am. 

I left the bedroom about 30 minutes ago to apply for jobs, after promising my wife I would. 

Instead, I'm writing this.

I don't really want to apply for jobs, I've never worked for anyone - only ever with someone or for my own company - I don't think I have what it takes to work for someone, nor do I think I can find a job that pays enough for my underqualified ass.

We've been fighting a lot lately. I try to just swallow what she throws at me and see it as my fault because in the end it most probably is. I wouldn't say these fights are about money per se but about existential minimums.

Because of the way my tax structures are set up she hasn't received child benefits - those are weirdly tied to the child's fathers job. That would take a large portion of stress off her (€33/day/365 days) - I'm trying to get the papers done but it's taking longer than expected.

""Friday"" I promised her. That was yesterday. Papers aren't done yet. 

Helping with the baby is a whole other topic. 

I play with her for 10-20 minutes then she cries. So I give her back to her mom; and I know it's too much for her but I don't know what to do.

In the middle of the night my wife will wake me to burp the baby after feeding her, so I do that, sometimes reluctantly because we're both still half asleep. Sometimes I won't wake up because I sleep so deeply. Sometimes she'll let me sleep. Sometimes she'll wake me with a 'kick'.

We haven't had sex in a while. 

At first, I didn't want to because I was scared of hurting her. She thought I didn't find her attractive. 

Sure, her body changed, but she's still the most beautiful woman I've ever met and now she's pretty much back to her 24-year-old model shape with a few extra pounds. I would say she's a hottie.

Sometimes I'm tired. Sometimes she's tired. Sometimes we have sex and the baby wakes up. 

I write up the bad things she says to me in a notepad on my phone. 

Never read those things, don't even know why I do it.

I write up the good things too, sadly they're so few (I forget to write up a lot of them because I'm enjoying the moment while it lasts) Those I do read, they make me happy.

Hmm... I don't know if this is much less or much more than people usually write as a beginning.

Weird. I want to feel bad for myself and cry or something but that hasn't worked for years. I don't really feel much. for 

I just want to release the pressure somehow... 

Oh yeah, that reminds me.

I think of incredibly horrific things at times.

Things like punching someone in the face if they piss me off. Punching them until they're completely out. All teeth broken, hanging on to life by a thread, blood everywhere.

Not my wife or my kid or family and friends, random people. Why? It's so strange.

Is fear manifesting itself as anger toward society? 

I don't understand that rage. It comes for a second and goes again. Completely. Gone.

It's relatively new to me and it's fascinating in a way but mostly annoying. I just want to get on with my life and be happy with my wife and daughter.

Well, this writing exercise put some thoughts into perspective I just wish I could talk about what I really care about. The love of my life - my wife.

I just don't know where or how to start and how to fix it so she's happy again. It's killing me. Devouring me. How did I fuck up so hard in so little time?

How do I make her understand that she means everything to me? How do I show her that our daughter is my everything?

For the first time since moving into my dorm room four months ago, I cleaned my room. You wouldn’t believe how much trash there was. Takeaway boxes, empty drink cans, old documents. Five bags in total. I can’t believe how much trash I was sleepin in just because I never had the energy to clean.

It’s really helping with anxiety too. At first I heavily relied on lorazepam to feel “normal,” and now I don’t feel like I desperately need lorazepam anymore, despite having two months of its prescription left.

It’s crazy. My psychiatrist also said I was lucky because I found the compatible drug on first try.

I don’t feel that strong pain I felt for years when I look at the world, anymore. I take daily showers and brush my teeth now. Small tasks and setbacks don’t feel overwhelming. I don’t feel that strong obsession for people and that tunnelling loneliness anymore.

It’s great. It’s expensive but it works and I’m happy to pay for this instead of wasting money on things that only make me happy momentarily like a new shirt or feel-good meals. In fact, I’m losing weight naturally on Pristiq.

The first week was rough, I was sleeping all the time, I could not remember anything, could not even form new short term memories, could not orgasm, but now everything’s stabilising and I don’t feel like I’m on drugs. I just feel well.

Sure, there are bad days, but that’s normal. And I’m still halfway befoe the time Pristiq usually takes full swing so I feel optimistic.

The best part is, I don’t think of suicide daily anymore. That was tiring to do.";poor_icarus

Literally the only three people I can rely on and that I like talking to are my dad, my grandmother, and my grandfather.

I stopped seeing my psychologist about a month ago because she was extremely unhelpful and didn't seem to 'get' my situation at all (eg. she laughed off the fact I had started taking speed again, and didn't seem to understand the severity of my sleeping problems, where I have been only getting a few hours of sleep per night and have constant nightmares/hypnopompic hallucinations to which her helpful solution was to 'listen to chinese gongs before sleep'). Stupid me for seeing a cheapo psychologist who is subsidised by healthcare and thus free, I guess, but I could never afford to see one on my own income. I also stopped taking the medication I was on because I thought it might be causing my sleeping troubles, but all that's done is bring back my sex drive, appetite, social anxiety, and depression, so now I pretty much never leave the house.

Throughout all this, literally the only reason I get up in the morning is to listen to music, and read books about music. I sort of went off my music obsession over the past few years, but ever since these past few months it has resurfaced in a massive way.

at school, im seen as this introverted girl who get all A's in her classes. some find me weird because of my quietness, some find me weird because i wear band shirts and black jeans. sometimes, ill get picked on because of my acne. but, im used to that.

anyways, ive been crying for the past hour because i feel like such a useless, worthless, piece of garbage of a human being who only sleeps to find joy. when im awake, i feel pain. mentally. i sleep this pain off, usually all day. i have no reason to be this sad for no reason. i have wanted to self destruct and, give up a lot. but, i never have. honestly, i think i should be happy because i have a generally good life. i have a home. i have food on the table. and i have bed and clothes. i am very grateful for my mom and my step dad for providing our house. i live with two older brothers and one younger. that's fine. i also switch between houses once a weekend to go to my dads. i have internet friends i very much love. 

but. i feel like absolute shit. all the time. i don't know how to describe this pain other than being numb. i am very numb inside. i feel very little emotions that are not being slightly happy and sadness. these more negative emotions are extra extreme when i am about to get my period/ when i do have it. before when i was almost twelve, i had never felt this way before. & these negative emotions are even worse during the winter. sometimes my life feels like: sleep, eat, school. i don't study for tests and i get very small amounts of homework. yet school is just so hard for me now, because i am not motivated enough to get out of bed. to not do my work but, i have to.

other than my older sisters ( one in college, one in the air force ), are really stupid to me. my second youngest brother did ninth grade three times and dropped out. my oldest brother, dropped out and now smokes weed a bunch although, he has a job at walmart and i am very proud of him for this. respectively, my brothers, in the order i explained their situation in, are nineteen and almost twenty.
i do not want to end up like them, addicted to weed and drop out. i don't know what i would do to myself if i ever did.

im only barely thirteen, and i have contemplated commiting suicide. i feel like i have no reason to live, that there is no joy in my life to keep me going. but, i can not commit suicide, especially so young, because the thought of making my mom, dad, and step dad sad makes me even sadder than i already am. my name is hannah, im thirteen, from maryland and im here to ask you guys if you think i am depressed or just faking it or something. i don't know what to do with my self anymore. 

ALSO : i am too afraid to tell anyone in my life that i feel like this, especially my mom. i just love her so much and i would hate for her to know ive been feeling like this for a year or so.  a few people at school know i feel like this, but they usually just joke around about it. it makes me uncomfortable, but that is okay. i trust them, because they're my only friends at school.

EDIT: thank you for all the comments, they're all so amazing, helpful, and unique in their own ways. you guys have made me smile while reading all of them, it's helpful to know that there is a big community for me to talk to. i plan on trying to update you guys if i ever do anything major, or even minor, for my feelings. i appreciate all of you so very much. you all mean very much to me now. have a fantastic day or night, guys. sincerely, your bosslady, hannah; 13; from maryland.";weishenvlovr

And also how can you tell someone you’re not okay, i tried last night and didnt speak to anyone because all my close friends went road tripping for a music festival and i dont want to ruin their time, i still have friends here but none i want to burden with a whole lot of bullshit, and i cant tell my parents because their heart is in the right place but ill fucking throw myself into a wall than sit through that conversation.

697;What are the signs that you are actually present and experiencing your life?;0;bhvdyq;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhvdyq/what_are_the_signs_that_you_are_actually_present/;0;2019-04-27 01:09:48;"Right now we live a screens and boxes life.

You wake up in a big box that has a roof on it and the first thing you do is look at the screen on your phone. Then you get ready for work and drive in your box to your workplace box. You stare at a screen in your workplace box for 8 hours and during your break you stare at the screen on your phone, then you drive home in your box with wheels to then sit on a couch in your box at home and watch a screen until you are tired and fall asleep.

Box, screen, box, screen, box, screen, box, screen.

That is not living your life. That's 80 years of living in boxes staring at screens only to then be buried in a box.

Then we get sold this idea that our home box has to be big and fancy and you should work 30 years of your life to pay it off. Then the box you drive to work needs to be the fanciest shiny red sports box to impress others. The workplace box you go to has to be a really impressive and fulfilling work box so you go to university so you can end up working in the best box. Then the screens you stare at need to be the latest Samsung iPhone 5000. You have to fill your home box with heaps of stuff because stuff will make you happy.

Get the fanciest box. Fill it with stuff. Then find someone to live in your box with you so that you can stare at screens together.

This isn't living ""your"" life. This is living a life designed to control farm animals.

Problem is we spend so much time worrying that everything in our boxes is ""just right"" or as good as other people's boxes, that we ignore the fact that we are in friggen boxes!

So what do we need to start doing differently? What are the signs you are actually living life, because box, screen, box, screen isn't living life.

I've recently really found it to be true that the things that you own end up owning you. The more you have the more it dictates what you do and what you worry about. 

So I know I have to stop going after more stuff. 

I also need to find the opportunities to experience life. That requires putting down the screen and going outside the box. I did this today on my lunch break and went to the park. It was so nice outside. Especially when you pay attention to it and be mindful. I also deleted fortnite last night lol. Such a time drain, and I would rather spend that time with my baby boy. 

I'm interested to hear all of your ideas?

My innocence and youthful smiles have long since faded, and been replaced by a stream of tears and wearing a frown that has been on for the past 4 years.

Even when things seem like they are going well on the outside, I more often than not feel more alone and depressed than ever. 

The friends of yesterday have moved on and haven’t talked to me in years, leaving me alone with my own dark and depressed thoughts.

In school, I see people scattered around me appearing happy, chatting away with friends, making plans for next weekend, while I roam the halls in silence, secretly envying them, wishing I could have happiness and friends in my life too. 

People may think that someone like me, with supportive parents, a stable household, and receives a quality education at a catholic school could never be depressed, but that could be further from the truth. 

Sometimes when I am thinking, I catch a glimpse of an image where I have a loving wife and children, and a successful career, but deep down, I deem this to be fantasy, and tell myself that this will never happen for me. I tell myself that I am destined to end up a failure with no friends, family, or anything.

 I still get hurt by what others say or do, even tho I know it won't matter soon. Why should I get upset when people don't treat me righ? I don't deserve to be treated right. It's all illogical.

 I was in two near death accidents when I was just a child and even back then I wished to die.

I don't want anyone to know I did it on purpose either.

I am going to tell a bit of my life story, so, be warned. Think of this as a confession of my mistakes. 

I was born in Rio de Janeiro. Lost my father at 5, so was pretty much raised by my grandparents and my mother. I used to have such a good life from my country standards... Had good health, good friends, a bit socially awkward, but there was always people that I could count on. I still am one of the most intelligent people if you give a shit about IQ. Had money. My mother never had any debts, because she was really careful around money and she worked for the state, which pretty much guarantees that you have a good wage on most of the cases. 

Around my teen years, I developed the start of a depression, and probably my anxiety got worse. At one point, I pushed away all my friends and ditched school so I could be at home watching anime. I eventually got back to talking to them and finishing high school within a year.

After I started university, I dropped within 2 weeks, then I changed programmes, went to International Relations. Dropped after one semester, which was one of the worst decisions of my life, but I'm only starting. I also tried to open a business, but honestly, didn't put a lot of effort into it, so more money to the drain. I also tried to start podcasting for a while, but stopped because the editor was too expensive, another bad call from me.

Things started looking up when I started my new course in advertising. It was actually engaging to me, and although it wasn't a perfect fit, I would be able to do it properly. Then, on the same year (2016), my mother had a stroke after I left the house and almost died, if it wasn't for my grandfather's screams, I would never had come back to save her.

She ended up without any serious after effects from the stroke, which was great. And at the same year I lost one of my state pensions because I opened my business, even though they had no right to take it from me. Another story for another convo. I used to receive state pensions because my father worked for them. Two of them, one for each of my father's jobs. I should have received both until I got 24 yo. Then, started a long and tedious process of getting it restaured. The amount of money is 30k U$ dollars. Which would really help me put my life on the track.

Then, I start to have another terrible year. My anxiety got worse and I think I might have had a ""small"" case of PTSD because of the incident. I get really sick during my finals. Somehow, I pulled some great grades on the more theoretical subjects. Everything goes a bit messy, but I could still move on with my life. Until 2017.

That was a rough year, I had met a former girl that I really liked, and discovered that I still liked her. She liked me too this time, so I thought things were going to be different. She ends up breaking my heart. So I get in another depression. Without even realizing, at the end of the year, my mother has another stroke while she was sleeping.

My mother wasn't perfect, but she loved me and she did everything that she could for me even if it she wasn't smart enough. And I feel that I have failed her. I should have acted on it, after some episodes when she lost her memory from the last day and becomes really soft, I should have guessed that there was something really wrong with her brain. She broke 6 discs of her vertebrae while sleeping, even with osteoporosis, that doesn't happen. But now, the only thing I did was spending the night playing league of legends and finding her body on the morning.

After that, I started getting worse in college, my grandmother had died in 2012, so my grandfather went to live with my uncle. He is narcissistic and used to think that my mother was using my grandfather's money to herself. Which is none of his business, because he never once offered to take care of his father so my mother would have some time off.

Then I started living alone. A man-child spoiled by his mother and who never had to work one day of his life at 23 years. I still had my pension, but since I was so depressed, I spent it in shit to try to fill my belly. Then, I went back to gain weight. 20kg/45 lbs around the year. Did some things to try to cheer me up. Visited New Zealand.

Then, this year, at 24, I decided to leave Brazil. I didn't had a family, I wasn't standing the loneliness and knew that I couldn't survive forever without my pension. In Brazil, even if you work, you don't get enough money to survive. The monthly wage for a full-time job is 250U$. And you can get shot on your way to the job. Then, I get a working holiday visa. To the only country available. France. 3 months to learn lots of french, and I managed learn a lot, but I am still, 35% fluent in french. Which isn't a lot to understand conversations.

Then I go to France. I thought that I should have bought some time for me too look for a job by doing volunteering, so I opened an account on Worldpackers. My first experience was terrible. I got made to do something I was not fit to do and didn't even assigned for. The second one was great, bit tiring, but made me feel really happy about myself.

Now I want to find a paying job for the next months. In France, of course, but wouldn't mind to work in the UK or Ireland, since I can have a conversation. At least one thing I came to understand about myself is that I want to study tourism in Portugal. So now I have a goal. But still, I need to work at least 6 more months in order to make some money and survive. And don't know how.";gafanhotojudeu

I've either had to give up hobbies for work or I ended leaving them behind because they weren't productive enough or because I grew to feel nothing when doing them.

How do I break the cycle my friends. It's grown to the point where I think about offing myself nearly every day, I feel like I've wasted my entire adolescence for nothing and I either want to find a better way to finish it, or to find a way out.

I finally reached a point where I could no longer hide my true colors lately. 

I am feeling like shit to put it bluntly. 
My attitude is shit too. 
The good thing is that I finally understand why I am like still as a grown adult from time to time. 

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder last week. 

I was going to post this there, but I’m feeling more depressed about my actions more than anything. 

Up until a week ago, when I became absolutely heartbroken for the last time, I was pretty positive and had a great attitude. I was feeling lucky, getting things done and very optimistic. 

Now, I’m just fucking tired. One bad thing stirred up everything else and I’m loosing it and just not giving a fuck. 

I’m not jail prone or anything. Just Zero tolerance. 

Basically my family knows I’m not doing well. 

My mom called me yesterday and brought it up trying to help. 

I had a breakdown with her. 

It wasn’t fun but everything’s fine. 

Mom called my older sister and told her she needed to talk to me etc etc. Told her everything I said about her too. How I feel abandoned by her etc etc. 

It’s a long story.

So, older sister runs into me at the park today while I still try to maintain a happy healthy life for my son, and invites me to dinner. 

I leave the park and go to the grocery store with my 5 year old son. 

It’s busy as fuck. 

Nobody knows how to fucking walk or push a cart.

My son is asking for this and that!

This lady keeps riding my ass with her cart in every fucking isle I’ve seen her in. 

My child runs off while the store is busy and my anxiety is high, and that lady is on my ass again! 

I fucking stopped dead ass right in front of her and let my cart ride into the milk shelves. 

I zoom past her and yell for my child. 
Find him and come back, and pretty damn loudly but under my breath said to my son, 

‘You need to stop running off from me! And this bitch needs to get off my fucking ass!’

She heard me. 

She mean mugged me. 

I’m not going to lie. I don’t really care. I do, and don’t. It was just a bad day. That lady got too fucking close and needs to respect personal space.

I’m just sad I’ve reached this point. 

I want to feel happy again. 

I hate when I’m like this. 

I was chill and quiet at dinner. It was fine.

After secondary school, our family moved to a new city and I was separated from the friends I had from secondary school and they were the first friends I’d ever had. Before university, my parents constantly verbally abused me and broke me down because I had the audacity to go against their wishes and study a subject of my choice. I chose Mathematics. They wanted Medicine so they could parade round their doctor son. Because I did, they broke me down to what I became when I started university. Extremely awkward and socially anxious. Unable to talk to anyone. No confidence in myself. Their abuse made me attempt suicide twice while I was home alone and the rest of my family were in another part of the city. 

I tried counselling and it did not help one bit no matter how many counsellors I tried. I tried meds and the side effects made me feel even worse and want to do horrible stuff to myself. The only thing that actively helped was my ability to depend on friends I had made in secondary school but I didn’t get to see them often enough because we lived so far apart. 

At some point, I couldn’t take it anymore and left. I moved out closer to my university into some shithole room in a house share that was less than 6m squared for around £450 a month. The bed took up a third of the room and the wardrobe/chest of drawers took another third. I blocked my family everywhere but I started getting calls from unknown numbers and police visits to university. Two weeks into signing a contract for this place, I was told I had 30 days to move out as the house had been sold. This led to me moving into university halls accommodation.  I made another friend there. We were very close and would eat together daily but his visa ran out and he left after he graduated from his masters programme. 

That summer, I witnessed a murder. Two muggers murdered a man for his watch and I saw it outside my own window. I worked night shifts at a local store but I couldn’t anymore. Anytime I heard a moped, anxiety would hit 100. I testified in court and the murderer got put away but the whole experience definitely fucked me up more than I knew. 

Throughout all of this, there was a girl I was friends with. She was someone I was able to rely on for everything and was always there for me, as I was with her. We’d only met each other like 5 or 6 times because I was introduced to her as a friend of my closest friend. I had told him about problems I was having and he guided me to her, saying she’s had experience and could help. This guy is someone I see as an older brother and if he trusted her, I trusted her and I told her and that’s how our friendship formed. Around a few weeks after we moved out, she stopped talking to me completely. A few days later, she finally responded with a very simple “Hi, I don’t want to be friends anymore”. The next day she went on to explain that I was a burden on her and my negativity and problems bought her down too and she couldn’t have that. She was right. I didn’t see it at the time but I was bringing her down and I was a burden. We had a long-standing snapchat streak and we kept that going for a month, sending each other blank snaps each day, in case she changed our mind.  She did and we video-called that night. It was the only night I had smiled and felt kind of happy even though the video and audio quality was horrible. She ended that call with “we’re still not friends” and said bye and we hung up. The next day, she said maybe we should call more regularly so we did. Not like it was before but we talked every now and then. Sometimes, she would get really mad at me for no reason at all and then ghost until she pops back up and acts like nothing happened a few days later. Usually, I apologised and waited for her to feel better, messaging hoping for a response. The friendship ended the week after the murder because this happened and an argument started. I don’t know if it was the same on her part, but the friendship turned toxic and it wasn’t healthy for either of us. 

My university work was stressful and I was still getting blocked number phone calls almost daily hurling abuse whenever I made the mistake of answering them. However, despite my terrible social skills, I managed to build up a group of friends and was semi-happy.  One of the friends, I was especially close with. I fell for her and we eventually started dating (Over two years ago now, wow). She was amazing and one day very early into our relationship, she came over because I was ill. She came with my favourite Turkish food that I mentioned once in an off-hand conversation ages before and that was the day I was sure she was the one. I loved her than and I love her even more now. She was the one who pushed me towards trying to mend relations with my family and I was able to, slowly. We took it properly slowly but eventually I was able to visit my family for a night every week. 

At the end of the second year of university, I moved home for the summer. I regret it because it showed me how shit life was and that nothing had really changed. Everything that happened was for show. My mom argued with my sister daily (still does) and they threw insults and horrible words at each other. During these few months, I could only see my girlfriend for a day a week or two days maximum but even this was difficult with my weasel sister telling my parents about her after she snooped through my phone. This was because she was in trouble and had to throw me under the bus. It hurts because I’ve always lied for her to make sure my parents don’t hurt her like they did to me but the slightest bit of trouble and she’d throw me in too and get me into trouble in the hope that it would get them off my back.

 I moved back out as soon as I could, lying about university semester dates, and soon after, I was told by my friend from the time I was in halls that he had a storage unit with a few of his belongings that was gonna get emptied a week after and if I could hang on to them until he came back to the UK. I agreed but then found out a few things was enough boxes to take up a good chunk of my new room. Because they were there for the whole 4 months before he eventually came back to the UK. When he did, I offered to let him stay with me until he found a place. My culture means I have to be hospitable and I offered him the bed and I slept on the floor. I thought it would be ok because it’s just a week or two before he find somewhere. It was a month. A month of working and earning enough money for 1 person but paying for 2. I felt like he took advantage of the situation and had no urgency about finding himself a place. Eventually he did and I am glad because it meant I had my room back, now without boxes. 

As I am in my final year, I have to find a job. I’ve had over 150 applications, around half of which didn’t even bother replying. Out of the ones that did, I got 4 face to face interviews as part of last stage assessments. 2 said no for lack of experience, 1 didn’t respond and the last one was the one I was most confident in. There were 8 candidates at the centre and there were 7 jobs available. I felt like I did really well but I was told I didn’t make the cut. Asking for feedback, the manager said I performed extremely well in the group activity and the individual interview but the interviewer thought my skills are better applied to statistics. I applied for an accountancy role and I did not mention statistics anywhere in my degree. I was so angry at myself. The one time I was confident in my work, I was slapped down through, according to the hiring manager, no fault of my own. I’m still applying for jobs but can’t find any and it’s stressing me out even more. I have been neglecting university studies in the hunt for a job because if I don’t find one, I am scared the abuse will start again. 

I’m scared of the future. My girlfriend and I are both from different cultures that are very racist. My mom expects me to marry within my own race and, because she suspects I have this girlfriend, takes any chance to say horrible stuff about her race. Stuff I can’t bring myself to tell my girlfriend. I have to listen to it and hide it all in because I don’t want my mom’s ignorance to hurt her feelings. Her parents expect the same and aren’t accepting of interracial marriages. When it comes to it, there will be a lot of fighting and I’m scared but I put on a brave face because I know it’ll work and that it’ll be worth it. 

I’m not in a good place. 

All of this is killing me with stress. I often find myself wanting to die but being too scared to commit suicide. I don’t want the people I love to know about the stuff going on and the stuff weighing me down. I don’t want any of them to feel responsible for it in a way and I’m sure it will never happen because of that. But I can’t help wanting to die. Every time I read about a knife attack in London where someone got stabbed or about an accident, part of me can’t help but wish it was me. My problems would be over and the people I love won’t feel responsible or guilty or like they could’ve helped it. I haven’t slept properly in months and I hide it by saying I can handle it. I can’t though. I don’t know what to do and I know the thoughts I have are unhealthy but I can’t help it. I’m not strong enough to keep doing everything I’ve done so far. I just find myself wishing I was dead so I would be at peace with everything. I’ve hidden this from everyone and have an outwardly happy face and I know talking about it with any of them would hurt them. Since I lost one friendship I cared about through my constant problems and being a burden, I can’t bear to lose another. Nobody knows my Reddit account but I can’t risk it in case they do so this is where I decided I wanted to vent it out so at least I’m not the only person that knows. There might be someone somewhere in the world who’s read this and they know too. 

I know it’ll get better eventually but I don’t know if I can do it until then. I know I will never attempt suicide but I can’t help the thoughts of wanting to no longer be alive. I just want to be at peace.";LowEstimate9

One second I'm optimistic of the future, then it falls and I feel like I can't do anything. Or I get so excited about something coming up in my life, and then two seconds later I just want to curl up in a ball. Thinking I'm doing good in my life, and can see myself being happy, then I'm crying into my pillow a few moments later. I have dreams, and my hopes of achieving them seem within grasp, but those highs do not last long. I feel like I'm black inside. All of these colors are flowing through me all the time. Happy, sad, excited, anxious, hopeful, doubtful, passionate, unenthusiastic, etc. It gets to a point that a lot of time I just don't care, and not in a good way. A lot of people's mentality is just to say ""F*ck it."" But for me it's different. It's more of I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to care. But then sometimes I do. I'm just constantly flip flopping and what I can accomplish everyday depends on what colors decide they want to be apart of this disasterpiece. Thinking too much about the past and feeling too many emotions have got me wanting to just blow up sometimes. I just want to get into bed on a cold winters day. Snuggling with my pup as we go under all the blankets and listen to the rain as it crashes into the roof. Then I'll feel depressed because I wasted the day. My mind is so hard to please sometimes. Like when you really don't want to go to school and your mom let's you stay off, then the entire day you're just like.. Should have went to school. I am going to miss something important.

I think I could live a full life with those feelings if I also had highs to balance them out, but I can't remember really feeling happiness or contentment at all in my life, at least for more than a minute or two. Going to the gym, trying to date, working on personal projects, none of these things really bring me any kind of positive feeling, other than the intellectual concept that I'm taking up time improving myself which I like. But there's no endorphin feeling, no spike of joy. Sometimes I wonder if happiness is an actual emotion, or if it's more a general term for just not being upset.

The pain wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be and it actually felt kind of nice. It left a sort of stinging sensation. I then used a tissue to clean the blood and kept it there for a while. That was about an hour ago and the pain slowly died down and now I can only slightly feel it.

It made me realize, since about 12 years of age, I haven't really felt solid joy, only quick moments which speedily give way to the regular feeling of apathy or just....meh. 

I can't really remember the last time I felt happy to the core, it's only ever surface level. I've got diagnosed and treated ADHD which can cause anxiety/depression. But I'm wondering if the depression if that's what it is, can be treated also? 

Meditation and exercise are fine but they don't fix it. I'm just numb or irritated or low all the time and I can't remember the last I felt happy for more than ten minutes. It's there when I wake up and when it's time to sleep. Nothing is that appealing but I've lived this way for so long, it's hard to tell if perhaps I'm just a morose or overly realistic person.

(i browse this subreddit a lot). i'm also sorry if i use crappy grammar and/or spelling, i'm operating at half capacity right now and don't have the willpower to fix any mistakes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some quickish background: my mental state hasn't been the best as of late. I've been keeping a journal of my thoughts for the past 4 months now and when I read it back to myself I honestly feel sick to my stomach. When I read it I say to myself, ""this is a man who is not adequate for life as a human."" In other words, I am not worthy of being blessed with the gift of human life. I pretty much have the ability to pursue whatever I want but instead I'm apathetic all day and just mindlessly browse youtube, jerk off, binge watch, go on reddit, listen to music, or (insert unproductive activity here). I bought weights but I'm too lazy to use them. I bought a lot of books but I can't even bother to read them. I mooch for money off my parents because I'm incapable of getting a job myself. I can't even diet correctly because my body literally has no appetite. I've lost the sensation of hunger. The last time I remember being genuinely hungry was months ago.

&#x200B;

Skipping all the other juicy details, there are some points in my life where I wish to tell someone about my issues. I just want to let the water works flow and let them know why I don't respond to their texts or calls. Why I don't ask anyone to hang out with me. Why I don't call that cute girl. It's not because I hate or despise them, it's because I can't fathom putting in the mental energy in order to hang out with them. And even if I do get the energy to even consider hanging out, I'm pretty much going out of my mind the whole time. Overthinking nonsense and all of that. you guys know the drill, I'm sure.

&#x200B;

But as soon as I decide to tell someone I instantly freeze up and never do. There's a familiar thought loop that plays out in my head that I'll describe: 

&#x200B;

First, I think about how they won't take me seriously, won't give a single shit, and just think of it as a joke. A ""meme"" (I'm so sorry). Why do I think this? Because look at all of the people nowadays who literally say ""i have depression"" just because their favorite show on netflix was cancelled. Multiply that by a million and everyoen and their mother, on the internet anyways, is bascially saying they have depression, anxiety, or some other serious mental illness. Obviously I don't mean to downplay anyone's suffering, I know a majority of people, especially on this subreddit, genuinely suffer from the problems they describe. But it pisses me off everytime I see something like ""ohhh my friend didn't invite me to his circle jerk session oh woe is me  im gonna go kill myself"" Ok maybe not that exact scenario but you get my point. It makes actual sufferers of mental illness taken way less seriously by their peers.

  
Now if I manage to get past that I hit another roadblock. I think about how my problems would inconvience them and their little universe. Like, why should I listen to this kid's problems when there are a million other interesting, positive, non-depressed people out there who I can be friends with? Why should they have to listen to my bullshit and complaining when they probably have a bunch of other people who are actually fun to talk to. They would tell me to ""fuck off man, i don't even hang out with you, i don't even give a fuck about you, why the fuck are you comign to me with all of this bullshit? You're fucking disposable. I don't need you, I don't need these problems. You know there's therapy for these sorts of things right?"" etc. Sidenote: The idea of having to pay someone to listen to your problems because no one else will kind of sickens me. I don't dislike therapists or anything, they're amazing people who do god's work, but whenever I think about going to one I just think about how sad my life has to be in order to resort to this. Not like I could go if  I wanted to anyways. I can't afford it and my parents sure as hell don't believe in no shrinks, as they put it.

&#x200B;

The only way I'm comfortable in sharing my problems is anonymously on reddit, if that wasn't obvious already. Hell, isn't that the whole point of this subreddit? So that people like me can express their problems without being judged by people they know in real life? The internet is amazing, no doubt about that. But it still can't replace a living, breathing human being who you could feel, talk to, confide in, and just hug. Maybe they'll invent robots for that or something. 

&#x200B;

But yea that's the gist of it. Just another whiney reddit post about some dude who's gonna off himself in the next year. No biggie. God bless you all. peace.";actualhumanwaste

First time poster here. I don’t like to think I’m 
depressed and fight hard everyday to find a light and something to smile about. However something I struggle with that puts a huge weight on me is finding a significant other. I go to a college where it’s common to find the person you marry, I’ve even had a teach say in class “if you don’t graduate here having found someone you’ll spend you’re life with something is wrong with you”. I know that’s a messed up thing to say but it still hurts because I haven’t had anything close to a lasting relationship ever. 

I’ve had one girlfriend and that ended very badly, and not to sound pretentious but I feel like I’m an attractive guy, I come from an amazing family I’m proud of and I’m well off and I think I’m smart enough to do well for myself once I graduate in a few weeks. However I am surrounded by close friends who are all in relationships or engaged. I have 3 weddings of close friends coming up all my age, and heard talk of more engagements coming soon. I try my best to be fun and go out a lot and socialize, never with an express intention of striking up a relationship. However whenever I feel like I click I’m always told I’m not the person they’re interested in or just get flat out ignored.

What it boils down to is day in and day out I see people I love finding love or companionship, and while I don’t try to force it I try to always be myself and yet always end up alone. I’ve started to drink by myself to try and mitigate the pain and when I open up to those I am close to they don’t understand because they’ve been with their SO’s for over half a decade. It really makes me feel as if something is wrong with me and I am just not destined for that life, and I want that life. This has had a huge impact on my mental health and I feel as if nothing is worth trying at points. Sorry to ramble but I truly don’t have anyone to talk to about this and this community I feel will have someone who perhaps can relate and connect with me. Much love.";wax-ladrian

Well, I've never really spoken about this to anybody, but my life for the past decade has been the complete opposite of what I want it to be.

Every time I go on Facebook or open up a newspaper, I'm confronted with the possibilities of what my life would be like if I had done something a bit differently.  People I went to college/grad school with are now doctors, lawyers, investment bankers and professors.  Even the ""losers"" in my high school graduating class - they're with the clergy, or they're head coaches at prestigious private schools, commissioned officers in the Military, and head chefs at Michelin starred restaurants.

Meanwhile, I feel that I have accomplished nothing in life worth mentioning.

I keep thinking to myself, ""If only I'd stuck it out a bit longer,"" my life would have been a bit different.  I graduated top of my class in the top college prep school in my state, and went on to get a full scholarship (for the first year at least) to one of the top universities in the US.  It wasn't Harvard, Princeton, or Yale, but it was up there.  For a while, everything was going well and at some point (when my grandma and mom died) it came crashing down.

No, I don't blame their death for me screwing up.

I know it's not healthy to compare your life to that of other people, but it's precisely because at one point things were going so well, and that I had farther to fall, that things feel so painful in the long run.  I feel absolutely worthless, not because I think I was owed success, but because I let success slip through my fingers.  I hate myself for allowing myself to get comfortable in a job which was only supposed to be temporary, but instead turned into a four and a half-year rut.  A wasted life.

It's like the last 13 years of my life has been some bad dream.  If only I could wake up again in 2006.

Some days I wish that if some freak accident had happened years ago, hey at least I wouldn't be an embarrassment to myself and my family.  At least people would have said ""Hey, that Kaaarul guy was going places and it's sad that we lost him.""";Kaaarul11

I guess i thought being a teenager was something that you knew started, like one big moment; walking into high school for the first time freshman year. but i gave myself a break then because i didnt think the fun years started until i could drive. 6th grade is when i began feeling depressed. i was kind of an extrovert in elementary school - i was the weird kid who ate paper and was dating a spongebob character. i did it for attention, but middle school is when everyone else realized they werent little kids anymore and i was left behind. i was never “pretty”. i was never “thin” or obese, i was always tall, though, which is not something im confident about. 8th grade is when i tried to commit suicide. two years of having one friend who would only interact with me when one of her new best friends would waver out made me feel worthless. i was so self conscious that i stopped doing things all together, which made me think i could never hold down a job in the future. i hated the world - hell, i still kind of do! im now the kid who sophomores take pictures of and gossip about, but nothing more than “she was LOOKING AT ME!” why would i want to subject myself to a room full of those types of people, looking gorgeous as hell with their football boyfriends listening to trashy music all night when the only affect the night will have was a waste of money. but my friend is going, the one i was talking about. she’s been my friend for well over a decade, and we’ve always talked about stuff like this. its kind of the one big high school moment, and im gonna miss it because of my anxiety.
on top of that my brother came home. normally this would be awesome but he has a girlfriend now. she takes up all his time and the two of us just dont get along, and i usually hide in my room whenever she’s here - even though they’re in the basement. whenever she comes over, she doesnt go home until 3am, and i just feel uncomfortable and depressed when she’s here because i feel like my big brother likes her better than me. and this wasnt something i could prepare for - they just walked in the house, i had no idea he was coming home. i just feel so incredibly lonely right now, and im started to think about suicide - it would ruin everyones prom and my brother would feel awful for not spending more time with me, and i know its sick and twisted but that comforts me. i wish i wasnt such an awful person, i wish things like other peoples misery didnt give me pleasure, but i dont know how to stop it or what to do. im scared what i’ll be doing tomorrow night when everyone else will be at prom. i wanted to go to a concert, but id be too scared to go alone. i was gonna watch a bunch of movies but i already do that every weekend. my worst fear is that i’ll just be laying in my bed, too scared to go downstairs because my brother and his girlfriend are in the house, and i’ll just cry";mayaswellgohome

Anyway, last autumn my SO got depressed. Really, really bad. To the point of her being suicidal. And I can't fucking handle it. After years of being sick, I'm suddenly not only responsible for me, but for her as well and I'm the worst fucking support ever. I can't fucking do this and I can't get through to her.

My wonderful, beloved wife cries every night, she's having suicidal thoughts and I can't do fucking anything. So I get irritable, short with her. I'm very driven by solutions, and I know that doesn't work for her. She wants support and comforting. And I try, god knows I try. I try to be a good husband, and I fail. I fail miserably.

My mother has serious anger issues and is triggered by the very slightest thing. She isn't violent but verbally she would rip apart a 5yo like he was an adult.

I have two children 5 and 2. I notice my 5yo has slight anger issues (or I assume because I'm afraid I'm looking for something wrong). I don't know if mental...issues? (i don't know how to word it) can be passed on or not. I don't know if I should go to family therapy or if I'm overreacting or what to honestly think about it.

I can't find anything online that makes sense to me or that just doesn't scare the pants off me so I was hoping someone who might read this either works in a field that can help or knows about this and can maybe give me a hint or just something to look out for because I can't trust my own judgement (I think) because I don't know if I'm looking for something to be wrong or not?

But since a couple of months I've been using reddit and you know.. might as well try it out.

&#x200B;

I'm 25 years old, and I've lost myself because of depression. Since I was 15 I've been struggling with my sleeping habits and this resulted in continousley returning depressions. I didn't get to finish my studies (multiple times), I've lost my jobs (I was very good at them, but I physically couldn't handle them anymore because of my lack of sleep). And I've been on sick-leave(?) for almost 8 months now. I barely get by with the money I have and I'm not capable or even allowed to work. I've always had trouble finding my interests and never finished anything. 2 years of  athletics, 2 years of judo, 3 months of volley-ball, 3 weeks of soccer, etc. I read parts of a book, but rarely finish one. I started multiple hobbies with incredible motivation and lost the interest for no good reason pretty quick. I've tried meditation, hypnosis, etc.. gave up pretty fast. currently I'm on a maximum of antidepressents, melatonine and ambient. Take the antidepressents or ambient away and I'm going down a downards spiral pretty fast.

&#x200B;

I got a great physician, a sleep-specialist and a psychologist working as a team to help me out for a few months now and they don't really know what to do next. I've been to many specialists before and I don't seem to get any answers or results. I lack the spine to finish anything. I can't get myself to work-out. It takes all I have to get my daily chores done and that doens't always happen. It's because of my medication I'm able to go for a walk now and then and find the motivation to take a shower and see friends now and then. Currently I'm able to sleep, more even .. I'm addicted to it. Just as I'm addicted to nicotine and go out to party and drink till I almost black out way too much. I just can't seem to stop myself. I'm ashamed that all my friends are working, buying a house, getting married, starting a family.. while I'm sitting in a studio I can barely affort, with no money, no degree, no work, no hobbies, no interests, no goals, nothing to look forward to.

&#x200B;

It's not that I'm alone, I have a girlfriend that lives with me, I have a family that loves me and I have friends that I can go to. Still, I feel alone and left out..

&#x200B;

My psychologists said today that she has no idea what to do next. She said we could keep talking and go around in circles, but nothing will change if I don't even know what I want. But I no longer know who I am, what I want, where I want to go in life, because I just don't see a future life. I've never been someone talking about taking my own life. Even to I thought about it in flashes many times during my depressions, I always knew it wasn't something I would do. But lately, it starts to comfort me to know I could.. and that scares me most of all. 

&#x200B;

I really have no idea what to do next, and I really feel like I'm at the end of my road. Meanwhile, the financiel problems get worse by the week, my relation with my GF is breaking more every day, I isolate myself from friends and family more (except for when I go out and drink too much).

&#x200B;

It's as if I no longer control my life, and those who do control it have no idea what to do with it.

If I don't know, and they don't know .. what's the point?

A lot of insecurity and self-hatred came out, and I'm now moved back in with my parents (I had previously studied something else for a few months; my mom basically forced me to do that and I hated it, I got so lonely I couldn't stand it). I'm studying for entrance exams, but I honestly don't have any expectations. I feel like I'm missing out on life, so I try to isolate myself (seeing my friends doing so well in college is painful). I don't think I'm depressed, at least not at the moment because I don't actually feel as bad all the time like I did a few months ago; I don't really feel much right now. I don't have any expectations or hopes for the future (even if I got into medicine), I don't enjoy the stuff I used to like, I kinda just float through day after day, I'm constantly tired. I don't know if I'll ever actually like myself, or feel happier.

I've also been seeing a therapist, but I'm not sure it's helping.

Do you have any suggestions?

Thank you";throwaway525567

To every single one of those I've gone alone. I've never been to a movie with someone.

I have no one to go with, no girlfriend, friends or relatives

It's so shitty, everyone there is with someone, all you see is people talking, hugging, clinging onto each other and I'm just alone. The cashier always acts surprised when I ask for a ticket and makes sure with ""just one?"", the awkward walk home after the movie with all the thoughts about it bouncing through my head, just walking thinking about all the things I want to share, all the things I liked about it but no one to share it all with, only anonymously online on a forum or an image board but it's not the same.

When Star Ward 7 released back in 2015 I was 13/14 and I promised myself that I'm going to watch the last one with a girlfriend, nothing has changed, the last one is releasing this year. 

I've never had anyone in my life who cared about me truly, outside of parents. Never was anyone's best friend, anyone's crush, anyone's idol. Even when it seems like I'm with friends I'm always just a substitute until someone other frees up their time and I'm thrown away. I really hate my life.";mrjojoestar

(I Would never Commit suicide, I Just wanted to not exist anymore. It would make things easier, but I know Easier doesn't mean better...). 

That joke really didn't hit that well. One of my friends laughed and just kinda related to it and another friend just Said that I Really shouldn't Joke about stuff like that.

I’m almost 23 now and the older I’ve gotten the worse it’s seemed to have gotten. I’m really good at hiding it from everyone around me, but it gets really hard sometimes. Right now as I’m writing this I’m sitting in my room with the lights off and it’s around 5pm. I’ve probably been like this since 1pm. I can be bad about isolating myself even though I know it makes me slip further into feeling empty and alone. I convince myself that nobody wants to be around me even though deep down I know that’s not the case at all. I try things to combat it like working out or forcing myself to go out, but as soon as I’m alone it creeps back over me and I don’t know how to make it stop. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, but I don’t feel like I can tell the people around me. I know that I’d never act on it at this point in my life, but I know it’s not healthy to think dying would be the easy route. I’m constantly battling with myself. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone feels like there’s something that really helps them when they’re feeling like this.

Sometimes I try to talk about my feelings with him of hopelessness, sadness, feeling frustrated with feeling so down so much. He is very much a take action and fix it guy and kinda struggles in the empathy and holding space area. We always end up in some kind of argument because the way he sees it, I’m not doing enough to manage this or try to improve it on my own. I admittedly do not regularly take supplements and vitamins that would most likely help, and of course I could drink more water and eat healthier. I just think this feels like a huge slap in the face though. I end up feeling really alone with my issues. We just moved and I don’t have health insurance yet, and we do not have a high income right now, also therapy is scarce in my area so I am not seeing a therapist right now.

I'm really anxious and anti social. Doing something like this makes me really scared of what people will think or comment, but I just feel like right now in the middle of the night I gotta unload some things and maybe feel a bit better for once.

I can remember alot of things in my life, I can remember one or two best friends that I used to hang out with, it makes me kinda OK remembering something like that, so I guess I'll start with ruining that first.
My first best friend and I knew each other for several years, mind you this was actually in grade school which here is at ages 10 or something I dont recall. I trusted this person even after he started bullying me, I thought it was okay as long as I knew he was doing the right thing, that I must have messed up sometime for him to react like this. My first bad memory is when we had sewing class and I didnt hold the door for him and his 'new' friends, he almost killed me in that class right in front of the old teacher, it was the first time I defended myself and I got what I deserved I guess, he beat me until I was unconscious and when I woke up I was really confused, funny thing i remember this teacher sitting in her chair looking at me thinking ""come on kid, must you ruin my class you idiot"" look to her, I didnt realise it then but it's what I remember clearly, anyways I ran away from there and ran home. Well I made another mistake and told my parents what happened (they noticed of.course just looking at me I was really roughed up) and started fighting about what to do, now dont get me wrong my mother and dad are perfect, they love me alot and I love them too, I owe my life to them for not just giving up on me like they should've done.
I feel like I'm rambling and wasting your time, I dont know if anyone even reads this, I'm sorry.

For a couple of years I was being bullied alot in every school I went into, it made me more and more introverted and self conscious, I cant trust people, one minute your laughing and having a blast and then they're hitting you for not holding a door open for them. One minute your telling your friend you feel bad, that you know what they're going through and you dont know why and they talk behind your back what a fucking annoying ass i am, I really didnt feel bad at all during this time, it wasnt until high school I started trusting people again, made friends and even fell in love with my best friend. (Btw I'm a Male) starting high school I was being bullied for one or two days then it stopped and we were just friends...just like that,
I gotta be honest next part is a hard thing to talk about for me and I'm trying to write it without someone hearing me cry so they dont have to worry something's wrong with me. 

In second year of high school me and this girl were really good friends, we talked almost all the time for hours and hours just enjoying each others company, for more than a year, it wasnt until I fell in love I found out she had a boyfriend, I mean it wasnt something I needed to know before I realised I loved her but it still hurt somehow, first time I fell in love and I dont know how to handle it, and it made miserable, I talked to a friend after feeling like shit for a few months and he convinced me to tell her how I felt, which being such an idiot I did, I dont know if I regret doing it or not, but yeah..no I guess I dont regret it. She actually responded well, and we were friends still, it just felt pointless, I couldn't stop being in love I didnt know If you could stop that? Can you? This was also the time my father's boyfriend and her started drinking alot, I mean loads of everything and fighting, screaming, hitting and breaking..calling police at 1 at night or 4 in the morning, this is hard to write for me, like I'm literally writing this while they're fighting, well a little bit after since it's been like 20000 thousand words (again I'm so sorry for that)

I've been hit alot by 'friends' mentally bullied my entire life and laughed at for really no reason, but what broke me was when this girl stopped talking to me, just stopped, she didnt say why she just pretended I didnt exist, and it really broke me, I'm an emotional guy and I overthink alot, and I've never felt like that before and it made me break so much and forced me to look through all these 'happy' memories and realise that all my life I've never been happy or content, just a burden on people, I dont know how i made these people hate me but I did, I dont know why I fell for her when she probably didnt care about me. It really opened me up, I've been through all the above but love like that broke me and opened me up to see how shit it all is.

I'm extremely empty Inside, year 3 in high school was 3 or maybe 4 years ago and I've never been the same after those last 2 years in school, I remember my old self and I miss him and hate him so much, I hate feeling empty and. Not knowing what to do with my life, I dont know what to make of myself for a career, I dont know how to help my mom and dad feel better about anything, especially having such a worthless son like me. I suck at describing my emotions but it feels like I'm drowning and whenever something tries and light my way I get dragged further down. I'm scared alot and I'm anxious, scared of being in a room of more than 2 people because what if they laugh at me for breathing? Or what if I'm not silent enough, I feel like shit everyday, I can hardly pretend to people anymore, it's easy being fake and it hurts I'm so good that no one knows I'm dying inside, (I did tell my best friend and he's the only one that's actually been my friend, funny enough we fought once then became best friends, well he moved like 200km away and it made us both feel like shit but whatever, its life) it isn't really help, he has alot to think about, his 2 kids (we're 21 btw) his fiance and his work, I get it.

It makes me feel horrible because I know there's people who have it so much much worse than me and here I am, literally crying because I'm afraid all the time, afraid I'll find someone and fall again, which is a nightmare, I cant sleep more than 4 or 5 hours and when I do I wake up constantly, I hate talking to people, i enjoy being alone, to read and dream myself away into another world, it's fun to escape, it's the only joy I have in my life. I feel so bad for even writing here, But I cant do this right now, it hurts constantly and its physical pain, I cant be happy anymore because whenever I am happy like today, it has to balance itself out with some fucking stupid reason for people to drag me into a place where familys drinking alcohol and fuck I hate this so much, I really do,

How can i be mad at people and so quickly irritated when i should be happy people even speak to me. Do I keep being this selfish and put my problems here? To other people.. I'm stuck I dont know how to do this  it's been such a long time and every day feels like its dragging on forever. I've skipped alot of things, like fighting happening every other day with me on the phone for hours with police, panicked and unable to sleep then going to school, I forget telling you about a pressure I feel and it only goes away when I feel another physical pain, I wonder alot about what happens when we die, do God really exist? And if so if I were to hold it together until my family isn't here anymore can I just stop then? I can't hurt them then I hope. I really feel so tired, about everything, future, present, what I have to do to visit some stupid place, all the people I have to be around to get there and I panic, I just stay home, reading and fantasizing about what i want my life to be like. I do that alot, for hours I fantasize about what I want it to be and just letting the fantasy go.
I hate myself, I hate everything about myself. I hate how I feel my mother is 'annoying' when shes crying and I cant help but feel irritated and I'm so fucking horrible,
I feel empty and nothing helps, I feel like I'll never be able to feel a love like that, like I'll be too afraid to make a mistake like that again.

Damn this was my first ever post on anything..lol and I'm sorry again for doing this, I dont really imagine someone reading this, I guess I do like reading stuff like this because the pain and resemblances makes me feel something at least close to years ago.

Sorry have a good night? Day I guess and thanks for letting me vent.";Astriik

My depression developed during my university years. I fell in love with a fellow female friend, and growing up with Christian belief I was deeply in denial and ashamed of my attraction. Also I was completely inept with managing emotions, therefore every negative emotions I felt, I would try my best to avoid feeling it by distracting myself. Obviously this just made things worse as the negative feelings just felt more intense when they happen and my tolerance for them becomes lower. So along with the inability to manage negative emotions, I constantly didn’t have the motivation to study therefore my university performance suffered as well. Therefore with thr constant feeling of unrequited love, disappointment, shame, insecurity and guilt, I got to the point that I don’t care anymore. At first it felt liberating but then I felt numb. When I stopped caring, it also felt I don’t have anything to look forward to in life. It was the most terrible feeling i’ve experienced. To just exist and continue living, with a massive gaping whole in my heart. When night came, the emptiness would haunt me and I would cry myself to sleep. I have also completely cut myself off from my friends, as I felt undeserving of being their friend.  I then realized my mistake. Giving up and not giving a fuck is not the solution. Not giving a care about anything not only removed my ability to feel negative feelings, it also removed my ability to experience genuine positive feelings. Therefore I decided I’m going to change things as I cannot bear being in that situation anymore.

The first thing I did that made a positive change in me was to watch a lot of psychology video, and reading a lot of psychology articles. When extreme sadness starts to overwhelm me, I would go on youtube and learn more about emotions. I would then felt calm and a little hopeful every time I learn something new about myself. 

The following are the most helpful lessons i’ve learned from the psychology videos  and articles.
1. Befriend your emotions. Emotions are there to help you and guide you. They are there to let you know what is missing in your life, therefore your needs. So whenever I felt a negative emotion, i tried to feel it instead of avoiding it. For example, when the emptiness would start to haunt me, I would dissect it to its elementary emotions. Then I found out that the emptiness is a mixture of loneliness, sadness, fear of being not good enough, fear of not having in control of my life, etc. This made it easier for me to confront my emotions as I now understood what i am exactly feeling. 
2. Know exactly what you are feeling. Like what i said above. It would be easier to confront your emotions if you know what they are. So define them and analyse why you are experiencing them. 
3. Your emotions are trying to point out to you that you have a need that has to be fulfilled. Therefore knowing exactly what and why you are experiencing such emotions would help you understand what it is you need. For example when you realize that there is loneliness there, that means you need a companion at that moment. So the solution to that is to reach out to friends or people. 

Confronting my emotions wasn’t easy at first. The positive change was slow and gradual. As i slowly became a little more comfortable with negative feelings, I start to also allow myself to feel positive emotions little by little. 

The next thing that made a significant change in me was when my friend visited me during my low times. I was still feeling ashamed and guilty for not contacting my them. I hated myself so much and blamed myself for everything. My friend however told me that it was okay and told me that she loves me no matter what, even if i ghosted her and i’m feeling like a loser, she still wants to be friends with me. It was such a profound moment for me as i completely believed that i am not worthy of love, as i can’t even love myself. That was the moment i understood what love is. It’s when someone likes you even with your faults. At that moment i  realized i was lovable.

I still felt lost, and sometimes the sadness would still feel unbearable, but it wasn’t as bad as the year before. Therefore the next thing i did that helped me improve was to get to know myself. Therefore i learned about core values. I now know that my main core values are honesty and trust. They are however very difficult to practice. But i would compare myself with my past self, and saw that even though i slip every mow and then, i was still improving.

I also learned the importance of looking after my physical health. Breakfast is important, proper sleep is important, good hygiene is important and exercise is important. So i joined a gym, but i’m still trying to have proper sleep and not skip breakfast. I also realised the secret to success is balance. I should take care of both my physical health and mental health every day. 

Now i am back on track and i think i’m finally over my depression. The next project i have to do is to plan my goals and determine what would really make me happy. I know this is a really long post, but i hope you have learned something from it. I wish you the best.";shepvasnor

I want to apologize to her for annoying her and stressing her out, but by apologizing to her, I make her more stressed and more annoyed, and the I want to apologize for that,but then Im scared she’ll leave me and just tell me to fuck off.

Ive lost plenty of friends and friendships,but Im too scared to lose her as a friend. Shes a friend over Reddit and my best friend.

I'm stuck in the middle of this toxic household and its ugly. I can't leave because he needs me but I can't stay because its killing me. I don't know what to do and I'm back in survival mode.

Finally, I was home alone; I had the means, motive and opportunity to kill myself. This wasn’t an impulse decision; I have been contemplating it for a long time. 

I thought about overdosing on my medicine, but I heard that can really mess you up and still not kill you. So I settled on a good old-fashioned hanging. I grabbed the rope from my room and started to head to the basement so I could finally end it, but then I saw it. My dog was looking at me; it was like she could sense what was about to happen, she just looked so sad (she’s usually really happy). So I decided to cuddle with her before hanging myself as a sort of last goodbye. As I layed there with my dog, I couldn’t help but think how sad and confused she would be if I died. 

In the end, I chickened out (obviously). I’m so tired of only staying alive for the sole reason of not upsetting anyone else, but I guess that’s just how my life has to be. Anyways, I am grateful to my dog but also mad at myself for being such a coward.

It's more of a dead inside/nothing matters during depressed periods and during my manic phases just happy and overexcited/up for anything attitude.
Out of frustration I stopped taking my meds cold turkey the end of March and it seemed to help. Mind clearer, less erratic decision making but a month on I'm beginning to think that maybe it was a mistake.

I’ve noticed I’m becoming dumber. I was “gifted” as a kid and excelled in early school and even a bit in high school. I mean, I never really tried, so I never actually picked up the practical skills I should have. If I go to college I’m fucked. But, at this point, I’m feeling incredibly stupid. Few years ago, I could pick up new things so easily. Now, I’m a year behind in high school. I’m a senior, and barely know algebra, despite math being what I excelled at as a kid. I think my language skills are genuinely becoming worse. My grammar is getting shittier and I forget how to actually spell things a lot more now. I struggle picking up directional awareness IE learning roads and stuff. What’s simple for most, feels so complicated for me. The only things I “enjoy” doing, I’m utter shit at, I don’t improve, and it just makes me feel even more awful when I fail constantly. I dont even know what i'm actually good at, probably nothing at this point. On top of that, my body already feels like it’s falling apart. I ain’t even gunna talk about social skills. I don’t have a job, yet I dread one. Maybe I’m incredibly fucking lazy, but whatever, that’s a whole different topic.

I really don’t know what to do. It’s hard to even “comprehend” what I’m thinking/feeling. I can’t actually put it on paper 99% of the time and this pisses me off so much. It’s like one of those fiberglass splinters you can’t find or get out, but it’s in the back of my mind. Some little undertone to everything, that keeps eating away at me. Speaking of little undertones, anyone else feel like they have multiple ""minds"" in them fighting for control or something? Like, I want to cease so bad, but then at times I think about how we all die, and get extremely sad visualizing myself in a grave, with family nearby or something. Man, I think it would have been better if humans were never a thing. Hell, even if life was never a thing. Existence is so cruel. 

Even if I “get better” I don’t know what direction or purpose I will have. I really just don’t want to exist. This world is trash. I don’t know man. I don’t know anything. Sometimes you think you know yourself, but when you realize you dont, its really fucking annoying.

Everywhere I go, Im just looking for something, some hope I dont know, an answer, a secret little formula that will fix everything. I know it doesnt exist. I know each time that tad of ""hope"" gets squashed it makes me feel like shit even more. I'm anticipating something, some movie shit or something. But it just doesnt happen in real life. I dont know why I keep looking. I dont know what im even doing. Writing this, i've lost most of my train of thought and its just ramble now. Theres so much im missing, and its really irritating me.

No real reason for writing this other than to get it all off my chest,

Not really a new thing either as it's been going on since I was 13ish (I'm now 27) but it's something I've only really come to terms with and tried to deal with in the past 2years,    

First of all let me start by telling you all that it really does fuck you up, it will isolate you, and it will strip you of everything. It's almost impossible to deal with and you only really understand if you've been there yourself. Sort of a constant feeling of impending doom mixed with a fear of social interaction and anger towards other people, the slightest thing will send you over the edge and into your little dark hole. 

For me thinking back it probably started when I was 13 and my parents split up and I didn't tell any of my friends. I tried to hide it, thought I would be bullied because of it and couldn't speak to my parents about it, then the fact My mother never really bothered with me as she was always in bed on prescription drugs or depressed about one thing or another. So I would skip school drink and get in trouble with the cops. At age 14 I got seriously attacked and as a result lost whatever self confidence I had left, everything scared me after this and I would only leave the house to buy weed with the £4000 I got in compensation. To be fair to him my father was in and out of my life during this time and did try but Tbh I didn't wanna know him,  By age 15 everything had progressed into smoking around £30 of weed a day I didn't go to school missed nearly all of my GCSE and was set for life to be a fucking failure. Not going to school had a really fucked up effect on me as I lost all my friends I had from childhood and was to scared to go make more. Isolation set in and I would speak to nobody other than my brother who bullied me with his mates for days at a time...growing up I never really had a family or friends, then i got alopecia when I was 18 lost all my hair, dropped out of college because of this and isolated myself from the outside world...Early 20s where pretty fucking rough aswell, the less said the better as I don't really remember all that much from age 20-23, I smoked £24,000 worth of weed......there went my house deposit.......Roll on age 24 when I somehow  got a good job but left it due to depression amongst other things, And have just about been keeping myself afloat ever since. 

All in all Depression has ruined a good half of my life through one means or another be it the knock on effects, or the direct result of being an antisocial fucktard. 

But I guess It's never to late to change, being in the mindset where you can recognise the issues is half the battle.

I used to be a motivated soldier, but now I am nothing but a worthless person who sucks at everything. After getting kicked out of the Army, I spiraled into my lowest of my lows. All I ever want to do now is drink to numb myself and self-harm to distract myself from my emotional pain with physical pain. 

Being depressed has made me dumber than before. I can not allow myself to go to school due to the fear of failing, thus causing myself more pain with debt. I am stuck at a job where I don't make enough to go by, also surrounded by coworkers I dislike. 

 My friends who I have no longer talked to due to my work schedule makes me feel alone. I can't make new friends because of my work schedule.

 I can't quit my job because I can't find a new job. Me being a veteran puts me as ""overqualified"" for the most basic job. School isn't also an option (if you read the 3rd paragraph, you would know).

My hobbies such as photography has destroyed my self-esteem and confidence to go take pictures. 

I've been wasting a lot of money on fast food because my roommates horde the kitchen and my work schedule won't allow me to cook because I come home at 1AM, so I can't cook as it'll wake them up. I can't wake up early because I'll be exhausted and my shift is 10 hours. Sleep is too precious for me. I can't move out because I do not have enough money to pay for a 1st + 2nd month rent + deposit. 

I've been sleeping on my floor as I'm afraid of buying a bed in case I ever get evicted or decide to move out. I only have a small car and I don't have enough money to pay for movers or have any friends to help me move out. I only shower/brush my teeth once a week because I'm just never motivated to do so. 

My family doesn't know what I've been going through because growing up Filipino, mental health is something that is culturally never talked about. They will never understand. It doesn't matter because they live in the Philippines, while I'm here living in Seattle with a roommate that I hate. I was never close with my family anyways.

If I told anyone how hard I try to do those things they'd laugh at me. Yet here I am trudging along the best I can with the coping mechanisms I've developed living a lonely depressed life. 

&#x200B;

I keep up a mask of ""normalcy"" around others because if they see the real me they end up getting mad and leaving me. The only ""friends"" I have left are ones I keep at arms length and keep up a mask around them. Now even my husband is sick of me and berates me for not doing what he thinks I should do. If I talk to him too much about my worries and fears he just gets mad at me now. I just feel so alone in life, so hopeless and lost. Maybe I'm meant to be alone because I'm so horribly unpleasant to be around. Can't really blame the people in my life, I hate myself and am sick of my shit too. 

&#x200B;

I'll keep going along the best I can, but holy fuck life is so hard. Nothing brings joy or happiness, nothing is a distraction from the pain. Nothing will be reprieve from the endless storm that is depression. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR I'm a pathetic depressed waste of space and this post is just pointless depression fueled rambling. At least people on this sub can understand the way I feel if no one else in my life can :(";tiredoflifetoohard

I went to primary school where I was classified as an idiot by a single test. As a result I was pretty much permanently stuck in the bottom sets in all subjects with kids who didn't care where their life went.

The result? I was bullied mercilessly. When I finally cracked and lost my shit I was reprimanded for ""swearing"".

By this point nearly everyone in my family had died. Only ones left are me, my mum and her sister.

I did my A-levels where I fucked up even more. Depression became an eating disorder, Anorexia Nervosa. Something that no one thinks happens to men. I was nearly sectioned. Grades were shit.

I've had therapy and group therapy. It didn't help really. I'm at a healthy weight but my head is fucked beyond belief.

Since I don't have the grades to do anything I'd enjoy in university I took an apprenticeship. Worst mistake of my life. It's a miserable MSP with shit hours, shit pay, shit managers and more work than I could ever complete. It's beyond stressful and I have no time to complete my apprentice work. The certifications don't even get me anywhere either. I'm being reprimanded for taking a week's holiday currently. When I'm back I'll be buried work.

I'm just going to be working everyday with no actual gratification for what I do other than making someone else richer. I always wanted to work in the emergency services but that pipe dream got flushed a long time ago.

I don't have anyone to support me. Mum is tired of me at this point and I don't blame her at all. No one knows what to do with me.

My few friends who supposedly supported me went to university and found new lives. I've reached out but they just don't respond. I've never even been close to a romantic relationship and I have doubts if I ever will with my mindset.

I just don't enjoy anything anymore. Constant migraines too.";andmenwhomakeit

864;Feeling lost;1;bhqt1o;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhqt1o/feeling_lost/;0;2019-04-26 17:06:17;"I was diagnosed w/ MDD about a year ago and have been taking an SNRI and wellbutrin for almost that whole time. I feel like it helped at first, but lately the depression is cutting right through the meds. I feel like I'm wearing a lead jacket. It's hard to breathe, hard to sleep, hard to concentrate. I'm exhausted all the time. 

&#x200B;

Doc just increased my dose of wellbutrin, so we'll see if that helps. I'm going to start seeing a therapist as well. I've got to do something. I can't remember the last time I was just happy (without the help of alcohol - which I'm not supposed to drink). I'm extremely worried about my marriage. I feel disconnected from my spouse, maybe no longer in love. I really don't want to give up the life I have which is very comfortable. I have great kids, a nice house, and a generally pretty easy life. None of that seems to help how I feel, though. 

&#x200B;

On the other side of the coin, I fantasize regularly about being single again. I love the idea of living my own life. Dating again after a decade with the same person sounds really appealing. Being able to drink again would be amazing. I also love the idea of having my own place where I know where everything is just how I want it and don't have to answer to anyone else. I'm on the verge of just jumping into this new life, but I feel like I might be making a huge mistake. I also know that I can't keep doing the same thing I've been doing. 

&#x200B;

I've felt so lost the last few months, especially the last few weeks. I feel like I can't make decisions about anything. I'm terrified of what consequences may come from walking away from my family, but I'm also terrified to stay when I'm this miserable. I can't remember the last time I felt happy. I've dealt with passive suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember (I've never acted on them). I don't look forward to *anything* anymore. I try new hobbies all the time. It's great for the first day, then I don't want to do it anymore. I don't like hanging out with anyone. I have few friends and never spend time with any of them. I hate that I can't drink alcohol, as that was one of the few things that brought light to my life. I'm also a little worried that it may not just be MDD. I definitely have had days that resemble hypomania, but I have no idea if that's really what it was. Ever since I was very young, I have felt like I don't fit in with any one group of people. I've always felt like I was from another planet or something. I don't think that matches with reality, though. I get along with people just fine, but I feel like something is just not right.

865;Trying to cope with reality;1;bhqo0z;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhqo0z/trying_to_cope_with_reality/;0;2019-04-26 16:53:43;"After struggling for months I've finally been able to get a grip on my addictions.. I've given up on my gaming addiction which has been dominating my life ever since my early teens.. Besides gaming I also gave up on smoking and alcohol, currently sober for around 2 months now.. I can't say I've fully relapsed because the urge to delve back into these activities is still there a lot of the times (especially when I'm very tired or stressed out).

I've really tried my best these last few months but it's just been dreadful. Giving up these things also meant that I had to give up on pretty much all of my friends groups because they are just triggers that would pull me back into my old lifestyle.

&#x200B;

Moving on last few weeks were just terrible reality checks. Currently in my mid-twenty's and realizing the fact of how bad I've handled situations in the past simply put tears to my eyes.. Gaming always worked as a painkiller for me. All for the entire purpose of suppression, simply to suppress all the terrible thoughts that haunted my mind.

&#x200B;

No suppression meant that I had to deal with all of these monstrous things: my ruined self-image, crooked teeth, posture problems, lack of general knowledge, bad social skills, terrible anxiety & mental issues.

&#x200B;

I'm slowly trying to patch myself up but it's such a mess.. I've underestimated the recovery process.. It might take me years to properly get back on my feet (if I don't relapse that is).

And it's hard because at the same time I'm trying to get back into college to try and get a degree and simply the fact that I'm still carrying all this emotional weight with me isn't making things any easier.. I have a really hard time to connect with other classmates because I'm a lot older than most of them and also kind of awkward.. Currently I haven't really made any friends. Most lunch breaks I just spend alone suppressing my thoughts with music while I try to even eat something and it´s just fucking me up..

&#x200B;

To wrap things up.

Right now I’m at this stage of my life where some of my youth friends are already settling & buying a house. Where others have already had multiple relationships, finishing college, have created numerous options for themselves.

While I.. I´m still dwelling in no mans land, living in a desperate environment, with no real friends, no real connection & no real sense of purpose.

&#x200B;

I just don´t understand how I became so disconnected of it all and why nobody talks about these things. It makes me feel so alone.. While I’m sure there are people that must feel somewhat to the way I do..";Driftwood783

My girlfriend left me after my anxiety got so bad I had the worst panic attack of my life after a date with her resulting in me in the hospital. It was after I got out of the hospital and told her they said I only had a panic attack and it wasn't a seizure or something worse wrong with me that she decided to break up with me. So I was alone I lost a girl I'd been so close to and spent so much time with for years and I was so fucking depressed and anxious I wanted to die and I was concerning my family and friends, nothing was going well. My ex threw a party the next day and started talking to all some of my closest guy friends so I was even more alone than ever as my friends cut me off when they started talking to her. I kept falling further and further down but I decided to just sit alone and write and write. I wrote songs, I wrote story's about my life, I also wrote random thoughts. I wrote about everything and decided to start recording to let out my emotions and feel like I have someone to talk to. I liked a couple of my songs and decided to release them for friends to hear instead of just myself. They all loved my music and sent it to some people so they could listen and everyone was loving it and more and more people started to listening and telling me how much they like it. I was so happy and my dad was supportive of me and I was finally starting to feel a lot better about myself even though I am still battling severe anxiety and also depression but between music and seeing and talking to a therapist life was looking brighter.

Until today when I decided to smoke weed in my house. It was to help boost my appetite and help me sleep as I haven't been able to do either lately and it's the only thing that helps. My dad smelled it and said my life is ruined and he isn't taking me to hospitals or believing me when I say I have anxiety or depression (I am diagnosed with severe anxiety, GAD, social anxiety etc and mild depression) but he thinks its all from weed now even though I was completely sober for 4 months leading up to my panic attack and hospital visit. Now I don't know what to do I can't record any more music in my house and that's all that would help me and only thing that made me feel like I'm worth something. I really feel like I've lost it all now I'm probably gonna get kicked out and have even less and of course it's after I finally found something that made me feel happier and that I enjoy.

The thing I want most in life right now is to be admitted into a mental hospital.


In Quebec, you can only get into a mental hospital if you are severely suicidal or if you are a danger to others. I have always lied to my doc and psychiatrist to make them believe I was better, now they don't believe me when I tell them I need HELP. They think that I am getting better.


I'm thinking about attempting suicide just so I can get some damn help. What are the best ways to knock myself out and wake up in an hospital? What if I start breaking shit and getting myself arrested, maybe they would help me.


Worst part is I kinda feel fine half the time and I hate myself for feeling like shit. I don't want to burden others.

But now since Saturday I have been very anxious that I may start being very sad or start harming myself. But, these things have been freaking me out and distracting me from doing things. I didn’t have these thoughts until I saw this video. But over the past few days I have been fearing that I am becoming sad or when I am laughing I think that it isn’t real. And I am having intrusive thoughts about self harm/suicide but that makes me really scared because I’m worried that my mind will force me to act on these thoughts. I still am sleeping kinda normally, have the same hygiene and going to school and talking to my friends but these thoughts are always on my mind and distracting me. Every time I try to chill out and listen to music I get distracted by these stupid thoughts. I have also now been very sensitive to things talking about depression/suicide and also occasionally irritable. I get really anxious that I may do something even though I probably won’t. Also since seeing some starter pack while looking up depression and not knowing I saw one about not enjoying music which really freaked me out. Maybe I just can’t focus on music cause I’m anxious But I have no idea cause my mind is really screwing around with me. I also have been kinda tired but I still sleep the same hours as usual.

Stopped taking my meds because I thought I was better (spoiler alert: I’m not). 

I went to a club with some friends last night, the voice in the back of my head told me to get really drunk and do loads of drugs, partly to numb the pain and partly to play Russian roulette with my body and see if it would tip me over the edge. I drank and drank and met a drug dealer outside the club, I couldn’t even walk or talk at the peak of the night, but my head was on fire. I’ve never felt so low, I just wanted to end it all. 

At the end of the night when I was coming down a bit I was swaying and must have fallen into my friends and their boyfriends a number of times. However one friend (A) didn’t like it, she told her boyfriend that if I spoke to her one more time she would punch me (because I leant on to her boyfriend to stabilise myself). So that is one friend lost.

I guess you could call what I did a cry for help, I wanted someone to notice I wasn’t okay. In the taxi on the way home I got an overwhelming feeling of depression and became extremely suicidal. I was uncontrollably crying and my friend (Z) consoled me. I told her I was going to go home and end it all, that I couldn’t do it any more and I wouldn’t see her again but thanked her for everything. She panicked and told her boyfriend (J) that it wasn’t safe for me to go home. Whilst this is happening everyone is worried about me (understandably) but A is just asking everyone for the money for the taxi and if we’re almost home, which made me feel shit and like a burden. 

Z and J take me to the hospital at 3am, I don’t end up being seen until 8am. Luckily my boyfriend (who works nights) came and met us at the hospital at 7am. I was so worried he was going to be annoyed and angry at me but he wasn’t. He looked after me. 

We went back to his house after being at A&E and I felt empty. I still do. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe it will just take time.

I’ve never been as low as last night, I think if they let me come home on my own I wouldn’t have woken up today. I need to thank Z and J and my boyfriend properly for making me feel loved. And I don’t know what to do about A. I still don’t know if it was my fault or not. I felt like I had no one, now I know I have a couple of people that want what’s best for me.

He died around 6 months ago with my mum witnessing all of the traumatic moment whilst with him.

After all these tragic things that happened to her it seemed a switch was flipped to her feeling depressed and currently once or twice a week having a anxiety/panic attack. whilst having the attacks she is normally crying about how my brother's death is her fault,feeling scared,suicidal in hope of seeing my brother again and having nightmares at night. sometimes whilst trying to calm her down she starts to scream for a while and doesn't recognise me which leads to her pushing me away. 

when i feel she is about to have a panic attack i notice she doesn't reaction with whats around her, can't control her voice whilst talking and trying to have a happy facial expression to not make me worry when i know she isn't alright.For a month she has been having home therapy and its going alright but she still has the attacks here and there.

I came to ask for any advice to try and help her because am young and don't really know how to handle this situation. i talk to her regularly to assure her nothing is her fault and that she is someone who is strong. I go out with her for fresh air and praying and such to distract her.

To live my life.""

I’ve had depression and anxiety since high school. I am very paranoid about medication. I’ve tried Lexapro (lowest dose cut in half) and another pill I can’t remember the name of in high school and I felt like a suicidal zombie and had to stop after two days on both meds. I feel like I feel every negative side effect from medicine and cannot feel not like myself or I completely freak out. I can’t “wait out” bad side effects because I panic and think I’m going to lose memory, screw up at my job or be generally out of control over myself. I have been doing okay without medicine for years, or so I thought, living too safely, not having much of a life and on autopilot so I can’t say I’ve progressed much in life, and it’s caught up to me and the last few weeks I’ve been extremely depressed, numb, and also anxiety ridden and all of my soothing techniques and self care have not helped whatsoever. I tried taking L-Theanine since it’s over the counter and it helped but gave me extreme brain fog after which I believe elevated my depression. I’m at a loss. I feel at this point I may need medicine and I can’t continue living this quality of life without help but I’m absolutely terrified of losing myself or medications making me worse.

My teacher once said, “I was trying to figure out what colour you weren’t wearing today,but then I saw the little bit of red on your socks.”

I never forgot that, it stuck. Those words are still with me because it was nice to feel appreciated in a way.

In grade 1 I went over to my teacher’s house. She had a greenhouse in her back yard and goldfish in a little pond too. She invited my dad and I over and we walked around back there and I remember her showing my dad a drawing that I had done, and it was for a project that was like, “If you could be any superhero, what would you be?” and I said that I would want to be my mom. I felt really important that day.

I miss grade 9 and getting on my bus in the morning. I felt so alive. And ready. I was so ready for grade 9. The vulnerability that I felt when I used to talk to people for the first time, I need it back. I miss feeling so absolutely anxious and happy. I miss being upset with my friends and crying that I could possibly lose them. I just miss sitting in a classroom and listening to a teacher and actually learning. I miss learning how to play the piano.
 I wish I listened to my heart, I regret not putting myself out there and making friends that were actually kind. I should have stuck with piano. I’ve been so mean, my whole life. I use people constantly and ask for so much in return.

I feel the need to be guided constantly. Why when I’m feeling like this I just become a baby and do stupid things? I really need to work on being nicer. I have such a short temper with the people that I love the most, and I feel awful about it. I wish I just said what I thought, and did the things I want to do.

I poked my head out of the water for the first time in a few years and just wanted to share with people who understood.

Had a depression years ago, healed after a few years, made a point of being the happiest person on earth after. I was sure I could never have depression again, thought I was cured. 
When my little sister showed signs of depression, I made her move with me, took her to the doctor and helped her through it for a year. I felt after being through it I was the best person to help her.
It was tough. But somehow I knew what she needed to hear, what to do, and very slowly, and with a tough fight from her side too, my lil soldier came back on her feet and left my home to carry on with her life. She’s great now, knows herself much better, accepts her limits and is the most compassionate and funny and smart lady out there. 
I didn’t notice at first but doing this got me lower than usual. After 3 years it only got worse, to the point I started again thinking “What’s the point in all this” “I’m so tired, if I could just get hit by a car it would be great” kinda thoughts and went to the doctor, again, on meds, again, psychologists appointment, so disappointed in myself.
Yet apparently if helping my sister took too much out of me (I have no regrets though) it also helps me getting better. Now when I have dark thoughts or low days, I listen to my negative thoughts much less, instead I hear the things I used to tell HER when SHE was going through it. I’m talking to myself with the same love and care I used for her. 
After months of staying in bed and weeks of “Ok today I go back running again” but not doing it, today, I finally went. 
And it felt awesome.
I had irrational happiness the whole while, the colors were beautiful, my dog was thankful and I felt I was on the right path, that it would get better. 

I just wanted to share this. We will get through this. Be gentle to yourself. It might be impossible even to consider it from now but it IS worth the fight, and the life after won’t be like the life before, it will be BETTER.

I don’t know. 

At this exact time last year I was at the worst point in my life. I was raped, and had to not only work with, but talk to my rapist every day, without being able to tell anyone. My friends all called me a liar and I lost literally everyone. My boyfriend cheated on me, because I wouldn’t have sex with him due to my recent trauma. I lost my job, I was failing all of my classes, and most days couldn’t even get out of bed for school. I never could sleep or eat, and it was a big achievement if I managed to shower three times a week (gross, I know). 

I thought, I can’t do this. It might get better sure, but I can’t stick it out. I just can’t. I would rather cut my life short than endure this hell another day. It was to the point where I was at such odds with my own head, literally going back and forth if I should take my own life, that I was having hallucinations. 

But I stuck it out. I don’t know why. I don’t know how. It literally was like, I’m going to lay in this bed and not move, because that means I’m not going to do something drastic. I stuck it out, for a long time, and I’m not gunna lie friends. It sucked. It wasn’t like “I went to therapy and did some deep breathing and I was happy again”. It was kind of just a cycle of distracting myself until something good happened. And it did!

In the fall I met someone who changed my life. I’ve been going to the same school, same small town all my life, and I thought, there’s no way I’ll meet someone new. But I did. I broke up with my shitty, cheating boyfriend (who was so fucking toxic, I didn’t even realize how much it was hurting me), surrounded myself with an entire new group of people, started listening to new music, got a new job, graduated high school early, and became a person that my younger self would have been proud of being. I because not only my own person, but a better person. And I deserve that kind of happiness. 

I’m now with this new person, my best friend, someone I really love. I never knew it could feel like this. I was in such a long term relationship that I just accepted that you’re supposed to feel sad, and depressed, and not good enough sometimes. But you aren’t. And I’m so glad I had the respect for myself to get out of that situation. I’ve been through hell; suicide attempts, bullying, eating disorders, self harm, you name it. But despite all of that, I still came out the other side alive and okay. And I feel the best I’ve felt in a really long time. My depression isn’t gone, and some days are really really hard. But I know now that if I can get through ALL of that shit, it’s always going to be okay one day.

You craved your parent(s) attention by studying well, your self-esteem depended on your grades, your worth as a humanbeing depended on it. But something was always wrong with you. You weren't free to express yourself, because all your energy went into being perfect to gain love that your parents never gave you. They didn't know how. And in adulthood, you've become officially mentally ill. You got tired. You became depressed. Now you feel like you have no personality. You have never put yourself first in your life, because it feels weird. You want to be invisible.

The quote comes from Ovid during his exile and has spoken to me ever since college. I am an outsider. A pariah. He who walks blindly alone. Or am I?

At first I was ashamed for being different. I never “fit in.” My family always asked why I wasn’t happy. I was miserable and tried to end it numerous times. 

Then out of nowhere I began to appreciate the unique wavelength I ran on. I saw and perceived things in a vastly different way than others. I began to own my “unique superpowers,” as my therapist put it. I’ve accomplished amazing things for actually taking the *road less traveled* and I’ll be the first to say, screw you depression, but kind of thanks at the same time. 

We are all dealt a hand in life. Amazing, shitty, so-so. We either fold or push all in. What I realized is, your cards don’t necessarily matter. It’s how you play the game. 

I’ve been diagnosed with autism, Tourette’s, multiple learning disabilities, MDD boarding on Bipolar, and much more. These aren’t bugs—they are features. Features that created the optimal environment to kick my ass into gear and do better than “the norm.” Was it easy? Absolutely not. However, when I taught I always told my students if it was easy then everyone could do it. 

The tattoo is on my bicep because my former temporary coping strategy was to bury my head in my hands and sob during an episode. I now open my eyes, see what I inscribed on my body, and remember I choose my own path and not the flock. 

I am proud to be a barbarian and you should be as well. 

If ANYONE ever needs to talk, I am willing to listen. 

Love ❤️

&#x200B;

For a few months now, after give or take 6 years of, i'd say, severe depression (24yo now), i've been able to say that im no longer depressed.

Which is 100% a good thing.. right? Here's the thing, while i was depressed i started really getting into all sorts of art.

To a point where i could scroll through aethetic vaporwave digital art and drawings and what not, and just get mesmerized by the colours and feeling i'd get from it.

&#x200B;

But now after a while of feeling better, im noticing myself not feeling this ""feel"" anymore while scrolling through those subreddits/instagram feeds.

Its not only the art i was getting into, i've been loosing interest in the games i used to enjoy playing too..

&#x200B;

So despite feeling a lot better, i'm still rather lonely, and i enjoy less than i used to and having less to do in my spare time leaving me rather bored a lot of the times.

I'm not really interested in a lot and im quite the anti-social guy having a hard time getting used to my surroundings.

I've got some good friends, though i can't really call any of them a best friend, i hardly talk to them except for when we hang out.

I try to avoid hanging out with just 1 or 2 friends since i know i won't have a lot of input to whatever we're doing or talking about.

&#x200B;

Most of my weekends are me in my room drinking beer while my friends all have a girlfriend or other groups they can hang out with that i don't know.

&#x200B;

I'm planning on going to my doctor soon about some physical stuff that i need checked and i will ask about this aswell..

&#x200B;

That is really it for now.. any golden tips for improvement would be fantastic!

One 8, and the other 15. Like my title said. I need advice. On how yo respond. How to act. How to be around him. Should I even bring it up?

 I found out yesterday that my little brother (15) while on his way to school, went to our old home and tried to kill himself. 
He failed, thank God, and went to school as normal. We found out about it once a counselor called him in simce he had to turn something in. That's when he told her. She then called our parents and told them.

Hes been in a hospital or psychiatric ward, one of those, since yesterday and is being released today as they say he needs a therapist. They told us he since calmed down. How do I act? Do i even bring it up? 
Some key points. He doesnt want me or my youngest brother to know about this. Even told my parents that went to visit him to tell us he went camping. Obviously I know but my youngest brother doesnt. I found 2 journals in his bag that both contained goodbye letters to us dated 04/01/19 and another around 01/16/19. The journals also have entries dating back as 07/12/18. Do i ask him about them?

Little bit of backstory: I was on SSRI's and beta blockers a few years ago but decided to stop them as I was feeling a lot better with where I was at, and my BF did help a lot.

However, recently I have been really struggling with my anxiety especially around my friends. I still have some bad days with my depression where I don't have much motivation, but I feel like it isn't too bad atm. I went to the doctors yesterday about my anxiety and he wasn't much help... He suggested taking sertraline, which is an SSRI, and gave me a prescription for that. However, I don't want to take antidepressants again as I don't want to rely on them and take them everyday. I just wanted something that would help with my anxiety as I have looked up these tablets and they don't say anything about taking them for anxiety disorders. I have also referred myself to get some therapy or help to deal with my anxiety.

I'm just a bit stuck in what to do at the moment. I have booked another doctors appointment for next week, but I don't want this to go on much longer as I have finals soon and don't want to be stressed about finding the right medication etc.

I'm just a bit lost in what to do so any advice or guidance will help!";stoned_meerkat

My birthday was also two days ago, and I saw a video of myself and I just gained so much weight. It’s kind of destroyed my self confidence all over again. 

My family has been so happy that I don’t want to kill myself upon waking up anymore. I don’t really have any close friends that I can confide in.

919;I think I have a better understanding now of why some people choose to cut themselves;14;bhoo19;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhoo19/i_think_i_have_a_better_understanding_now_of_why/;4;2019-04-26 14:00:25;"A little context:

Since I was a young teenager, I often wondered why some people would cut themselves. I used to believe that people did it because it was a pain that they had a sense of control over. It just didn’t make sense to me though. Once cut, you can’t “choose” to feel or not feel the physical pain it causes, right?

Now, this may actually be the case for some people. I don’t know. I’m not here to make some generalization about people who cut themselves. Nor am I making some psychological claim backed up by scientific data. I’m here solely to share a new perspective I have for inflicting pain on oneself.

I have been dealing with clinical depression for a little while now. Despite a clear family history of mental illness, I spent a long time denying that such a thing could happen to me. It wasn’t until a failed attempt to commit suicide, and seeing the pain that it caused my family, to finally admit that I might need some help.

It’s been a few years now of therapy and medication, and although I’ve made progress, I still experience many setbacks...I’m going through an exceptionally difficult one right now.

I was sitting in my bedroom one day, frustrated as fuck with myself, and for some reason started punching my legs. I’m sure I must’ve looked like a child throwing a tantrum, but it seemed like the energy released, coupled with the physical pain, was enough to distract me from the disappointment and anger of not being good enough that was eating me up inside.

In retrospect, I feel bad about that moment, because my dog was in the room with me, and with every blow to my thighs, she would get scared and move farther away. I now know better and keep her outside my bedroom when hurting myself. 

So, punching seemed to help, but it wasn’t quite enough. I soon moved to whipping myself in the back, over the shoulder, with one of my leather belts. This proved much more effective. I was surprised the first time I tried this method of self-harm. The delayed, hot sting, immediately took me back to my childhood when my dad would hit me with a leather strap. It’s been so long since I’ve received that particular form of punishment, but I instantly recognized that sensation.

I have since been able to continue with this practice without being burdened by thoughts of the past. It’s all about helping me cope with the present. I never considered that inflicting pain on oneself could have nothing to do with control, but serve merely as a means of distraction. I actually look forward to coming home and whipping myself, and will get annoyed if someone or something keeps me from it. Sure, it hurts like hell, but I feel better emotionally afterwards.

Now, I’m sure this is not the healthiest type of behavior, and I should probably talk to my therapist about it, but I’m worried they’ll try to make me stop. I don’t plan on doing this forever...just until a get over this little slump I’m in.

Anyways...it feels good to talk about this without having to look someone in the eyes afterwards and promise never to do it again.";_sick_puppy_

The first 2 months were nothing but love and happiness. We would see each other 2-3 days a week due to distance but enjoyed every second of it. Then about 10 days ago her depression kicked in for the first time in our relationship.     



It started with her getting annoyed by my humor. She wasn't sure if I was annoying or if she was just irritable. She looked at her phone and said it was her since her period was coming up. Of course, I know just how annoying I can be so I turned my personality down like 3 notches for the week.     



Then things got suspiciously bad. She came over and for the first time ever she did not want to cuddle or talk at all. She fell asleep on the opposite side of the bed and clearly didn't want any physical contact. This was a complete 180 for her since she normally is freezing without me. I had to leave early in the morning for work before she woke up. I come back and learned she left to see a movie by herself 30 minutes before I got home from work. When she came back from the movie she stayed for half an hour then drove home.     



We had a talk about it and after some gentle prying she told me ""I couldn't stand the affection anymore, not one more night."" We talked some more and she went into detail about her depression, medication, and just about everything. From what I can tell the medication she is on is both the wrong medication for her and even the wrong dose. She agrees on the wrong medication aspect and was neglecting to switch it due to denial (until now). We haven't seen each other since the day she left but continue to talk every day, albeit less.       



Despite our progress, she still heavily dislikes a lot of my enthusiastic personality. I know you can't solve depression but I do want to solve some of the dynamics of our relationship. so below are the problems I want to address and I'm open to any advice.     

* How do I show support in a semi-long distance relationship (100 miles)?
* Is it normal to be annoyed by your SO when depressed?
* How do I reduce/recover my feelings of being emotionally drained?";GanksOP

(The first thing what I say is I am Russian, and my english can be absolutly awful.)

I'll start from far away, 1.5 years ago, I met the awesome girl (Next DF). She blew up my mind and I has become crazy. In the begining everything was fine, we was friends and etc. at one moment I suggested she be my girlfriend. She refused. But I was really crazy, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and I saw her every day, we are studing at the same university. I couldn't stop bother her and she got very angry. We didn't talk about 2-3 month, and all this i was in a great depression. 

After this time i found out that she found a boyfriend, It was my friend, with whom I discussed this problem a lot. Of corse it was not easy, but I resigned. I found a girl, everything was Ok

Finally, let's get down to my problem, last 2 month I have something like depression, every day i think that i choose the wrong university, i have problem with my health, i dont know about what talk with my present girlfrind, nothing fascinates me, any failure makes me angry and I just want to die and i think that everything in my life is going to shit. And the main reason of my depression, it is DF,  becouse all my life revolves around her. We are friends now, we have the same hobbies, read the same books, watching the same films. But now, I am thinking about her everyday again. I dont know what to do, I can not accept the fact that I can never be with her.

The depression and loneliness, however brief, is much worse than when I wasn't dating, and that was pretty bad.;TheWarTorn
936;Is it my fault?;0;bhnujl;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhnujl/is_it_my_fault/;1;2019-04-26 12:50:14;I recently ran into a plethora of relationship hardships with my boyfriend. (yeah, cliche I now). Everything had been great.. maybe. (sometimes I think I see things how I want, not how they are) Or maybe I was forcing it to be. We had a huge fight and he said some hurtful things and ever since then I don't see him the same. I look at him and I feel anger, not adoration like before. I've been getting angry easier and it makes me want to scream and try to get him to realize how he is making me feel. The heavy toll of the stress from trying to get some form of caring from him is weighing on me hard. I've been unable to speak for the most part, as if I actually can't find words or maybe I just gave up because I can't even think of a thing to say. When I can, it seems so unimportant I just keep it to myself. All I've been wanting to do is lay in bed and stare at the wall. Somehow, I don't even feel bored. I have been focusing on how I feel so much that I can't focus on anything else. I don't know if he doesn't know what is going on or simply doesn't care enough to get involved. He just sits on the couch and watches sports. He puts that above me. I could be right next to him crying and he won't say a word to me or show that he even notices. It is so true when people say they feel more alone being around someone than if they were by themselves. That's where I am at. I used to self-harm as a kid and prided myself in not doing it for years but every once in a while it is almost as if I can't help it. I don't know if I like the distraction or I am acting out for attention so he can see what is going on, hoping he will care. Maybe both. Does this make me a bad person? Am I over-exaggerating? I just can't stand being with someone and feeling as if they couldn't care less and acts selfish in a sense. I do nothing but put him first every time and everyday. If I get mad and tell him how I feel he gets mad right back. If I am quiet and don't say anything, he won't bring it up or try to help. It feels like a constant losing battle. I am scare if I tell him what really is on my mind, he will decide he can't handle me and leave. I recently have been day-dreaming of suicide. Not that I will do it or anything I am sure, but it seems like an attractive idea. I space out a lot. I'm dead tired, mostly emotionally. Some people stop feeling altogether and I wish for the same. I tell myself I don't care and I try not to but to no avail. So I guess I am wondering, is it my fault I feel like this? Am I justified in feeling this way? And if I am, am I just being dramatic? I suppose it is worth noting I had been somewhat recently diagnosed with BPD/Bipolar so maybe it is my fault. I don't want to ruin another relationship.. but again, is it me or him?;KerrBearStare95

938;When you just want to die;3;bhnttv;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhnttv/when_you_just_want_to_die/;5;2019-04-26 12:48:25;"So here’s my depression/anti-depressants story.

I’m 36F. Married, kids, career. I’ve been on anti-depressants most of my adult life.

I started taking anti-depressants in my early teens, post sexual assault, won’t go into details, but I decided to seek help when my neighbor committed suicide and my first thought was “hey, that’s a pretty good idea”. Yeah. Anyway, I weened off meds in my mid-20s for having kids/nursing for about 3 years. Got back on the meds when I started having “they’ll be better off without me” thoughts. The final straw was watching a Seinfeld re-run where he’s visiting his parents at their retirement community and I thought “This is not worth living for, gonna die eventually anyway, why not now?”. So, back on the meds.

Fast forward about 7 years. Somehow, I got into the whole “pharma is the devil, poison in your body” BS. Weened off meds. In a span of a year off anti-depressants, I managed to put on 75 lbs and turn from a happy, outgoing, normal person to someone who just wants to die every day. I still plowed through taking care of my family and work obligations but I had to force myself to get out of bed every morning and any given chance, I’d be mindlessly lying on the couch binge-watching Netflix. If kids were away at grandma’s and hubby out of town, I would spend the entire time on the couch. I stopped going out with friends. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to the store and would only go if something couldn’t be delivered. I stopped talking to people on the phone and would cringe when I had to make work calls. I work remotely so I did my best to do the absolute minimum just to keep my job. I turned from a highly organized neat freak into a pathetic lazy slob. Even taking a shower and shaving was a chore. And while part of me knew that I should do something about it, I just couldn’t bring myself to actually make an appointment until one day I got the gun out of the safe, walked into the bathroom, and thought that I should probably shoot myself in the shower so there’d be less cleanup after because hubby would have to sell the house after. But then I thought - kids will come home from school and will find me and I just could not do that to them. I got in a car, drove to the nearest psychiatrist and just walked in and said I have to see a doctor, any doctor, immediately, all the while bawling my eyes out at the thought of my kids walking on my scattered brains.

Long story short, a month later I am a different person. I’m almost my old me, except I still have 50 lbs to lose (lost 25 lbs in one month, no gym yet, just getting off the fucking couch did the trick). I’m the active and involved mom my kids used to have. I’m on top of my shit at work. My house is spotless. I go out and do stuff with my friends. I host parties. I enjoy reading books again and barely watch any TV. I feel like a normal person again.

Now, for the logical question - didn’t anyone notice I was spiraling out of control? Well, I’m very good at keeping up appearances and providing excuses. Weight gain? Yeah, it’s a thyroid problem. Can’t go volunteer at school or go to a dinner party? Sorry, busy at work. Can’t attend company get-together? Sorry, busy with family. Can’t go play with the kids? Sorry, too tired. Etc. My husband was going through job changes and traveled a lot during that time and was too stressed out to really pay attention.

I’m ok with the thought that I might be on anti-depressants forever. I talked to my doctor about possible alternative treatments in the future but I have to fully stabilize first.

Depression is real. It is not some made-up shit that you can just shake off. Feeling sad once in a while is ok, feeling sad to the point when you stop enjoying every single thing you used to love is not ok. If you see someone’s behavior change drastically, pay attention - they might be putting up a front that everything’s ok but they might need help. Pharmaceuticals might be the devil but I can tell you, they work.

tl;dr If you are depressed, seek help before it’s too late.";Average-Jane19

my Depression really started to hit in about a Year ago now. I always knew during my school days it was lingering around but i tried everything to keep it away and hide it to people around me. Every one around me just saw the Mask i was wearing when i was outside or socially interactive and no one suspected me to have any sort of problems. Last year i got in a relationship, and about 3 Months in, the Depression hit me like a truck, i couldn't go to work or meet with friends. I didn't know how my GF would handle all this so i told her everything about me and my Feelings since i first noticed it. i told her about the fact that i would love to just stop existing. She said she wasn't able to understand what i feel like but she'll support me. she convinced me to see a Therapist and helped me wherever she could. My GF had to sacrifice a lot of fun because of me. I thought i didn't deserve someone like her and then i started thinking about it. I hate myself. there are  few things i would say i like about me. i see myself as a burden especially right now where i'm not able to get my  ass moving  without help.  i don't want to be a burden for someone else. Well my Gf cheated on me so at least, i could break up with her and don't have to think about beeing a burden for her. 

It makes me want to scream internally. Now that I'm ""alone"" again i really want a Person in my life i can share anything with and just feel love. but at the same time i don't want to be burden to anyone. Even if she says its Ok i feel like i deprive her of her own life because she has to  handle someone like me. Even if her love is true i can't let it get to me because i hate my self so much.

> Christopher Winter M.D, sleep advisor for Men’s Health, has said that if you get up at the same time every day, your brain will begin to get used to a specific schedule.

> But, if you go back to sleep, your brain gets confused and doesn’t know what time it should tell your body to wake up, meaning your body doesn’t get the usual hormone boost and consequently you feel like shit.

Other sources talk about your body raising your temperature when it's time to wake up, and lowering it when it's time to sleep.

One of them claimed that a shitty sleep schedule can make your mornings groggy because you get a temperature boost along with hormonal, but at the wrong time, instead of when you actually wake up.

**What can depression do?**

*Wreak havoc with a regular sleep schedule.*

How does it feel when you wake up at the wrong time, without the temperature boost?

> ""It becomes kind of like jet lag… You wake up feeling kind of groggy, like you have a dull headache, maybe a bit of nausea, and lethargy—you just don’t feel like doing anything.""

*Like a crappy morning with depression.* If you're used to similar depressive symptoms, you'll probably just be like oh, here we go again.

I tried it out a few hours ago and took a superhot shower. Didn't help my mood, but definitely greased the wheels on getting ready for the day and not feeling like a sack of potatoes, so maybe that wasn't just ionization/conditioning. I'm going to try sitting in front of a space heater next time, and see if it helps too.

Even if it does nothing for you guys, it's not like it's risky advice, so this might be worth a shot if you haven't been sleeping well + mornings are a drag?

**Caveat:** if you live somewhere with extremely hot weather and every morning is already superheated, never mind. Might help to cool your room down at night, but you probably already are and that's more of a hassle. Oh well.";PM_ME_YER_SHIBA_INUS

I want to share with you my new way to deal with my mental disorders. Maybe it would help someone too!

But first: an introduction

I am living with chronic Depression since I was a child. I also have dependent personality disorder and self-harm disorder. I am currently 22 and was in a stationary therapy for 10 weeks and used many medications.
Nothing worked for me, the medication made me ill and therapy doesn't worked for me.

I am working with self-discipline for a long time and it works really fine for me. I push myself to do all the things I would like to do and focus on my mind to reduce stress.

My live is really great, but I am still not happy.
What I try now is a low-waist lifestyle.
It's not only because of the economic benefits.
I am giving the things I have around me more value. If I need to buy new stuff, I chose the eco alternative for example bamboo toothbrush, solid shampoo.
Tidying up my home and making it well organized helps me with it.
Giving my surrounding more value helps me a lot in living with depression and I didn't even know how I didn't came on that idea earlier.
Reducing plastic is like an inner and outer detox too. But most importantly: don't stress yourself by doing something good for you.
I am not living 100% low-waist, I am doing it, how I like it.


I hope I can help someone with my idea.";Rubescence

I'm typically an extremely extroverted person. I make friends easily and always have comedy or chat material for every person. I'm described as nice, kind and sensitive to people's feelings. It's always me who listens to other's problems and console them like a therapist. However, every night I lie in bed, feeling like the loneliest person in the world. No matter how many friends I have, or how many chat groups or chats I have online. I'm always the one consoling others and I have no one to open up my feelings to. I feel so disconnected from this amazing huge galaxy and world we have. I feel like I'm alone in this tiny country in this tiny planet surrounded by all these people. I feel like no one feels what I feel. Why am I here? The world is so big and I'm nothing but a speck that will die off, the world moves on, the galaxy, and time moves on. I see posts about child slaves and feel sad for the day, then I go back to happily commenting on a cute animal post. Everything, every feeling, every event passes on, and here I am. I'm in the center of it all, and yet so disconnected. Recently I played Red Dead Redemption 2 (Video games take me to a world where I'm the connector to the world, it makes me feel significant, loved, and surrounded), and the ending and storyline made me feel so much that I can't describe it. I often find myself crying at the death's, thoughts and personalities of the characters that I won't ever meet. I often find myself crying in bed at how I wish for a game life I can't have. I have everything: friends, grades, a good life, a loving family and opportunities all around me. Yet I just want to end it all, why? I'm so lost in the endless universe.;AldofieHitler

I am tired of trying so hard. Busted my ass so I could graduate from an expensive university, had to work full time while my mom helped with my rent and sometimes food expenses (I had to move to another city). I managed to graduate debt free but I am still tired.  
I don't have a great social life because my income does not allow me to have one and it only helps pay for my expenses (rent, food, internet and sometimes I can take my girlfriend for dinner once a month). The little money I can manage to save I always end up spending because something always comes up (health issues, apartment maintenance, car maintenance, etc).  
I don't have a great diet and my family from both sides are diabetic, have heart problems or both.  
I was unemployed for 4 months before my current job and managed to sustain myself because when my dad died, I inherited some money.  
I had a promising job with a good above average salary for but that was once on a lifetime kind of job and my boss died. Where I currenty work, they pay me half of what I did and I am working 70-80 hours a week.  
Right now I'm only working to survive, without anychance of any salarial raise and no other opportunity has appeared. I've been patient for 8 months and I'm fed up.  
When I get home I immedietly cook dinner, I take a bath, wash my working clothes and just sleep 4 to 5 hours just to wake up early to get to work.

(I don't live in the States, I live in Dominican Republic; it's the big island in the Caribbean.)

Monthly expenses

\- My rent: 200 dollars  
\- Food expenses: 80 dollars  
\- Gas expenses: 80 dollars (In my country a gallon of regular gas is 5 dollars)  
\- Internet, electricity and water: 60 dollars

TOTAL: 420 dollars

My salary  
\- Monthly salary: 450 dollars

Debt:  
\- Credit card: 100 dollars  
\- Rent: 50 (I owe this because I had to use some of the rent money to go to emergency)

In my country it's hard to climb because usually you have an opportunity only if you know important people or you have close family member who is a politician

I don't know what to do. I hate this life and I am thinking I should just end it. What's the point in working if I can't enjoy life? This is not life, I work to pay my bills, so I can get home to sleep so I can wake up early. Sometimes I manage to get 3 to 4 hours of free time a week.";UnitedBeae

I sleep 20 hours a day, I stopped going to classes, I stopped eating completely. When I’m awake, I just lay on my bed and cry. I haven’t been out of the house in weeks except for yesterday. I went to the movies to try to get some fresh air and watch something I would enjoy, and I couldn’t even do that. I would check my phone every 20 mins just to see how much longer for the movie to end so I could go home and lay in bed. I feel like my life has no purpose. I’m not afraid of death, I’m afraid of what comes before it. I would be in a better place if I would just do it. Suffering like this for years is not something I want to be a part of. I’m on meds, I do therapy, nothing helps. And who would want to be with someone like me? Someone who’s so fucked up in the head and sad all the time? No one. No one wants that.

To make matters worse recently, because everyone already knows, I've been sharing my thoughts on people and whether their depressed or faking it (which is an opinion I'm entitled to have because as many of you guys reading this know, depression drowns you and for people to fake it, is petty and I think they don't deserve the attention they crave, regardless of what they're doing to themselves) and recently one of my closet friends has decided to share to people that she thinks say I'm not depressed and that I cant say others aren't, even though shes never been depressed.

Sometimes it gets so bad, I lose all control and actually start carrying out my suicide plans. Does this happen to other people or is this just me????

&#x200B;

More:

I've been diagnosed with atypical depression and schizoid personality disorder after being warded for a suicide attempt and now on Prozac. Used to obssess about suicide literally all the time but ever since I got meds, it's become maybe an hourly, or on good days, once a day occurrence. All in all, except for a few stupid side effects (drowsiness, a ridiculously big appetite), things have gotten alot better. It has been a while since I felt like I was on the brink of actually committing suicide. I've been feeling really horny lately (weird because apparently Prozac is supposed to kill your sex drive) and whenever that happens, I masturbate. However, after orgasm, my mood ALWAYS plummets and I end up feeling seriously suicidal. This is the only time I feel like I seriously want to commit suicide (right there right now) and sometimes I even start carrying out my plans. Usually when that happens, I force myself to sleep (I only masturbate at night) and when I wake up the next morning I feel fine again. This has nothing to do with guilt about sinning or whatever because I'm not religious and come from a pretty sex positive family. I think it has something to do with feeling intensely lonely. But the thing is, I'm a loner most of the time (by choice) and most of the time, I feel great about it. Just after masturbating is about only time I genuinely feel lonely. I'm not a bad looking person and plenty of decent people have expressed interest in hooking up or getting into a relationship with me. But the thing is, I can't bring myself to have sex with someone else. Not because I'm incapable of sexual attraction but because in every sexual situation I've been in, I genuinely felt like they are invading my personal space. The problem now is that now I know that masturbation triggers the return of my suicidal thoughts but I am unable to satisfy my sexual urges in any other way. Having to choose between being sexually frustrated and suicidal is really shitty. 

&#x200B;

So:

\- does this happen to other people?

\- is there a scientific explanation for this happening?

\- how do I stop it?

977;Trying to be a good friend while dealing with my own depression is too difficult on most days and can easily lead to resentment;1;bhm061;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhm061/trying_to_be_a_good_friend_while_dealing_with_my/;3;2019-04-26 10:01:40;"My friend has self-esteem issues and needs constant reassurance. Seems she might never get better and I find myself controlling my own emotions so I don't get resentful. I can't fix her and neither can she fix me but I would appreciate her putting some more effort into taking care of herself.  

But at the end of the day I am limited to trying to be a good friend which entails being there for her, praising her when she does something good, encouraging her to get out and doing things that are healthy and active, doing other activities together every now and then instead of drowning in our sorrows at the bar, etc.

I think what sucks most is that she doesn't quite understand the depth of my depression and then continues to vent and complain about her situation and how it's impossible to fix the problems in her life. We've had a serious talk at one point about how it's hurting me when she does this constantly. So she's held back from doing it every now and then, but then she will ask me permission to vent and complain. At that point, I feel like the bad guy if I say no. 

Relationships are complicated, man. You want to be there for the other person but then they drive you insane. Which leads to resentment. And then leads to apathy. And then you wonder why you even try. Which leads to reinforcing your own mind with positive memories together. And then you have a talk with them. But then the same problems surface again later on.

Anxiety meds are shit and I don’t want Xanax because of obvious reasons, I’m lethargic unless I take a very strong amphetamine weight loss pill. I’m fighting to see my children and losing. The only time I could resist the urge to get fucked up was when I was with them. And now their mother won’t even answer me. 

Seroquel is fucking with my head and my nightmares are disgusting. I can’t sleep without it, but I wake up from at least three nightmares a night. I’m drowning. Does anyone have any advice. Im in a drug and alcohol program and I’m getting help with my meds but nothing is helping and this place is fucking expensive and the bills are just racking up.. okay. Rant over.

But I am always the last choice when it comes to something that they want to do with somebody. They never give a shit about me. They dont write unless I write to them. They dont call me or ask me how I feel. But they still call themselves ''close friends'' with me. I always had that feeling but its kinda the breaking point nowadays. Why dont they just tell me that they dont want me around them? Is it really that hard? Why would you hurt somebody's feelings by giving them false attention/love if you dont want that particular person around you or just downright hate him/her? What am I supposed to do? How can I tell them to be honest with me about their feelings? Cause I really rather be friendless than having fake friends.;SirOrange01

993;Cannot help but to blame my personality;1;bhl7xz;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bhl7xz/cannot_help_but_to_blame_my_personality/;0;2019-04-26 08:27:06;"Here lies the root of all my problems: **lack of like-ability**, whatever that is. I wish I was born with a different facial makeup or different proportions of the body. The combination of my look and tiredness built up over the past years is now soaking my life with misery.

People think I am normal, but I am very abnormal: I just cannot develop a meaningful relationship.

Only with shrewd moves to develop a friendship, I managed to get inside two groups for the past 29 years. 

My complete lack of athletic ability exacerbated the problem. In the state where I grew up, it was common for kids to play ball and develop some kind of friendship. I could never make the cut for any team. I had virtually no close group of friends in my early teenage years, and that developed myself into a loner. I developed relationships with a few persons, but I just could not maintain the relationship, primarily because no one wants to see the same person 24/7.

This problem--typically faced by people when people grow up and overcome sometime in their life--never was solved in my life. In fact, it exacerbated and became very much a real world problem in college.

I could not develop a close network of friends nor could I develop a mentor who could guide my career. The first difficulty was that I could not get any information on which courses to take or which study aids to use. I took courses no freshmen should be allowed to take and destroyed my first semester grades.  Career counsels should be damned because when I went there for some mentorship, they were very talented in discouraging me from choosing practical majors--even though that was what I really should have studied. To retrospect, they had some kind of a secret mission to discourage students from choosing business majors and preserve the liberal art integrity of the school. They chose me as the scapegoat. Had I at least chosen a practical major, I would have landed a better job and use that job as a leverage to develop a relationship. But that didn't happen. 

Despite these obstacles, I tried. I got interview opportunities during my junior and senior year. But I could not impress the interviewers. Rather, I was always paralyzed when they tried to press me into the corner to see how I react. And it also didn't help that I was taking depression medication from the long period of isolation and loneliness and depression made me lose my brain power. 

After moving into my parents' house for nearly one year after graduation and spending time there, I managed to land a job. But it also didn't go well. I couldn't stop but to compare myself with all other people who were so confident in themselves and their looks. I became more and more insecure everyday. Probably the company I worked for hired me because my academic credentials were okay, but I ended up disappointing others in the company because my productivity was continuously compromised by insecurity. Grades ,credentials, and momentary sparks seemed to indicate I should perform okay, but with insecurity over my personality and my looks, I just could not concentrate well on my work or self-development. 

I took another job but was laid off there. One of my supervisors told me my work was okay, but my problem was that I seemed incapable of devoting myself to the gig, maybe due to the lost opportunity of studying business-which I was actually more interested in--or going to going to graduate school.

Now I am at the point of life crisis again. Maybe I should have dated more and played more in college to build up my confidence, but I didn't have such opportunity, and now those with such confidence are easily surpassing me--because they are doing what they want to do and not get compromised by insecurity or depressin medication.";theproblemofpain
