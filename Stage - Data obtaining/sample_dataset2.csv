Women just don't interest me. I wish with all my soul that I could have a brain that's wired normally. I know that I can never act on what I feel, but I need to speak to a therapist because I don't think I can get through this on my own. But if I talk to a therapist he could report me, because I have to talk about my attraction to young girls. I don’t know whether he would or not and don't even know how to go about getting more information. Even the friendships I have are in danger of falling apart because I can't just keep saying 'I'm fine' and I can't talk to anyone about my problem. I think about suicide a lot.;throwaway731146

4;Self-Sabotaging...?;2;bj3bkg;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj3bkg/selfsabotaging/;0;2019-04-30 10:29:29;"Hey there. 24/Female

I’ve struggled with depression and severe anxiety for 13 years now. 
Always had a bit of trouble keeping it together, but recently I’ve been self-sabotaging, and it feels like nothing can stop it. 

For example, I’m supposed to work today. I was also supposed to work yesterday. 

But I called in both yesterday and today, saying I was “sick”. That’s not the case. I just feel like I can’t get out of bed. I feel like everything is falling apart- and it’s definitely not. I have an amazing, supportive boyfriend. I have a house. A wonderful dog. My job is one of the easiest and most fun jobs I’ve ever worked. 

It’s now impacting me financially, and I’m pretty sure at this point I’m going to get fired tomorrow because of the amount of time I’ve been taking off recently. 

I’ve been too afraid to tell anyone the real reason I haven’t been going to work, because I don’t feel like they’ll be understanding. Hell, I’m not even understanding towards myself. I’m incredibly angry at myself for not being able to just suck it up and go to work. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Even if not, what do you think I should do? 
( I can’t currently afford to see a doctor, or get medication. )

Thanks for reading.";Lixxxi

I don't want to be playing a victim or whatever, I think there can be a lot of overpathologising in this sub, but I think there's a pretty decent chance I'm some sort of BI polar or schizophrenic or something. I have crazy crazy mood swings ALL the time, I cry at least once a day, have my entire life and I've been self harming for a long time.

My jobscope is pretty relaxed as I'm a part timer for a few months. But, it's so gruelling to just sit there for 9 odd hours, waiting for stuff to come in and be done. Basically there can be times I do absolutely nothing and I'll feel a sense of guilt like I'm useless.

Colleagues are ok tho I feel that I'm awkward with them. It's not their fault of anything, I'm just probably paranoid and oversensitive that's why I have this feeling that they all don't like/annoyed with me

I also have no friends in my workplace, there's nothing I look forward to, I dread it. Yes it's only a few months but each day feels like a battle

I am an extreme introvert I can barely keep eye contact, it's quite difficult for me to even make casual friends there.

9;Social anxiety has very likely destroyed my life.;4;bj358r;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj358r/social_anxiety_has_very_likely_destroyed_my_life/;2;2019-04-30 10:12:54;"I'm a 19 year old high school senior with absolutely 0 friends in school and I will be kicked out of the school at the end of this trimester.

For those wondering, I go to an alternative high school, which is a place made specifically to help high school students who were having trouble with regular school and needed smaller and more teacher-student focused courses. It doesn't have semesters like a normal high school, but the school year is divided up into trimesters so kids can get more credits quickly.

I was never a fan of this school. The entire reason I was sent there in the first place was because I didn't have glasses in freshman year and couldn't see the board so I had difficulty learning as everything past a foot in front of my face gets unreadably blurry. I told the teachers this and I guess they decided the best course of action would be to just send me off to the alternative school instead of actually trying to help me.

I cannot understate just how much I loved the normal high school. Up until freshman year, I was always the kid who people in class would throw trash at, or call gay and retarded because thats was what was funny back then, or just simply beaten up after lunch in the field outside. Needless too say, this scarred me for the rest of my life, and to this day I lay in bed some nights wondering how people can be so cruel to someone else just for the sake of laughter.

This all changed in freshman year and people treated me with respect and I had many close friends whom I would talk to daily and I felt like a real person. The summer after 8th grade I was preparing myself for even more beatings and even more name calling, but that never came. I was living in a state of bliss that I had not experienced before where I felt like a valued human being. I signed up for electives that sounded cool like AutoCAD, where you learn to model things in 3D, and I signed up for and stayed after school in my first extracurricular activity, Astronomy Club. I was friends with everyone, and I felt happiness I hadn't felt in a decade.

Of course, this all came to an end. I was struggling to keep good grades on the fact that I really couldn't see anything as I was practically blind and I was honestly living in a state of pure bliss, where I wanted to savour my newfound popularity. As a result of my failing grades, they sent me to the alternative school.

This was a completely different environment. I came from a school of order and friendliness to a place of violence and quite literal bloodshed. I have my conspiracies as to why exactly this school exists, and they all revolve around the thought that all the surrounding schools needed a place to dump their ""problem children"" to make themselves and their test scores look better, but that's just my conspiracy.

Either way, this school was nothing but chaos and disorder. Teachers cursing at the students, students throwing chairs and fighting each other in the classrooms, multiple school shooting threats that the school did nothing about, this place was my new hell. I had nothing in common with the people here and this new environment sent me into a very deep depression and gave me severe social anxiety. I locked myself away emotionally and as much as I could physically as both a coping and defensive mechanism because I was absolutely horrified at the thought of reliving the terror that was my middle school experience. I sat alone at lunch. I kept my head down almost all 8 hours of the day so that people wouldn't notice me and if they did try to talk to me I usually didn't respond. I became a total social outcast and I still am to this day.

I am not exaggerating when I say I didn't speak to anyone for almost 9 months. For some reason this place shook me to my core, and I began getting hostile with everyone, including my family as a means of trying to let out a little bit of the anger at my old school for ripping all of my friends and the best part of my life out of my hands. I stopped talking to absolutely everyone.

This went on for about a year, when I finally made friends with someone else in my situation, and we quickly became best friends, but this as well had to come to an end, as they graduated soon after. My grades slipped even more than they were at the regular high school, as I was both angry and depressed at everything in life that took me to this point, and I don't think I've had a single trimester where I had more than 2 passing classes. My will to work towards graduating as crushed.

This is where I am now. It has been an endless limbo of failing everything and hiding from everyone for the past 4-5 years, and its finally coming to an end. The school counselor threatened me with being kicked out if I didn't pass this trimester's classes, and I don't know whether I should feel even more depressed or elated at the fact that I will finally be free of my personal hell.

As a closing and more personal note, if anyone goes to the CVHS 9th grade center, I ask that you somehow please get the counselor to read this. I want them to see what they do to people they send here. Thank you for reading.";JellySugardust

I remember being colossally emotional, deeply empathetic and completely consumed by how I would feel. 

These days, however, I barely feel a thing. I lost my partner of 8 years following a small argument and barely shrugged. I go to work, and fail, and I am not phased. I don't know how I haven't been fired. 

I genuinely think that I am unable to feel anything anymore. I float through life unaffected. Major events have been occuring in my life, and I don't care. Even when my behaviour hurts other people. 

The only thing that I can *feel* is the insatiable urge to give up. I am not alluding to suicide, though that feels like an eventuality. I just want to let go of everything, and let it all fall where it may. 

I did well in school and I have managed to stumble through a couple of degrees and into a decent job. Yet, all my body wants to to is to go back to the menial, simple job that I held through my studies. I just feel that everybody had such high hopes for me that I would be letting those around me down. 

I have no motivation, no interests, no desire to really pursue anything. The closest thing I can achieve that is even comparable to happiness is given through substances and partying with friends.

lonely is the glue that holds together a body of an 90 year old and a mind of a 23 year old who is still convinced he is at a war

I thought lonely was every tut in a super market line because a conversation every Friday afternoon is the only sound of solitude the woman who can barely make it out some days will hear that week

I thought lonely was the break of the fever of a nightmare that happens every night, its significance embedded into the beads of sweat you're forehead holds onto 

I thought lonely was the echo of house parties, dance parties and every social event they said they were not going to, but simply did not want to invite you 

I thought lonely was in the cat's cry whose owners left it behind, and the only thing between its confusion and cold was misunderstanding. 

I thought lonely was the way hands move that you know you do not want to touch you, so much so that you have to question if the term 'no' was created in isolation 

Every-time I think I know what lonely is, it reinvents itself, silence being the catalyst, double glazed windows to the heart

Houses so silent, you can almost hear the dust collapsing onto picture frames holding memories that once was 

Lonely is the reality that the space between you and anyone else is a causeway, and that when the tide gets high, the only thing to do is to retreat to your island 

Lonely is the way I loiter at work for an extra 15 minutes at times, because sometimes hearing remarks about the weather 20 times is a way better melody than anything the darkness of your room could produce 

Lonely is the action of plugging a charger into a dying phone I know no one is going to call but doing so anyway because there is just a tiny bit of hope somebody might remember me 

Lonely is the realisation that you have all these things you want to say, and looking around you and realising there is no audience

Its a loop of a cry that gets lost in the daytime, the knight in armour of a conversation, but realising simply, there is no one.";LowCommunication2

I just came back after spring break and I’m already having people randomly try and bully me and start drama with me, even though I am a very reclusive and quiet person. Yesterday I was cooking myself pasta in the kitchen because I have no one to go to the cafeteria with. I asked a girl if I could use the salt and pepper to season my pasta, and she said “yeah, sure”. I took it and was using the pepper when this really bitchy girl came and said: “Um can you like stop using that? It’s -insert bitchy girl’s name-‘s pepper”. I had no idea and thought it was that other girl’s. The bitchy girl then proceeded to yell in the kitchen: “This bitch was fucking using your pepper! Like what’s wrong with this girl, go buy your own goddamn stuff like you really had the nerve to do that” and the bitchy girl was like: “I don’t really care” anyway. People started laughing and I had to just run and leave. Luckily my pasta was done. Also, there’s “communal salt and pepper”, so I just assumed it was that since it was out. 

Today I had to go to chapel in the morning and I went with this girl from my biology class (only girl who allows me to tag along with her) and we were behind these girls who are friends with my ex friends. They stopped and wouldn’t go in. They said the choir was practicing. I said: “I still think we can go in” (we could) and these two fake girls, one of whom who has verbally attacked me before, said: “Ok, how about you go in yourself?” But in a really, really bitchy way. The other girl said: “Yeah, just go and sit down by yourself”. I said: “On second thoughts, no. I don’t want to be alone”. Then the first bitchy girl said: “But I see you alone all the time so you must be used to it” in an even worse way. No one spoke up for me of course and everyone was just listening. Once I defended myself against this girl and I was called “rude”.. FOR DEFENDING MYSELF. This girl is incredibly manipulative, and fake cried when I defended myself, even though in that situation she told me to get the hell out of the event and that no one wanted me there.

I am a recluse. I stay in my room most of the time. I study and go to the library by myself most of the time.. Yet I’m still getting drama. I’m getting attacked more than the majority of people. I also am getting deliberately excluded (people are blanking me) because this girl spread false things about me. 

I don’t know what to do. I hate any attention on me. I have mini panic attacks when stuff like what happened in the kitchen happened. I can’t even defend myself against being bullied because then everyone turns against me for some reason.. I don’t know what to do.";pessimisticloser

For the past three months I have been wanting to kill myself every day. I can't find a job and I feel like a failure. I know if I work an office job I'll want to kill myself even more. I am so sad I stopped looking for jobs and taking care of myself because I just don't care. I haven't showered in 3 days and I stopped eating except the bare minimum. The thought of being out of college working a 9-5 miserable job and trying to pay off my debt gives me crippling fear. I want to be a teacher but I'm in the US and we treat our teachers like shit. From the outside I should be happy but I just can't muster up the energy to try anymore.;motherofdogandcat
25;25th Birthday is Today;2;bj2psx;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj2psx/25th_birthday_is_today/;5;2019-04-30 09:28:50;"My 25th is today and I’m in a shit mood. I’ve been struggling with the major depression I’ve had for 5years (along with anxiety and PTSD) and it’s not been getting better. I overdid it yesterday and feel horrible today, mainly mentally but also physically. I cut off all dead-end friendships and relationships and deleted all social media so I’m pretty much spending this “milestone” birthday alone until my boyfriend gets off of work.

I’ve been on countless combinations and dosages of medications, tried at least 5 therapists, been in outpatient group therapy at least three times and been hospitalized at least once. I know so many coping skills and techniques but a lot of them either don’t work well for me or dont work at all. More often than not, I’m extremely irritated, frustrated, angry and tearful (upset) because I truly don’t think it will get better.

I’ve gone through the stages of positivity and being hopeful for the future but what if I do that for the rest of my life, and on my death bed, I look back and realize I wasted all that time hoping and things never really got better? It’s not even that I’m not grateful for what I do have—a roof over my head, a truly loving and caring boyfriend, a support and loving mother, food, clothes, a car to drive, a job, etc. I am very grateful but my head is just so fucked up that I still believe I’d be better off dead or just not “here.” 

I can be so positive and encouraging for others but the exact opposite for myself.

I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of any of this. Just wanted to vent. I hope someone can relate and maybe prove that things have gotten better for them. I just don’t know how much longer I can live like this.";WtchyBlkLdy
26;Problems with my dad 😞;3;bj2or5;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj2or5/problems_with_my_dad/;0;2019-04-30 09:25:29;"TW:mentions of verbal and emotional abuse, mentions of suicide and self harm

Have you ever had problems with your parents? Were they often resolved? Do they ever look back and learn from their past mistakes and learn from? I can’t say my dad is perfect but, this is whom I’ll be talking about. I have a strained relationship with him and it’s been that way since my younger years. He isn’t all that bad as he does have a sense of humor and he is a hard worker and all but, this doesn’t justify what I’m about to discuss.

When I was little, he always treated me nicely. Never mean to me. Never violent towards me. If I misbehaved, he did what any parent would do and that’s discipline me. He did use spanking but, he never went too far with it. Anyways, my childhood was bittersweet. Sure, I got toys and video games and anything I needed but, things weren’t perfect all the time. Often times, my mom and dad had arguments and I hated it as the arguments me cry.

They had marital problems as my dad can be such an asshole. They separated when I was ten and my brother had turned five afterwards. I was heartbroken as I had no hatred towards him back then but, due to a family member of my mom’s, I was conditioned into being scared of him as she falsely accused him of raping me. My mom went through hell with my dad and her sister. Eventually, she and my dad started talking again and they got back together. 

Things seemed fine but as I got older, I often saw my dad as a mean guy whenever he yelled. I don’t like being yelled at in general. It’s once of my stressors as I go through depression and I’m the sensitive type. Sure, I often acted like a spoiled brat and a bitch but, I was and still am a human. When I was thirteen, I felt he was too harsh with me and I acted so defiant and at times, told my dad I hated him. My relationship with him was strained as I had behavioral problems in school as well in seventh grade. I was troubled.

I sometimes felt my dad hated me even though he doesn’t beat me, call me names, etc. In the past at age eleven, I attempted suicide by cutting my face and often times, I wanted to hurt myself cause I went through bullying in school and whenever I smacked my face, my dad would berate me for it and demonize me. This made me want to hurt myself even more than ever. For so long, I dealt with shit from my dad and managed to keep it a secret from my classmates at school. 

My dad isn’t all that bad. He works and provides food and the things we need. He often has his days and I do too. However, it isn’t what he says to me. It’s how he says it and how he portrays himself. One time, I smacked my face and he grabbed my hand and he said that self harm would make people think differently of me and that of course, made me want to hit myself even more. It didn’t help that I was already having suicidal thoughts during that time due to bullshit I was going through in secret.

It wasn’t until late January that things escalated. I was hungry and getting dressed for work and I was in a rush to get ready for my shift in the morning from ten am to two in the afternoon. I was heating up food but, heated up two items on my plate the wrong way. My dad was just coming home from my younger brother’s doctor appointment and had to do some shopping and he did look inside and he started yelling. He cursed me out and I started crying. 

My mom was telling him to stop and he just went on and on. I cried to the post where I wasn’t able to calm down so I simply called in sick and didn’t say anything else. My dad just berated me and he apologized but they were half assed and not genuine. I got back home to get out of my work clothes given that I wasn’t working then. At that point, I couldn’t fucking take it anymore. I had wrapped an extension cord around my neck but, I stopped out of fear someone was going to catch me. 

I laid in bed for the remainder of the day until my dad went to work. I ate and then days later, I started hurting myself by biting my arms. I left a few bruises on my left arm and on my right, I left a slight one. For days on end, I was in pain. On January 27th, the pain was so unbearable to the point where I started to lose my shit at work and I opened up to my boss that I was hurting myself and thinking of doing it more. I even opened up a little about my dad.

That was when two kind officers came to my home that afternoon. My boss had told them what had been going on with me. I even cried and I had so much anxiety as I also have Aspergers syndrome. I was taken to a behavioral healthcare facility by police car with my dad in the back seat with me. I was admitted and I started to see my dad cry and I could tell he was showing remorse.

I stayed there for almost a week. I was diagnosed with depression and take antibiotics and go to counseling. For the time being after returning home, things seemed fine. My dad knew not to fuck with me. I am very angry with my dad as he is what pushed me towards suicide. My best friend was lonely and my boyfriend didn’t even know what was going on at the time. I started to curse more often and of course, my dad also gives my mom shit too. 

There’s only so much I can share about my life even on the internet. The only thing I miss about being a kid was when my dad wasn’t berating me at all. I often get envious of those whom have a good relationship with their dad. I used to see myself as daddy’s little girl but, I don’t anymore. I’m more of a mama’s girl to be completely honest. I just hate that my dad hurts my feelings and pisses off my mom. Sometimes, I feel my dad is trying to turn my against her but, I don’t wish to go into too much detail about that bit.

I can never share my troubles with him at all. The reason I clam up is often times, he makes me feel like every single fucking thing is my damn fault. I open up to my mom but, only partially. Same with my best friend. My boyfriend though is a different story as I can open up to him without fear of being blamed. I just wish a random guy would claim me as his daughter but, that can’t happen legally cause as of Sunday, April 28th, I’m twenty one years old. I’m getting older and I can’t stop that. 

My birthday was nearly ruined because of my dad acting like such a douchebag towards my mom. I felt so hostile and angry. I felt a heaviness before going on a walk with my mom. Now, for the big question, why do I keep silent and not report him given that it drove me towards suicide and self harm? Like I said, I just turned twenty one and CPS can’t do anything to me. If I dare tell my counselors, they’ll suggest for me to move out and find my own place but, I can’t afford to move out unfortunately. If I were a fairy godmother, I’d make that happen and move in with my boyfriend and best friend  but, it’s a long distance relationship and fairy godmothers only exist in Cinderella. Plus, my best friend is fixing to be sixteen and of course, my friendship with her is also long distance. 

I am hopeless about my future. Do I want a relationship and a family someday? I do even though I have a fierce temper, overreact to shit, trust issues given my past, and of course, my over-tendency to overthink things and wanting to be alone all the time. Given how I saw shit go down between my mom and dad, I often find myself afraid of tying the knot but, deep down in the bottom of my withered heart, I do want to marry my boyfriend and be his wife and the mother of his children. 

He doesn’t treat me horribly the way my dad does. I do fear I may not be a good mommy if I were to have babies in the future whether they be adopted or biological as I am afraid of damaging them the way my dad did to me. As I conclude this post as I have been restless, I’m crying as I open up about the man who’s supposed to be my father as I kept it in for so fucking long. 

Please, do not send hate towards my dad or my mom. This is to vent about the pain I have been through and my mental health. Please keep any and all negativity to yourself. ❤️";Chao_Princess

I know its gonna affect me hard later on being that I can go through entire bottles in a day or two with beer being included daily. I've thought about killing myself alot.

I was returning from seeing my girlfriend and shes been what's keeping me together but its hard because shes so far away. I don't feel like I have her support sometimes and it just adds to my problem in my eyes. I know I have nothing to worry about with her but I just can't help the constant feeling of me failing her in some sort of way. I'm just tired of all of this.

33;after two years of progress I completely screwed up;3;bj2h14;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj2h14/after_two_years_of_progress_i_completely_screwed/;3;2019-04-30 09:02:03;"You can get more of the details about how I messed up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/biuqe6/my_sisterinlaw_kissed_this_weekend_and_she_doesnt/) in /r/relationship_advice. The TL;DR version is that my sister-in-law kissed this past weekend. It was an awful, awful thing that I did and it's starting me on a path I know too well. I'm M36, my wife is F34, and my sister-in-law is F27 if any of that matters.

&#x200B;

We were both drunk and it just happened. It was kind of a culmination of the crush that I've had on her but this is the first and hopefully last time that any actions were part of it. I don't need to be told how awful of a person and husband I am. I know. I'm spiraling because of it and it's taking me out of two years of clawing my way out of my desire to die right back into that hole. Two years of feeling like a burden on everyone and now I come along and start the whole thing over again.

&#x200B;

What also hurts is that she says she doesn't remember so I'm carrying this burden alone. Maybe I deserve to carry it by myself. I probably do. But I also have so much guilt that I should come clean with my wife but I won't allow myself to do that without letting my sister-in-law know but that would mean filling in the gaps from that night for her. And if she does actually remember but is just burying it, it hurts even more that she can just lock it away and move on and I can't, at least that the way it seems.

&#x200B;

I'm hurting so much. I haven't slept in two nights and I feel the familiar downward movement. My wife is actually going to be visiting her sister this weekend. That's going to be awkward for me enough as it is but I've also thought that maybe, just maybe, that is the perfect time to finally check out. I deserve it.";unfilterednow

I'm 27 living in Sydney. A few years ago I lost almost all of my friends, my girlfriend of four years left me, I lost my job and I had to move state to move back home with mum and dad. I've had a really hard time getting back on my feet. I'm not particularly incapable of doing so, I'm in shape, play sports, I'm almost finished with a computer science degree and people seem to like me when they meet me. However, my suicidal impulses are coming almost involuntarily and I'm even dreaming about it.

After everything happened I've become so withdrawn almost like I'm afraid of people. I have no desire to socialize and the city is quite intimidating for me since I grew up in a quiet beach town. I've been having a lot of panic attacks that keep putting me in the ER. I also consistently have disturbing dreams every night. I have a small history with drugs, specifically LSD and DMT when I used to play guitar in bands around the age of 19-22 that messed me up a little bit. Ive also become deeply entangled into alcoholism from the past year to cope with the depression.

I want to make friends, go on dates, and pursue creative projects again but it feels so impossible. Any drive or motivation I get to pull myself out of this hole is fleeting. It's only getting worse and I fear my life is over. I'm stuck in a cycle of self sabotage and it's starting to produce physical symptoms which is jeoprodizing my health. I feel like I'm running out of time to turn things around and I'll become such an unloved, unlikeable, unemployable mess that I'm better of dead.

I already tried to poison myself by overdosing on pain pills recently but I ended up making myself exceptionally sick. I'm at a point where I'm barely getting up in the mornings. The wave of memories that come flooding into my mind every time I wake up is the worst part of it. I feel so tired and so drained all the time.

I know there's people out there who have come back from much worse and I want to know what they did to get out of this mindset. If anyone out there has been where I am or is dealing with it positively please let me know. Any support is appreciated.";bigbadarchmage

&#x200B;

My mom is 56 and is just completely miserable and lonely. I started really noticing it in January when we went on vacation and one day she just had a mental breakdown about it and started crying about how miserable and lonely she was and everything. We went to Disney, a place we used to go all the time and she told me how she hates looking at everyone happy with husbands and families and shes completely alone.

&#x200B;

A little backstory:

My parents were married for 9 years (since she was 20), had me, dad cheated on her with my now stepmom and they have been divorced ever since. Up until I was in college, she never really dated. She had two relatively serious relationships with the last one ending almost 1.5 years ago now suddenly and right before the holidays. My mom has lived as a single mom almost since I was born and has a wicked successful career, had our home built, let me do and try everything and put me through college. She's my mom and I love her, but like any kid eventually, you move out (I'm her only child). This was about 2.5 years ago. 

Since then, I have seen her either every week or every other week. Whether it be shopping, dinner, movie, etc. But I'm not enough. She has had basically no friends since I went to college as she was really only ever friends with my friends' moms and only has her two brothers.  Now, I have tried to send her MeetUp links or encourage her to go out and make friends, but she is either not interested or is just too afraid sometimes. Dating has been completely nonexistent. My mom is a bit snobby when it comes to dating. I don't believe anyone should ""settle"" however, she sets her standards so high I constantly fear she will never find someone until she is a little more realistic about the potential dating pool.

To top it off, this last year has been a real nightmare, she has two dogs at home that I grew up with and her ""favorite"" was diagnosed with congenital heart failure. He has gone into heart failure three times and is now on prescription food, medication for the rest of his life and honestly, we don't know when his next episode will be and when he will simply pass away. Benny has been my moms' loyal companion since the day we got him, he is 13, so he has lived a long and good life for a dog, but my mom can't stand the thought of losing him. Stella, our other dog is 16 and my mom can't seem to cope with how Stella, excluding some age things like hearing and vision, is completely healthy. Also, because of Benny's condition, even if my mom wanted a social life she couldn't get one. Benny needs medication twice daily and requires a lot of care. Lastly, this year ended with my grandmother (her mother) passing away in December/ While they always had a strained relationship, it was still her mother and it's hard for anyone. 

Just this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I took her out to a really nice dinner and to see a musical with great seats. Now, I never want to throw the cost of stuff in anyone's face, but I spent close to $800 between dinner and the show and the entire time I felt she was miserable and had no interest in being there. It's just money, so I really don't care, but I was honestly heartbroken that I tried to make a really nice night out for my mom and she didn't even seem to care or even be happy. 

At this point, I just don't know what to do. She's never been like this, she's always been happy and fun to be around, but honestly, I can't stand being around her sometimes right now because she is so miserable. I feel like a horrible daughter, but in my mind, I can't help someone who won't help themselves. I have tried suggesting dating sites, MeetUps and other various stuff and she says ""she'll look."" Which really just means ""thanks, no thanks.""

I don't know what to do. I don't want my mom to be miserable. I want her to be happy, but I can't help feeling she is just doing this to herself because she won't even try. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - My mom is miserable and alone. I feel awful for her and I don't know what to do.";ladyonlexington
40;Are these normal effects of Zoloft (sertraline)?;2;bj2901;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj2901/are_these_normal_effects_of_zoloft_sertraline/;0;2019-04-30 08:36:39;"I recently had two surgeries in the past couple of months. Both were planned and minor outpatient procedures. I started Zoloft a few weeks before this all went down, so it took time before I started to feel the more lasting effects. Those first couple of weeks were riddled with constipation, lowered sex drive, and nothing else really. Nowadays I've been taking it with propranolol, which I use for anxiety. Propranolol usually hits about 45 minutes to an hour after I take it, lasting for maybe a handful of hours before calling it a day. (I take a very small dosage.)

Zoloft, on the other hand, has been a weird beast. My sex drive is still low, albeit not entirely nonexistent. I'm thinking far darker, big picture thoughts revolving around feelings of hopelessness and melancholy, which I never had experienced before. The usual panic and emotions that come from thoughts like those, *gone*. It's like the ideas are stronger than ever, but the physical symptoms are nowhere to be found.

Is this normal? I'm not sure if it's in part my recovery from my recent surgeries, or also this medication that has left me in a slump on the couch. I'm unmotivated. I care less about everything. I'm hopeless. But on the flip side, I'm not anxious or panicking. The exhausting, physical responses aren't happening anymore. I'm trying to weigh my options and consider whether I need to move on and try a new med or settle with this one.

I am in the diagnostic process of confirming suspected lupus as well as other autoimmune diseases and I think it may be drug-induced. Several psychiatric medications can cause drug-induced lupus and I am currently on two (lithium and Trileptal) and have been on several in the past (Abilify, Thorazine, etc.). 

I am seeing a rheumatologist this Friday and will of course ask him, but I want to be prepared before I go. My GP and psychiatrist say that drug-induced lupus is too rare for me to have it, but they also have been telling me there’s nothing wrong with me for the past three years when I actually did in fact have autoimmune disease(s). I just got lucky that my GP finally caught it after I borderline coerced him into testing me. 

If I do have drug-induced lupus, I don’t really know what I’ll do, because I can’t stop taking my current meds. I am finally stable and living fully after years of misery and trial and error with meds.";chr0nicallythrill

So I started going to university last year, there I've met that girl and we sort of clicked together right from the beginning, things were looking great. She was very open to me like to noone else before, we trusted each other and loved hanging out together, we shared similiar burdens of the past and understood each other like few people do. Up until 4 months ago when I had a talk with her friend about state of our relationship, she then told her and she got angry at me. But it quickly faded away and things went back to normal quickly. Then strange things started to happen, one week she was fine with me, the other she was either angry or disgusted with me for no reason, I couldn't figure out whats going on, but our relations got worse and worse with time. When I was completely convinced that it's over she always started showing signs that she still wants to get things back to normal, but there were also other strange things like she suddenly finding a boyfriend week after our argument, and that boyfriend is a guy she was never interested in, only as a friend. I was saying to myself ""alright things like that happen, it's time to move on"" but my guts the whole time were saying that somethings is not right about this whole mess, for example since our argument started she looks very depressed, she walkes around me like she would like to talk but for some reason she can't. Any attempt to talk has failed. 
And then I discovered the truth thanks to other person. We had 2 girls in our group of friends, the person that told me what's going on was pushed away by them and she knew them for couple of years already. This girl were hating me for no reason since the beginning, and they were tolerating me only because I was close with that girl, but when they saw that we're in argument, they made their move and started manipulating her, I don't know what they told her, but everything started to make sense, she's torn between her feeling for me and that twisted image of me implanted by them. Like me, that girl is a very intuitive person, and propably her guts like mine are also screaming that something is wrong, but she just can't get enough courage to talk to me, and she propably won't.

I was happy that finally I've found a right person, that I'll finally have a loving partner at my side, but as usual, someone had to destroy it. I've had situation like this before, and that person paid dearly when karma caught up with him, but I'm afraid that this time it will be too late and I'll lose her, what kind of twisted evil beinf you have to be to do things like that?";aDDOS12

I thought that my constant fears and my constant depression was perfectly normal. That every teenager was going through the exact same thing I was. 

       My dad is extremely Christian, and believes that through God all illness can be healed. He was skeptical at the time I started going to therapy, and believed it had no effect. So when I refused to go to school for the last few weeks, he attributed it to my laziness. “No pain no gain”, he said. What he doesn’t understand is mental illness, how I’ve been in so much pain all this time, and that I can’t bear to handle more. My therapy didn’t work initially, and that was because my illness was so far gone that simply talking about it wouldn’t help. My therapist really didn’t understand that. I saw him for a few months, but didn’t give me too much practical advice. I finally went to a psychiatrist a few days ago, and my diagnosis was major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, and ADHD. What I thought was normal for 3 years.... suddenly wasn’t. 

         My mother brought me to the psychiatrist and bought the medication, without the knowledge of my father. My father is strictly against medication, as he believes it could lead to drug use. If he was to find out, he would throw a fit. I imagine that he would throw my medication away. He gets extremely angry quite easily, so I can imagine that he would see this as my
Mother buying me drugs to help me with my nonexistent illness. 
   
         I wish that my father could understand my illness better. I wish that everybody could understand mental illness better. Before all this, when I talked to my friends about my problems, they thought I was being over dramatic, or maybe that I just need to find the motivation. Like my father, some of them believed that I was simply too lazy to go to school. And then, I started believing it too. It wasn’t mental illness, no, I’m just a bum.

I have been raised in a violent household. My dad has temper issues and it had been a difficult childhood to be honest. Once, I nearly lost my life because of an incident when my dad was drunk. He's out of jail now and his issues did not improve. He would usually start an argument and it would sometimes escalate to the point that it would be audible within our street. Sometimes, I get paranoid whenever I hear him speak. I'd usually resort to using my earphones whenever they do so.

My mom's anorexic and she no longer eats regularly. My sister's bipolar and she have had her fair share of suicidal tendencies, which I all assume is because of a violent childhood in a violent home. I don't talk with my family that much because I stay in our high school dormitory.

Anyways, that leaves me. In comparison, I look like the most decent one in our family. I'm an academic achiever en route to a topnotch university in my country. Outside our house, I'm kinda shy but nonetheless outgoing.

However, I've been feeling empty for a long time now. I know I am capable in terms of academics and even other stuff, but still I feel very incapable and ""not enough"". I'm slowly getting into alcohol and whenever I get drunk, I isolate myself and cry for hours at a time. Once, I jumped myself to a pool and basically left myself to drown not before my classmates pulled me out of the water. Sometimes, I swear I hear a faint noise of my parents' yelling (e.g. when I'm on my earphones) only for it to disappear when I try to focus my attention into it.

About 2-3 months ago I got shiitake dermatitis. This scared me a lot. I got treated with corticosteroids and had stress at work. Then I started getting these pangs of sadness randomly. This led to increased anxiety and throwing up in the mornings. Eventually I developed a lot of anxiety and couldn't go to work. At times I would feel better but panic attacks would make me feel shit again. Eventually I went to the hospital and they told me that my blood tests were ok, except I had very low vitamin D. So I started taking it and felt a bit better. I began to work out and push my self. During easter I ended up binge watching game of thrones with my friend for two-three days. This trigger a kind of existential crisis and anxiety. Im afraid every moment of the day, my head feels plagued by very intense thoughts of death and sadness. I have a hard time thinking about anything else. I been so exhausted for the past two months, feels like everyday is a struggle with a few moments of calmness from time to time. 

I am scared of living and I am scared to die. I am scared that my anxiety will kill me and I want to live but I can't stop thinking about existential thoughts. I can't focus on anything else.

Work has destroyed my spirit. Money has destroyed my spirit. I do not enjoy going outside or being around people anymore. I just feel sad all the time, even around my truly wonderful fiance.

I had a child with someone unexpectedly.   we hadn't been together too long but decided to try to make it work.  its been one of the hardest things I've ever been through.   he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  it got really bad at home while they were trying to figure his medication out.  and now he will go on and off his meds regularly, which leads to outburst of anger and meanness.  he has many other issues as well due to trauma he went through early on in life.  I have tried to be here for him through it, but it has taken a MAJOR toll on me.   im exhausted and don't feel like this is getting any better, but feel so incredibly guilty leaving. Ive tried to leave a couple times, but he makes me feel terrible for it, he says he will have to die before he quits fighting for this relationship.  but the whole relationship is me taking care of him.  I am in no way fulfilled.  I feel so trapped.  he recently bought a house.  I told him we were not in a place to buy together but if he wanted to he could. I had planned on living there and paying him rent.  however in the past couple weeks he has quit taking his meds twice, and I have caught him in a couple lies and im just so exhausted of it all.  I don't have the energy to try with this anymore. when I tell him he just ignores me or says no this isn't over.  I have told him I won't be moving into the house with him.  He says he bought it for me.  I feel so stuck in this.  there is no good solution. I am truly stuck for the foreseeable future and that makes me just want to break down and cry for days.";taranasaurusrexxxxxx

Since I first was depressed at 13, I’ve mostly been not feeling depressed until recently. From January this year to the beginning of April my depression was only getting worse. I think a lot of it is connected to how lonely I’ve been at college not having any friends or family around me. I’ve decided to transfer to a university closer to home (for many reasons along with my mental health) and since then I’ve been feeling slightly better. I’m actually excited and making plans for the summer. I don’t feel amazing, still, but I think I might feel a lot better once I’m actually home in a few days. I’m just scared that it’ll be bad again once my friends leave to go to their university and I’m stuck going to a school knowing nobody once again. I know SSRIs take about a month to even start working and I don’t want to feel how I felt a few weeks ago ever again. I also still have some really rough days where I don’t want to see anybody and I don’t want to do anything at all, but I also don’t want to do nothing. I just don’t want to exist sometimes still and I don’t even mean that in necessarily a suicidal way just that I want a break from existence every few days.;sparky_marcie

 Like most things in life you can't really fully understand it, until you go through it yourself.

I used to think that people who talked about being depressed a lot was mostly seeking attention and used it for an excuse to not do things they should be doing.

 I have had a terrible childhood.. and although I was depressed on and off growing up because of it, and always felt terribly alone..
I was  so strong in my young adult years, and I didnt let it get the best of me.
I set out to make a better life for myself and then for my children too.

But I have had one terrible event after another happen..
Although I am grateful, knowing that it could be worse.
I always pick myself back up and start over with a smile on my face..feeling invincible, that nothing can keep me down.

But after doing this so many times it has taken a toll on me.

Every time I've gotten my hopes up for things in life, that I can't help but long for from the depths of my being, those hopes have been crushed.

And now, I have been sinking more and more into circumstanceual depression.

I feel like this last hard knock completely broke me. Like I'll never be able to find that strength and at least mostly happy state again.

I have never felt so deeply hopeless to have the peace of mind and happiness I long for.

And now I understand, what it's really like to live with depression..how it really does take away your motivation for doing just about anything.. when you can't find joy where there used to be or should be joy.";xoAthenaxo

Firstly  iam in the shock that how this stupid life works and all of is a just dope show like stucking in the place where you are never belong , where you didn't disturb , where you will never choose ... it is feels like something or someone forsing you play the video game you hate most and worst thing is you can't create your own character , where you will spawn  or choosing difficulty . Worst thing is there is no dlcs to save your ass , everything is pay to win . An iam asking : What kind of sadistic psychopath would create a game that everyone , everything suffers relentlessly ? sometimes you can understand ,aware that you are in a video game but it is already scripted so you can't change it ...
It is worst game you will ever see and unfortunately you won't get a refund , from 0 -18 it is free trial but don't worry you will still suffer , you will feel the agony burning inside of you 
You are not pain free , don't look for cheat codes because there is none . And this game's name is :
Silent Hell , yes it is all starts when you are born and you see welcome to hell title on the screen than you start weeping  .
You can ask who is controlling me than ?  we won't know but probably he or she is a sadistic bastard ...  It is name is Silent Hell because when you are down , when you are sad or when you sad  no one understands you , gets you says i love you 
You feel lost , depressed , suffer and burning in your own hell , no matter what you do , how you look down no one else gives a laid , helps , no one fucking cares or notices that's why it is name is Silent Hell ...
If you know universe of Silent Hill games that the protogonist  founds himself or herself in a chaotic foggy world that surrounded with the demons 
Yeah it is not bad actually for me because atleast dealing with those creatures easier than dealing with the fucking people because you know those creatures intend , they are not torturing you mentally so if you are a doomguy type you can beat them all but about solving fucking puzzles i don't know . So which one would be more easier? , dealing with life& people or army of unholy monsters ?  Honestly i would choose monsters because i know humans creepier than them ...
Anyway enough that empty talking  . I am not mad at my life or what i have , everything is just too fucking  unfair , painfull and i can't take it anymore , iam not strong enough to handle this 
I am really trying my best but i am always found myself in the point that where i have started ...
Some people gets what they want or they disurb but iam not , iam a still a fucking loser , iam sick of playing this unfair game ... 
Like becoming crossed and feeling agonizing pain  in your all being.

So, next week I'm scheduled to get an implant placed. I decided given my unpredictable behavior it's better to have a reliable contraceptive method in place, also hoping that I'm lucky and it stops/reduces my period since I tend to get anemic and they make my depression way worse. 

However I also know the risks : mood swings caused by the new hormones, heavier periods... It's pretty much a matter of luck. I'll try it for 3 months and stop if it affects me badly. I'm really scared but also excited to see if it does me good. 

&#x200B;

I want to hear about other depressed individuals with the implant. How did it affect you? What are the positive/negative effects in general (pain, menstrual cycle, acne, mood...)? Is it better/worse compared to other methods you've tried?

99;Self Care tip from an Inuit person;30;bj0h68;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bj0h68/self_care_tip_from_an_inuit_person/;7;2019-04-30 04:23:18;"This might seem out of the blue so to speak. But I struggle with depression myself and occasionally find my way out due in large part to some of my spiritual beliefs, so I want to share them in case they can help someone else. I am an Inuit descended person from Labrador. The entire coast of Labrador was converted to Christianity almost overnight in 1804, but our way of life is not centered around a single community. Much of our time is spent in what we call ""the Big Land"", the countryside, where traditional hunting and spiritual practices are closer at hand than the looming church. Further north, there were Inuit shaman as late as the 1990s, and so some of the knowledge of a culture and spirituality thousands of years old has survived.

&#x200B;

Shaman had a number of responsibilities. Healing the sick was easily their weakest skill set (seriously one of their cures was to put a feather on a wound and blow on it). But for healing the sad and scared they had tremendous success, and communities lived or died by the love of their shaman. The shamanic healing art is primarily an act of love and that is why it works. There are no internal physical changes that need to take place for it to be effective, no surgery, punishment, or reward. All that is required is a relationship of trust with the shaman, so that as he tires on the healing journey, he can lean on you, and you on him, and you walk a road of healing together as friends. The journey is metaphysical, it is a search for a missing piece of your soul, that you find when you are in the loving arms of another human being.

&#x200B;

Now for the most important part of my post, I want to tell you an old secret: we are not the owners of our minds and bodies. We experience these things, but they are owned by another creature called an Inua. Inua own everything in the universe, even individual stones. It all belongs to an autonomous life force and a reality we don't get to physically touch, electromagnetism pushes every atom apart so we are mostly made of empty space. So what is an Inua? The word itself means owner, but Inua don't present themselves as physical entities: YOU are its physical entity. The Inua is often represented artistically as a one eyed woman or child, the one eye being an inner eye, because the Inua is as blind to our external reality as we are blind to our internal one.

&#x200B;

So how to apply this to self care? Well, realize that the mind and body get sick and die, but the Inua and its love are permanent. Just as a meteor leaves an impact crater, love leaves a beautiful mark on the world too. The world is created by love between animals and people building up over billions of years, so that each creature and each person leaves a  rock on the shore of time that will never wash away. We are the result of love we don't see or feel anymore, but it was here, and we stand on it blindly as sure as we stare blindly up at the night sky and don't see the gamma rays or X rays that are the most powerful forms of light.

&#x200B;

Take care of your Inua. It is the source of all peace and joy in your life, and it loves your body and your mind like a proud parent does. Like a child it wants to run and play and breathe easy and roll in the grass. But life is troublesome, and we get discouraged by obstacles, we get bogged down and feel inadequate to our jobs and goals, and then, we get sick inside. We verbally attack ourselves, put down our beautiful bodies, our unique minds, and the Inua hurts. It wants to show you the body it made for you, like a child holding up a drawing. When you put down this wonderful creation, it cries like a disappointed child. Don't put down your Inua. Don't hurt its feelings. Learn to want what your Inua wants, love what it does, what it can create, recognize what is possible for you because you have a gift from a strange and unknowable Source.

&#x200B;

When you are best friends with your Inua you will find the greatest happiness in life. As I said I struggle with depression due to my circumstances, but I have honestly never hated or attacked myself. In the forest of depression, I often see a light through the trees: my own light. Someday I know my Inua will guide me out of the dark woods forever. :)

Susto, Sweet Soul

To the hills I went looking for you

Because it was there I saw you first

I’m lost and I don’t want to burden my sweet parents with living in the house with them being a waste of space and resources. I want to move out and do something but I don’t know what that is...

So I have 2 weeks or less to figure it out or I- really don’t know... I get small bursts of inspiration like many others here but the next morning, it’s gone. Alternatively I could die, but I  can’t bring myself to kms (parents and I fear death), although that option is becoming more and more appealing. 

TLDR; 2 weeks to figure shit out or I probably won’t be around for much longer. (Not that many people care lol)";Crisiwolf24

Current inescapable thought is about how unfair it is that the world can be as ugly as it is, yet it’s up to me to add additional things into my schedule like meditation and exercise and anti-rumination activity, to introduce foreign and disgusting medications to my body, to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a doctor repeat to me over and over again the mistakes I make and describe my self sabotage in hundreds of different ways. 

Current fear is that I won’t make it to the time in our existence when the stigma is lifted and we all have access to the type of life we need to survive and be the appropriate family member, friend, employee or community member that the world demands us to be. 

I’ve hit the giving up point. It has been 15 years and I have fought harder than I’ve ever seen anyone fight, I’ve looked for ways over, under, around issues, I’ve spent a house deposit worth of money, I’ve ruined relationships trying to be someone I’m not and it’s clear to me the older I get the harder it is to garner the energy you need to keep giving a fuck.

&#x200B;

I wanted to break up and she still loves me. I kept trying to dig myself into a bigger and bigger hole, and just couldn't stop.

&#x200B;

I don't think this relationship is a good match and haven't for a while, but I realize that I need help, and I don't know what else I can be doing to help when I never have episodes like these anymore. I did before but I managed my hormone and stress levels, and then I was fine. I see a therapist regularly and haven't had issues like these in years, and they've been managed just fine until now.

&#x200B;

I have anxiety and depression, and Celexa manages that well. I have autism so I know I have a hard time processing things, and know when I'm having an anxiety attack so I remove myself from stressful situations to calm down. 

&#x200B;

I take testosterone, but that usually doesn't mess with my mood unless I'm already really stressed. Breaking up is obviously stressful, so it sent me off the edge since Monday is the day I have the most testosterone in me (injection day).  When I'm really hormonal I get episodes of extreme anger and just spiral into destructive behavior. I took my Celexa once I started to become conscious again but the damage was already done, and I couldn't stop saying horrible things to get my girlfriend to hate me.

I want help to manage my bipolar symptoms, but I rarely ever have them. What can I do now?

Its taken a few weeks bit I'm starting a new job real close to home in 5 hours that's gonna get me back on my feet.

One thing I've come to realize through this last month is that it doesn't matter how happy you can make someone else if you put yourself behind all these other things in life eventually it'll catch up to you and you'll be suffering from it. And having all that extra weight on your shoulders from not taking care of yourself drags you down quicker than anything

I tear up a little when writing things like this and if I tell people this, they just tell me to talk to about it to other people but once I do they don't listen. I adapt to situations far too easily, example, being invited to a party; Once I join the party, I start to adapt to it by joining a random group, just shouting or smiling is somehow enough. I don't do the ""cutting my wrists"" or ""hanging"" kind of suicide, I kind of just degrade my whole body until I can't anymore. Right now I'm on the stage that it's hard to breath because I strangle myself with wires sometimes I even choke because of it, I feel random chest pains but it doesn't seem like a heart attack, is this considered as suicide? And there's this one time that I was shaking vigorously non-stop, it wasn't cold or anything, It's just shaking until I can't move my legs.

Once I saw that, I immidiately tried to stop and somehow just told them that I was just tired and just said sorry then once I got out of my room I tried to tell them that I have depression and anxiety but as most parents in my country, they only pass it off as I'm tired or I need sleep. Come to think of it, am I just constrained here? I once was a smart kid from elementary to grade school, going for medals and being a honor student, every time there was an examination/test, I was pushed to study till midnight, mind you, I was still 7-8 years old at this point. I sometimes started crying because I want to sleep but I can't since I just missed a couple of homework and needed to ""follow up"" my grades since they ""dropped""

This is a long post, sorry to bother you but I'm just kind of telling my life so If you have read it until here, thank you

I still had a happy childhood, I think so. I can play outside with friends and everything but I was a cry baby so I cry once I can't catch up to anyone in tag or I can't find anyone in hide and seek and they tease me for it. I just tell this to my parents and of course, they tell me ""boys don't cry"" b.s. every time so it kinda had a mark on me. I also take coins and such from my parent's cabinets and I get caught, as any parents with do, they scold me that I will be this and that but I was a thick headed kid then and improved every time I get caught. I also wrote I hate them in a way so. This made them lose trust in me, I was freed from their grasp or so I told myself. Once I got to high school, I was ""free"" to do anything. I was invited to a birthday party and asked them If I could go, they instantaneously guilt trip me that they bought me everything or is what I think right now, maybe it's just my anxiety that made me think this, anyways, I was guilt tripped most times as, I would think, every parent does. I felt so much guilt that I even go to school even when I have a cold or don't feel good,  it continued until now, I'm Grade 11 now and it started on 2015, I became somehow numb of my sickness my brain (and body I guess) started to ignore my cold, as all you know of course, colds somehow makes you whole body feel hot to the touch, well, I don't know when but it started to hide some of my sicknesses' symptoms and you'll know only if I tell you.

All of this turned me into some kind of robot that runs on autopilot which only do is being a burden and waste of resources.

136;Life after university;2;bizv5d;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bizv5d/life_after_university/;0;2019-04-30 10:58:14;"Ever since I left university 3 years ago (I graduated with a BA in Creative Writing) my life has been going in a downward spiral. Pretty much all the friends I made left the city (London) and I chose to stay as I was determined to seek my career here, didn't have a home to go back to. 

All the jobs I have been doing are cleaning jobs, something that I always tried to avoid as each job felt soul destroying each time. I don't have anyone to talk to at work primarily because of the language barrier, me being the only english speaking person, ironic since I work in London. Getting told off for the most minute and meaningless things made me very nervous and has affected the way I interact with people. I've  put up a lot of racist, sexist and homophobic abuse in my current job (Being a white, gay man from England). I've gone so far away from what I wanted to do that it seems almost impossible to break into a career that suits me.

My only saving grace is my partner that I met 2 years ago at a cinema. We share common interests, I did admit to him I have being diagnosed with depression and he accepts me for who I am. I am just so ashamed of myself. I keep on thinking that I don't deserve him, he knows about my job issues and knows it has made me into a wreck, I apply for jobs every day after work in some vain hope I don't get another cleaning job. I'm 27 years old yet I feel like I'm 72, I feel just so out of touch. I'm afraid to tell my partner that I have had suicidal thoughts in recent weeks. I don't think I can keep on living and feeling like I am.";RetroMc

138;woke up and this stupid poem about stupid shit poured out of my stupid soul;2;bizu8u;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bizu8u/woke_up_and_this_stupid_poem_about_stupid_shit/;0;2019-04-30 10:54:48;"I want to die.

That's my first thought in the morning once I open my eyes and realize who I am. I shut off my alarm and stare blankly at the ceiling... and sometimes i cry.

I cry, and beg for any sort of omniscient, all-powerful diety to just... Bring me peace.  

and then my second alarm goes off exactly 5 minutes later and I get out of whatever bed, couch, or even up off the goddamn floor and I'm forced to go on with my day as if I'm not praying for a meteor or some other freak accident every waking second. 

I have a whole fucking alarm set for 5 minutes before I have to actually get up just so I can have a little bit of time to muster up the courage to... To just go on.

This internal battle has a thousand words of anger- cause anger is the easiest emotion to cover up sadness. It's the easiest way to lock it away. 

I lock it away in a box and I have to struggle to my wit's end to keep that box shut. I use work and hobbies and even fucking drugs to keep the stupid tape on the stupid box. 

But i have to go on. That's what everyone says, right? But my box is overflowing and it gets harder and harder every single fucking day as more and more shit just keeps pouring in. 

But i see where the sidewalk ends, and I desperately want to turn around. The light at the end of my tunnel is just a train. 

""It'll be alright"" i tell myself. 

""I'll be fine"" I say.

I speak these words of encouragement, hoping they resound and rattle around my stupid brain. 

this shit sucks. There's no better way to describe it... And I genuinely wish that nobody else ever has to feel this way, but I know better. I know my thoughts and my words might hit too close to home for people i may have never met. 

But i must go on. I'm tired of hearing this voice inside my head telling me that the alternative is my only option. 

But I must go on.";barbadurkle

I need to pursue a career as an athlete. I quit after my first year of college because I realized the importance of education. However, I never realized the importance of sports and competition to me... Until this summer, I began working out again and planned to compete for fun, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't show up. I was stuck in my head.

I am at my dream school, but this place doesn't make me happy like I thought it would. I've learned a lot during my pursuit of higher education, so I don't regret trying to pursue it. I just can't see myself in any typical career that higher education might lead to. I think I'll finish my last year and half here just going through the motions more or less. In other words, I'll treat school more like a hobby maybe, and I'll begin simultaneously pursuing my true dream that has been haunting me these past 3 years. I can't quit school now because I promised my parent I'd finish. I think I placed too much importance on the idea of education and not enough on what I love and what makes me happy.

Being depressed has made me feel like anything I do is pointless anyways since I see life as being quite pointless. So I may as well do that pointless thing that made me happy. Pursuing a career as an athlete may not make me happy at the end of the day, but I won't know if I don't try. And I know I'll end up with a bullet in my head sooner if I give up on my dream for good because I am certainly not happy with where I am now.

I've been wanting to get my foot in the entertainment industry door, even though I'm also passionate about child welfare. No, combining them both is not what I need. I want to make fun light hearted entertainment. I may not have the confidence to be screen-material just yet, but a recent animation opportunity has popped up. I don't even have the right software to do it, but tomorrow I'm going to apply for it!

I've been searching and searching for a place to throw pottery without having to take a 6-week goddamn master course and by golly, after months, I finally found one! I'm going to book a space tomorrow for asap.

I got a painting for someone else I've been procrastinating on because I think it's ugly.

I just watched Avengers: Endgame yesterday and I left the theater feeling pretty upset, not because of the movie per se (although it was sad) but because of the references they made to some of the other big movies in the franchise. 

After seeing the references, the years the movies came out, and seeing the excitement of all those people who had been fans of the franchise and watching it build up to this moment for years and years I began to get really sad that I had kind of missed this big moment and experience that I could of shared with millions. 

In a way, kind of did experience the moment, but only a little bit. I watched Iron Man when it came with my dad because he was obsessed with it and I enjoyed that moment. I saw Captain America: Civil War with one of my friends in theatres and, even though I was going through a good time in my life at that point, I still remember that moment (even though I was totally out of the loop because I had only seen Iron Man before then). 

But basically, I've only ever seen like 3 Marvel movies and I thought back to 2012 when the first Avengers movie came out. In 2012 I was really happy and had a great time hanging out with friends and following the election that year. I especially remember the Summer and all the fun I had then, but I still feel like that I could have made more memories had i seen the Avengers then and shared that cultural moment.

Now, even though i can go back and watch the movie, I can never back and share that cultural moment and it makes me really sad. It makes me feel like i really missed out on something that I can never get back.";_KnowYourPlace_

I'm a girl with excessive body hair and irregular periods, which means I most likely have PCOS, I'm a dumbass and can't do basic things anymore, my Grandma is getting older and she is slowly getting worse and worse, I will lose everyone in my life and end up being alone, I will never find someone that finds me attractive, I hate my body hair and avoid mirrors because when I look at myself I feel so depressed and suicidal I can't even describe it. No one in my family takes me seriously and thinks I'm being dramatic even though I have chest hair, and leg hair worse than every guy I've ever met. The hair growth is only getting worse, and I can't do anything about it. I literally have hair on my boobs and my family doesn't care because they think it's normal even though it clearly isn't normal for a female to have hair on her chest. I have stomach hair that stops me from wearing things I want to. My self esteem is so low and I can't stand looking at myself anymore. Why can't my family realize that something is wrong? Sometimes I wish I had the right to go to the doctor without my parents permission and just figure all of this out, but I'm only 15. 

&#x200B;

The body hair has destroyed my self esteem and I hate everything about my body. I look so ugly. There's literally nothing I want to do more than kill myself but I can't. For some reason something in me is telling me things will get better. But seeing how everything has turned out, clearly that's not true. 

&#x200B;

I don't see a point in not killing myself. I have friends, but when they see how hairy I am they'll leave me. I have family, but my Grandma won't be alive much longer and I'll lose everyone by the time I'm 40. I have no skills and ever since I've become so sad I don't like doing anything anymore. I won't be able to make anything of my life, and I won't have anyone to spend it with. Why should I stay here if the majority of my life will be alone and miserable?

&#x200B;

I don't even see myself alive after high school. I can't handle how much body hair I have now, I won't be able to handle it when it's gotten worse. 

&#x200B;

I remember one time I was in Algebra class, and a boy who i considered (still consider) my friend came up to me and said:

""You have hair on your chin"" 

He laughed and I remember my heart dropping and feeling as if I could cry right then and there. I don't even remember what I learned in class that day. All I remember is who i thought was a good friend comment on the one thing i hate about me the most. And now that it's noticeable, how are others going to react? Granted he's always been rude, that's just his personality, and that's just the way he acts with everybody, but it still hurt. He's said a lot of things to me, but that one destroyed me.

I remember another time where I was in English class, sitting next to my best friend, and taking my jacket off. When I took my jacket off he said:

""Jesus Christ why are your arms so fucking hairy lol"" 

He said it in a joking term (hence the ""lol"") but it still hurt. He said he was kidding, but cleary if my best friend thought that way, then others do too. 

I haven't gone to school or anywhere without a jacket or hoodie since those two days. I cover my chin when I talk to people. I don't look my friend in the eyes. I don't even look family members in the eyes anymore. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just don't understand. I never asked for this. I never wanted this. I just wanted to be normal. i never asked to be perfect, hell I never even asked to be somewhat attractive, but being normal would have been nice. I don't see why this happened to me. I don't see why i have to be so hairy and why it's getting worse. I lost weight because I thought that would help the hair growth slow down, but that didn't work. I've been on a low carb, no sugar diet for a year now, it isn't incredibly strict but I still do it. That hasn't helped either.

I never asked to have a perfect life with no problems, but I would have like to at least see some progress when i'm working hard to fix them Instead I was given an unfixable problem that will only get worse no matter what exercise, diet or maybe even medication I take, since with pcos medication is really just a shot in the dark.

&#x200B;

When I was a kid, i would think about one day finding someone and having a family, and that's been taken away. When I was kid, I pictured myself being smart, hard working, and having a good career, but here I am, so sad I can't even muster up the effort to finish projects I have. Here I am not being able to understand basic concepts, and not having the energy to try. As I kid I would always wonder of the wonderful things I would have as an adult, now when I think about being an adult, I think about how miserable I'll be, sitting alone with no one, thinking about all the people I've lost. As I kid I would think about growing up, but now I think about how I probably won't be alive in 10 years.

&#x200B;

How did I get here, why did I get here? Should I have seen it coming? 

&#x200B;

Maybe I don't deserve to be happy. Maybe I deserve to be ugly and lonely. Or maybe I'm being dramatic. I don't know. All I know is that I'm sick of waking up hating my body. I'm sick of feeling lonely and not wanting to be around people both at the same time. I'm tired of things getting worse and worse, and me not being able to do anything about it. I'm tired of being me. All i want to to not be me. I don't want to die, no human desires the feeling of no longer breathing, no human desires for their heart to stop beating, but I do desire to no longer have the life that I have. I desire to longer be in the body that I have. i desire to stop waking up feeling like the weight of the world is on my shoulders and even though I've tried lifting it off, there always seems to be something weighing on me. I do desire to longer live the life I live. I don't want to die, it's not something I want to do because it seems enjoyable, I want to do it because living isn't enjoyable anymore as well.

People say it gets better but it fucking doesn't. It's been a year dealing with all this and things have only gotten worse.

I never feel happy. I'm homeless. On paper I should be happy I workout everyday. Read new books everyday. I have food, gas, a car to sleep in. Not addicted to anything but caffeine. I just want myself to be gone. My happiest moments are when I sleep. I don't dream it's just pitch black and then I wake up. I genuinely wish I was enough of an asshole to push them away so they wouldn't miss me when I'm gone. I've tried multiple times and lately I've taken to mental and physical self harm it keeps me at Bay. Stuck my hand in a fire ants nest on purpose just to let the little fuckers sting me. No matter what I do I'm miserable. Almost was killed by a drunk driver and I was happy when they told me I was bleeding inside if my parents weren't there I would have refused surgery. Why should I live my life for others? It's my life and if I want to end it why shouldn't I? Idk I'm not happy with 6 figures I'm not happy with freedom. I just want to die. If my dad wasn't everything I don't want to be I'd just put every chem in my system and see what happens but hard drugs ain't me but I think about it. I think because of seeing it so young it's just normal in my head. My father was murdered and my mom thinks that's why I'm fucked up but no mom I'm fucked in the head cause I was molested, raised half the time by a drug addict who threw me in a box full of narcotics and a .22 and told to shoot anyone who opened the box without doing the knock. I'm fucked in the head because I was struck for being left handed by the same man. I'm fucked in the head because the man I wished was dead for years wasn't murdered by my own hands for Everytime he laid hands on you. I just wish I wasn't alive. I'm dead inside and I hope my sister doesn't outlive me so I can just put a bullet in my head at her funeral. Last living soul I will ever care about.

At this is time I didn't have many friends (a few from elementary, and some from middle school) but all the time I knew them I never talked all that much and almost never hanged out with them after school. I think this is when the feelings of loneliness began to manifest.

Skip to now, (20 years old) I haven't talked to any of my school friends since, except for one friend a texted briefly a year after graduation but it never lead to anything other than a small catch up of things. And so, I no longer have any friends or acquaintances. 

I did go to college for only a year and dropped out because the environment was gradually making my social anxiety worse and worse and when I thought I could barely handle just the cycle of going to class, a few hours of relaxing, sleeping, and repeat, my mom was constantly pressuring me to find a job to pay for the smaller expenses (I didn't argue and I tried finding a job, not very hard though), but I was scared of losing the small amount of time I had between after classes and sleep to let off steam. So I pretty much caved after the semester ended and just said ""fuck that, I'm going to lose my damn mind if I have to deal with all that.' even though I had decent grades and good scholarships which made me feel even more guilty for dropping out. 

4 months after the semester ended and I didn't go back to college, I got my first job, then another 4 months later I quit (because the constant, inconsistent work schedule was driving me mad) and I got another job which is where I'm currently employed (which also has an inconsistent work schedule, but way more tolerable than than the last job's). But ever since I started working, the idea of waking up, go to work, go home, sleep, repeat really gets me depressed and I start thinking stuff like ""This isn't a life worth living if i'm just doing this shit til I die with no one to comfort me, I should just kill myself now.""

As of the past few years, this depression feels like it has taken all the enjoyment out of the things that I would used to love and use as an escape/distraction. I barely have fun playing video games anymore and I usually get frustrated about something while playing them, I've nearly completely lost interest in drawing (which I loved to do when I was younger) which I've been trying to force myself to do it more but I just stop and think about how my drawing just isn't as good as I want it to be. Along with this and having no friends and a family that barely communicates with me, I just see don't a life worth living for me with my social anxiety, my personality, and isolation. It just feels like I'm not strong enough for this world and that suicide would just save me from a life of loneliness.

I have never attempted suicide, I hold myself back every time I think about going to do it because I just end up thinking about how it would make my mom feel or how I would feel if I had a child and they had left my life like that. My mom is also a widow, 43 years old, my dad died nearly 7 years ago from a seizure while recovering in the hospital, and thinking about her having to live the rest of her life with both of our deaths just dreads me with guilt from the thought of killing myself.  

I have gone to 3 therapists in the past. The first didn't really help me at all and stopped going after a few months. The second felt like it was helping somewhat at first, but only briefly, and then said something along the lines of that 'they're here to be a tool to help myself' which I had not the slightest clue in what I should do to help myself and after 2 more sessions I stop going. The third was kind of horrible and felt like he was trying to rush me out at soon as possible (not rudely) which I assume was because I wasn't communicating much, and stopped going because of that and also because the medical insurance I had was taken away / revoked (because of a total income increase) and havent really been able to visit another therapist since I don't have the money to pay for one out of pocket.

Lately, I just feel lonely, sad, and confused about my life. I just don't know what to do.

Ever since then I've been too scared to drive and my driving permit has since expired and I'm not in any way interested in getting it renewed. I'm 17 so people keep asking when I'll get my license and it's getting harder to come up with reasons other than the real ones: I'm scared the car will break while I'm driving it  and I'll crash again or I'll crash on purpose to hurt myself. 

My parents tried to understand my feelings a few months after the accident, but now they're starting to pressure me into driving again. I don't know how to tell them the truth without getting put in the hospital again and I never get any better when I'm there. My therapist knows about how I feel but in her words ""if you wanted to kill yourself using the car you would have done it by now."" So I just feel like I'm faking it even though it's all I can think about when my parents bring up the idea of me driving. 

I've been off my antidepressants for a few months (secretly) and I know myself well enough to know that if I had a legal way to drive a car I'd kill myself as soon as I could. 

I'm going to be a senior next year in a rural school so not being able to drive myself places is really inconvenient to me and my friends/family. I don't know what to do and it's killing me. Any advice would be appreciated because I have no idea what I'm going to do.";iliketothinkimcool

169;Sorry;1;bizawa;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bizawa/sorry/;0;2019-04-30 09:45:12;"I've never did one of these before. So I'll try my best. 

I kinda want to preface this by saying throughout the last few years I keep trying to tell myself I'm just sad, and not depressed. Maybe thinking if I keep lying to myself enough one day I'll believe it. I've always been one who tries to help others, because being able to see someone happy off of me being able to help them is the kinda thing I live for. I care about the people around me and want the best for them. So I try to do all I can for them to be alright and help them move forward. The only problem is I find myself being able to help others but never being able to help myself. 

I think it hit me the hardest when I moved to America in 2015, I left everything in my home country and the move was rough. I lost everything. Ever since then it's been an uphill battle. The culture shock was a lot harder than I imagined and I ended up being alone for a good 3 years. Eventually senior year I was able to make 3 good friends that helped me take my mind off the struggles and push ahead. It was really nice and refreshing to have them by my side. But after I graduated I moved again and started back at ground zero. Realizing I was still attached to my old habits I had when I came to America. Such as cutting my self off from other people to try my best for self preservation and not get mixed into complicated issues with people in the school I went too (not the nicest of school if you know what I mean). Eventually finding myself in the same place back then, alone, afraid, and now trying to figure out who I am as a person all at the same time. It was a little overwhelming but I tried my best to get through it.

I'm about to finish my first year of college. While the first semester wasn't too crazy, the biggest challenge to try to over come was trying to change my life style. Being lost on what I want to do in life while trying to get everything else in order has taken a bit of a toll over time. Normally I always have my ""escapes"", I promised myself I would never do drugs and alcohol when I'm sad and have been able to stick to that promise. But my normal escape isn't doing it for me anymore and I'm starting to get worried. Normally I always play some games that will take my mind off things and help me regroup and keep my mind straight to take on the challenges ahead of me, either that or take a nap as a refresher. 

But as of late neither have been doing it for me and I am growing a great fear on what I'm becoming. Because I know I'm not supposed to feel good right now, I should be trying to push to get better. But every time I try I feel like I get slammed back down to the ground 2x harder. I'm starting to get numb to the things around me and it's starting to scare me. 

If I care about what's happening that means I haven't given up. But because I'm starting not to care I'm getting scared I might be losing my grip. All I know is I'm not going to kill myself because I don't want to give up. I've always been one to fight and try my best. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to help people and cheer up people's day and make them laugh and smile. But it's just too hard to do that right now and I know I just have to focus on myself right now. 

I tried explaining the best I could about what's been on my mind these last few months.

Dammit, you are here again.

Why so soon? You usually don't visit me this often. I was just done clearing the mess you left last time. And I thought I was doing so well.

Okay, I know I am a worthless piece of shit. But I try. I try really hard to be a nice person to everyone and do my job. Yes, my job sucks and it may lead nowhere. But I try. I really do try to live with a positive attitude. I just finished writing a new set of goals and I was doing so well. I started running again. Wasn't running supposed to help me? What made you come back so early? Am I not eating healthy enough? 

Why does no one like me? Why am I always trying so hard? I always conclude that I don't need to try too hard (because (1) nobody gives a shit; and (2) (omit). I really want to do well and be successful and happy and have actual friends who care about me as much as I care about them. And I truly truly believe that I deserve all of that. And I try hard and I believe myself and I try and I try to wake up early and run and do the dishes and clean the house and try not to drink to avoid my feelings and I asked my friends ""how are you?"" to which they don't even bother to fucking respond yet have the audacity to update their instagram story. Why do I even try? Because I believe that I can fucking win this. I believe that I can overcome you and all of this and be the fucking badass that I always dreamed to be. I just want you, Depression, to know that I am really trying fucking hard not to kill myself and take the easy way out. Of course, I want to kill myself. I get that desire EVERYDAY! Even when you are not here. It's just part of me. And I know that I should get rid of that thought, but it's become a part of my identity that I don't even know how to. How do I get rid of a part of myself?

So I want you to go back to wherever the fuck you came from. Because this is a very important time of my life and I reallllllly don't need you. OK, I know you have been with me since as long as I can remember. Yes, I acknowledge you and I won't be the person I am right now if it weren't for you. But NOT NOW. Let me make just a tiny bit of progress to assure myself that I am right, not you. I am right and I believe it. But I need to prove to myself and to others that I am right. So please go back to wherever the fuck you came from. Come back later. I will welcome you with a bottle of wine (I'll spent more than $20, I promise) and I will listen to sad songs and sob silently in my room with you. BUT NOT FUCKING NOW. Go back.

I hate talking to someone about how I really fucking feel. I fucking hate trying to explain
myself to another person. It's bullshit, because the person trying to help you can only do so through the scope of their own worldview, perspective, and understanding. So you have to ""click"" with them. It's bullshit. I don't click with anybody. I don't give a shit. I have terrible social skills, no confidence, and social anxiety.

I'd rather fucking die then have anyone's respect, including my own. I wish I was never at this place in my existence. I wish I could just turn it all off and sleep for eternity.

I was really scared last night because I was really close to suicide. I have never hurt myself, but I know i have enough meds to overdose. last night i talked to a friend and he kept me here, but i am alone and i dont know what to do.;cerabelle3

I can’t remember the last time I had a good day. I am finally at the point where I cry myself to sleep. Food isn’t filling, my hobbies are no longer fun, I haven’t smiled or laughed in I don’t know how long. I suffer in silence. My family thinks I’m doing ok. It doesn’t really matter if they thought I wasn’t doing well. They don’t support mental health and most of them are narcissistic. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live. I used to dream. I barely sleep now. I don’t even find pleasure in sleeping. It’s as if my body doesn’t care what it’s doing. It all just feels the same. I have a 3 year old daughter and I am failing her miserably. I just want to wake up one morning and not have the weight of depression and loneliness lingering over me all day. I never thought I’d find comfort in the idea of being alone but it’s been easier to acclimate to being alone then trying to force people to care I exist. My heart physically hurts when I think about all this hurt I have. I don’t know how much longer I can feel this way. I just want to be numb.;toadflakes88

I was 15 at the time. The main thing that chewed away at my mind this cycle was an overwhelming feeling that I was the scum of the Earth. Everything I did or said to anyone felt either stupid or mean. In my head, I was the worst person I had ever met. 

           Though I was going through this, I had a friend that made me feel like I wasn’t alone. I felt like I could be myself around her. She could make me laugh, I could make her laugh. We’d have conversations that felt important to us at the time. She knew me to the core of my being, vise versa. One day we got into an argument that ended up with her not talking to me for a month. This made me feel absolutely disgusting. The person who knew me most in the world hated me. We spent most of our time together before the argument, so I didn’t have any other friends besides her. I felt completely  alone. 

          About two weeks after the argument I watched a movie with my dad. I made some comment that offended him, so he became angry. He was angrily pacing around the room when he said, “Maybe *friends name* is right, you are a bitch.”  Then he walked away. Shortly after that he went to work, leaving me alone in my house. I laid in my bed in a catatonic state. I was in a thought loop starting with his words echoing in my head, then thinking of all he ways he was right, then thoughts of how to kill myself. I stared into the ceiling, in this loop, totally still, for two hours. Near the end of I was just trying to get the energy to get out of bed and go through with it. 

           My plan was to bike to the rite-aid down my street, steal a few different pill bottles and a bottle of wine, lock myself in one of the upstairs rooms (the rite aid in my city is part of a strip mall, and there was a hallway that one could go down from the main part of the store that had a bunch of creepy rooms that appeared to never be used,) quietly overdose, and finally rot away until an employee notices the smell and discovers my corpse. I went through with the plan until I was sitting in this room with the wine by my side and the pills in my hand. My conscious brain was screaming at me to do it, but I couldn’t bring my hand to my mouth. I didn’t consciously know why my hand wouldn’t move. It was as if my subconscious was desperately searching for a reason for me to stay alive, and it wouldn’t let me do it till it had thoroughly searched itself. 

             Suddenly, the screaming demands of death were interrupted with the thought of my mom. I love her and she loves me. I thought of the state she would be in if I killed myself. I thought of all the catatonic staring she would do if I were gone. I knew I couldn’t do that to her. It was then that I realized the true meaning of love. It’s a trap that forces you to stay alive despite life being such a pain. Edgy I know but it’s still goddamn true. I threw the stuff I stole away, biked back home and went to sleep. 

            It’s been about 26 months since that day. My friend forgave me and we are still very close to this day. I’ve laughed since then. I’ve grown. I’ve learned. I’ve experienced so much joy. I don’t regret not killing myself. In fact I’m happy I didn’t. I still, however, think that love is a trap the forces you to keep on fighting.";Loopybop

I am a 22f, been dealing with chronic, severe depression since I was 17.

Here's the rundown:

I always knew I was sad, having a terribly abusive father throughout my childhood. I would describe my home as being a psychological torture chamber. When I was 17 y/o I was stalked by a classmate and had to move towns. Moved into a new city with my mom, where I experienced my first severe depressive episode. Could barely function, had to be babysat by family friends, forced to take showers and brush my teeth, binge eating 3,000-4,000 calories in a sitting then starving myself. Was prescribed Escitalopram (now at 40mg), graduated high school, moved to a new town in Colorado, where I thought I could start fresh. 'Not so fast', said my depression, and despite being in intensive therapy in this new town, couldn't shake it. Left school after my freshman year to find myself. Traveled a lot. It was fun. Most of the time I was depressed, so I could never enjoy it as much as I wish I could. Last year, was assaulted on New Year's Eve. Went to the ER, was placed in inpatient for suicide watch. Mood rehabilitation program for 6 weeks. Worked my ass off in community college, applied to my new university 3 times before I was accepted. Now, at my new university. I'm going for social work.

I work really hard. The only thing I don't commit to is taking my medicine. As soon as it starts to kick in, I self-sabotage and something in my brain tells me I don't need it. I become apathetic. I crash, again, again, again, again. I've had a major depressive episode every single year since I was 17.

I can't shake it. My depression is ruining my life. I fuck up all my professional opportunities and commitments. I make it to work, because I need to make rent. I sleep until 5pm, I feel numb, I cut out my friends, I spend thousands of dollars that I don't have. I have all the resources- psychiatrist, therapist, medicine, etc.

I can't do it. I'm tired of treading water. I'm tired of fighting. I need help, please.";maarilibra

186;My First Suicide Attempt;2;biyzfa;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biyzfa/my_first_suicide_attempt/;4;2019-04-30 09:07:48;"Note / I just posted this on another thread, but maybe this community can offer some advice or ideas? 
This might be a little long, so I apologize in advance. 
I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts, I am currently 17 (F), and things have taken a turn for the worse. A lot has happened in my personal life this past year, parents divorcing, death of a close family member (suicide) and losing connection with close friends. 
Sunday, I drove to Florida (~3 hrs) from my house in efforts to leave my mothers house and go stay with my dad. My dad was very abusive when we were all in the same household, and ever since my mother filed for divorce he questioned my paternity until a court administrated test proved he was my father. He lives in my deceased aunts house, (yes, the one who committed suicide less than a year ago,) and as I was driving I knew I hated my mom, but my hatred for him was a little stronger and deeper. I turned around and drove home, with small part of me hoping my mother would want to talk, say sorry for all the mean things she’s done. Instead she pulled my hair, dragged me to the backyard, and chased me to my car and told me not to come home. 
I drove to Walmart, when I walked in my face was red, scratch marks all up and down my arms, hair matted and a mess. I avoided eye contact, and walked to the medicine aisle. I bought benadryl, and bought razor heads. At check out I make jokes with the cashier, small talk to avoid any questions. 
I drove to another Walmart in town, this one about 25/30 minutes from my home. I filled my car with gas and found a spot to park where there was little people. I took out each individually wrapped benadryl and took over 20 pills. My car has no AC, and it was around 75-80 degrees and I was sweating like crazy. I came to the conclusion after 2 hours it wasn’t going to do anything, and I needed to try something else. 
I walked into Walmart, again to the medicine aisle and saw tylenol. I remember looking up suicide methods and showing tylenol kills your liver, and thought I had found what I was looking for. I grabbed an extra strength (500mg) bottle and checkout. I went back to my car, and took probably 15-20ish pills (I don’t remember, I know a couple out of the 25 pill pack fell on the floor so it’s an estimate.) 
I still after an hour felt fine, and just concluded I needed to sleep. 
I woke up at 2am (had no phone, just saw the clock on the car dash) and threw up. I kept throwing up, then concluded I should go home. I don’t know if I was dreaming or not, but my car would not start, I couldn’t go. It was on a two lane road in pitch black ( I hope it was a dream.) 
I drove home while constantly swerving off the road into other lanes (I felt the bumps of swerving into different lanes.) I was hallucinating that a former boyfriend was in my passenger seat, saying things that killed me inside. I actually thought he was there, I don’t know why, probably the pills. 
I made it home, (looking back I don’t even remember driving home, just little fragments of driving off the road.) I could not find a garage door opener, and I still thought my ex was in the car, I got up to go to the backdoor gate and my legs were jello. I could not feel them very well, and my whole body felt weak. I went to my car a couple times to “look” for the opener, but probably just thought I was looking. I went to the back gate and knocked on the door for my mother to answer. She let me in, and said something I do not remember. I probably don’t even want to remember. I asked for my phone, then I went into my room. I don’t remember anything until I woke up vomiting light brown chunks all over my floor, unable to make it to my bathroom in time. 
The next morning (today) my stomach has been hurting and I feel weak. My mother asked why I threw up, I just said I wasn’t feeling well. How do I tell my mother I tried to kill my self and failed? 
Today we argued, she wrote me a letter with all the rules I have to follow, I ripped it up in her face. I took 10 advil a while ago,( knowing it won’t do anything, I just felt the urge to take something.) 
Now I am sitting in my room, miserable, thinking about what is next. What am I going to do? I just want to end this shit, my life is not worth it, the struggle of every.  single.  day.  Is not worth it anymore. 
I don’t know what to do, do I try again and hope it works this time? Do I try another method. Please tell me how to end it.";justanothernumber-

The seasonal depression is hanging on longer than expected in southern Michigan thanks to the dismal weather from Mother Nature. 

The highlights of recent are that my job now allows me to work from home which really helps cover these detrimental bouts. 

About a month ago, my best friend moved across the country for her work; was sad but dealing with it ok. My ex lives in the city my friend moved to and since he and I are civil after the breakup, I mentioned to him that my friend was moving and long story short; I connected them to get drinks and show my friend around so she’s not lonely. Well, they’ve started to kind of become friends, which I was still ok with - until my friend casually mentioned to me “you and *guy* make such a better pair than *other guy* he’s with now.”  

Oof. 

#painfulblow1

About two weeks after she moved I was adjusting to her being gone, I found out that one of my childhood friends I was still extremely close to from my hometown 4 hours away had died in her sleep. Oof. She was 8 years older than me, but like a sister. She battled bipolar 1 for years, as well as a host of other illnesses. Autopsy has finally shown accidental OD (alcohol and pills) as the cause. Goddammit. Shakes fist at the sky. Processing she’s gone hasn’t been like any other death I’ve experienced. It doesn’t seem real, yet the hole is large. We were therapists to each other. To add insult to injury, I attended the pink concert in town this weekend, which was one of her favorite artists. Unexpectedly, I broke down and lost it halfway through the show when “just like a pill” came on. 
#painfulblow2&amp;3

Lastly, a dweeb I dated like, 4 years ago is still Facebook friends with an elderly relative who felt the need to text me they saw a post that he got engaged. I made it clear to the relative that I surely don’t care, and politely asked them to not ever give me that information ever again. I brushed it off. But of course, my brain likes to think about it at night. 
#painfulblow4

I stayed in bed all weekend. Worked from home Monday. Now I’m trying to get myself to bed so I can be up early for the office early Tuesday morning. 

To those of you that also battle these mood swings, how do you do it? I have no hobbies. I have nothing that interests me anymore. Sure, maybe something for 10-15 minutes but then my interest is gone. How do you find those things that ignite your spark again?

The 50mg of Zoloft I’ve been on for years doesn’t seem to be doing a damn thing. But luckily I see my therapist tomorrow afternoon. 

Thanks for listening everyone.  :)";crm2019

Haven't realized it untill a friend I love dearly pointed this out saying ""how can you care about me when you don't even care about yourself"". Since then I have been living in guilt and am trying hard to change myself.

The problem is that I am never myself, honestly I don't even know who I am. All my decisions are based on how people around me will perceive. What I want is buried so deep under all these thoughts that no matter how much I dig, I couldn't find it.

I want to know who I am. People say we are who we are when no one's watching us but I am soo bored and lost when I have none of these thoughts. It's like my life is just a lie and there is nothing apart from this lie. After watching a few videos and reading a bit, I've decided to be more vulnerable. But no matter how much I try, I can never stop these thoughts.

I just can't stop getting angry over this one memory. This was a couple weeks after my diagnosis, my mom was telling me about how good I had it compared to some people and how I should just ""be happy"" because I have nothing to be sad about. I told her to stop and she kept on pushing and pushing and I broke down. 

Then, later, she's apologizing for doing it (it was pretty fucking easy to just lay off so I didn't really accept it) and I kinda shrugged it off. She then said something along the lines of, ""Let's just get you on antidepressants, I can't deal with this anymore."" She knew I was reluctant to go on them, especially before I even tried therapy or was able to fully process the diagnosis. She just kept pushing them, saying they were ""the only solution."" She just wanted the easy way out. It was the first time I had actually vented in a while, it's not like I'd been crying in front of them every other day. 

Although I'm fine now, the whole way she dealt with the situation just pisses me the fuck off. Instead of realizing that maybe, just maybe, part of it could have been her fault, she just assumed that I was some angsty teen looking for attention.";ThrowawayKeleven

199;2 years ago my best friend died and I haven't been able to be happy since;6;biytnj;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biytnj/2_years_ago_my_best_friend_died_and_i_havent_been/;0;2019-04-30 08:49:50;"Almost two years ago my best friend of 11 years passed away from having a series of epileptic seizures. I had gone through bad depression cycles before this but when this happened it just changed everything.

A little backstory about my life, I grew up homeschooled all my life so I didn't really have a lot of chances to meet new people. My friend who's name is Alec, was my only friend I had from my childhood and pretty much was my only friend until my senior year when I meet another who I became pretty close with. 

After I had graduated I only hung out with Alec twice before he passed ( we both were busy working and I had college to get ready for and my sisters wedding). When I heard he was in the hospital I wasn't to worried because it had started to become a thing that would happen every 3 months or so in the past year. But when he didn't wake up for a week I knew things were bad but I still knew he'd pull through but during my graduation party I got a call from his sister saying he was brain dead. It was the only time I have and probably will cuss my brain out in front of my entire family. 

In the following months I got dozens of messages from family and People who I barely knew growing up. Eventually my other friend I met in my senior year (who I hung out with almost every day since Alec's passing) began to really make me feel like he was using me (I had been driving him and paying for more and more things) so I stopped hanging out with him. 

The only person I had to talk to was my girlfriend, but we're a LDR couple so it makes hard ( bless that poor womans soul for staying with me as long as she has) I eventually went to school this year (a very small one at that about 1000 people). I had hoped this is where I would find lifelong friends. Everyone in my family told me this would be the best time of my life and I would meet great friends. It started out this way me and my roommate clicked super well and we hung out all the time in our new friend group of about 7 people. But he ending up leaving for no real reason last semester and our friend group fell apart and now no one really talks to anyone anymore. 

This past two years have been the loneliest time of my life with happy blips, (my first semester here at school and going to see my girlfriend) but I spend my days by myself. I try to do things with people but I can never make anything work, I just feel like either people don't enjoy hanging out with me, or that people use me since I have money (I work in school). I just don't trust people anymore and I feel like I'm not meant to find good friends, which really sucks because I'm a huge people person and I love to be with people and make people laugh.

I'm sorry for the long/sloppy post, it's my first post and there's a lot that goes into this story. If anyone has any questions I'd be happy to answer.";allstar12468

Like, not just the generic “because your funny” or “I need my friend” but like actual legit examples of ways I may have affected their life in a positive light and how much it meant to them that I did that, even if it’s like something little.

I'm alot of things. So here we go. Starting with my father. Drug addict, drunkard that used to be my only source of encouragement to the age of 13. Real PoS. Tattoo artist. I helped him move a chair last week, and he called me a worthless piece of shit that can't move shit, even though I work in a factory that moves 90 lbs bags around by hand up stairs. He always tries to encourage bad behavior of any kind. Plus, he's always dragging his girl problems around. Hasn't paid my mom child support in months, and he lives with his mom, who gives him cash to pay the child support. 

Stepfather who has mentally and verbally abused since as long as I can remember. Come.home from.school, shouting at eachother for hours for no reason. He would pin me too walls ,and tell me how worthless I am, then force his opinions on me and not let me do.what I wanted unless they fell in line with his belief/ wants. Tried cos, but they wouldn't listen. Abuses mother and little brother, but I used to fight back sk they wouldn't. Sheltered and never been to doctors till this year. 

Little brother, used to abuse me  beat me with ladles. If I retaliated, step father would beat till bleeding and bruised. Scars from where and when. Entitled prick. Cutting now that the divorce has happened. Wants to live with father but mom wont allow bc narcissistic asshole that would corrupt little brother. 

Mother. Suicidal, second divorce. I've talked out of several times. Struggle for money due to shitty hospital hours. 

House Bill's still in stepfather's name. Companies refuse to switch owners/ names, due to contract stepfather made when he created them. Some Bill's able to switch and compromise, but cannot pay for. My job barely covers it. But then we have no food or comfort. Trying to sell, working good in that department, but can't move till sell, due to money. 

Trying to kove out with Gf, and was working well until

Gf with epilepsy and scoliosis of 2 years, used to be party girl slut. Good girl now, in college and willing to settle down. Reunited with old friends, had party that turned drinking. Epilepsy + alcohol not good, leads to me being worried and scared about the party. Monitors her tk make sure she's okay. She doesn't tell me who is there how many people there. Or what was going to happen. I'm worried that she's falling into old habits. She gets pissed I don't trust her. 
We make up a few days later, and we are telling jokes, I say something that I didn't say at beginning of relationship bc it would ruin new relationship, forgot I didn't tell her about it. She gets pussdd. Looses trust. Week break. Back together, we trying to make it better. She's distant. And rarely talks. I dont see for more than 15 mins a day. Stayed the night to see endgame couple days ago. Good date. Try to have another one next day. She cancels. Day after. Try again. Cancels again. Tried today for simple massage and TV show. Says yes. 

Spends day at her party friends house bc she just got back frkm.florida. sleeps there for a while while I'm at work. (We work same farmhand job)  says she'll meet me at farm. Doesn't wake up, I call after farm saying I'm heading home. She says call when I get home. I call when home, she says she'll eat and leave. I tidy up. Dress nice, shower and clean. Hour goes by. She's still not there. (Earlier bought flowers and candy) call to make sure everything is okay. She gets pissy when I ask if she still wants to hang out. ""I said yes, I'm just catching up with old friend"" it's okay if you dknt want to, just let me know. ""Fine, I won't."" 

Call her dad to see what's wrong. He doesn't know. I drop flowers off at her place and her family greets me nicely saying she's been weird lately. 


She's my only source of happiness. And when I dknt have her, i am suicidal. I dont know what to do. My job is trying to put me in counseling bc i need it  but it's slow and hard. My only friend I have left other than gf is highschool pal. And he's struggling himself. She keeps distancing herself, and doesn't feel like she's trying. For dates, I am the k my one to try and initiate. Sexually, I dknt turn her on anymore. I am going to the gym for her tk.try and find me appealing again. We rarely text anymore. And when we do. It's always an argument. We used to always solve our fights fast. But now, it's like she wants nothing to do with me. I am in the brink of insanity, and j can feel my will to live dwindle every day. I am so lost in my own thoughts of despair that I cannot even find joy unless I'm with her. I rely on her  she says she does too, but she hasn't spoken with me about issues in months.";Jammerbanks

My struggles with depression started when I was in high school. Without going into a ton of detail, it started getting a bit better in College. I eventually broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years which was rough for the first bit, but the last 6 months or so of my life has been a really eye opening experience for me. I learned to be independent, to have more self-confidence, and I was just genuinely loving life. It's now been a year and a half since the break-up and I've learned so much about myself.

Coming into 2019, I was the most optimistic I'd ever been. I have an amazing relationship with my family, a great job for someone my age, with a salary and benefits, and I have a really solid group of friends. 

In February, I started dating my current boyfriend. At first things were good, I really felt a connection with him, I was helping him with his own battle with depression, etc.  

Very soon into our relationship, I found out I was pregnant. I'm 22, so while I was terrified at first, I actually warmed up to the idea of a baby and started to get really excited. The few people I had told were so supportive of me and I felt really good. I had just gotten a promotion as well so I knew I would be ok financially.

I told my boyfriend the day I found out. He was understandably really scared but was open to thinking about it and weighing out the pros and cons with me. He was really sweet. But the more weeks that went by, the more I could tell he wasn't taking things seriously.

He ended up telling me he really did not want a baby right now and basically blamed him spiralling back into substance abuse on the thought of me keeping the baby. I asked him to please think about it a bit longer because it had only been a couple of weeks. He did but his mind didn't change. I listened to his reasons and I genuinely understand and felt for him. 

Eventually, I ""realized"" he was right and that a baby just wasn't ideal or logical for us or me right now and I agreed to terminate the pregnancy. 

The process for me to get an appointment has been so long and frustrating. I began to get enraged at the fact that I was having such horrible morning sickness if there was no reward in the end anyways. In turn this made me begin to resent my boyfriend. It's at the point now where I can't tell if I'm making the right decision, or if he just manipulated me into making the decision he wanted.

It's to the point where I don't even want to hang out with him anymore. Everything he does irritates me or makes me mad. He just acts like terminating a pregnancy is no big deal at all and it infuriates me (yes I've tried talking to him about this many many times). 

My appointment is on Thursday. Once of my biggest anxiety triggers is decision making. I am absolutely terrified of making a wrong decision that I'll regret. The past few months, I've realized that my old boyfriend of 4 years is the love of my life.

Between all of the physical and emotional stress this pregnancy has caused me, as well as the other traumatic events that have happened to me in the last 2 years, and now realizing how much I love my ex, I just can't cope. 

I'm sorry this post was so long, I just didn't know where to turn to right now. I'm not suicidal so calling a hotline didn't seem appropriate, and therapy sessions take weeks to book. I needed to vent. 

I just don't know what to do anymore and I don't know how to make myself happy. Not only does the depression keep me in bed all day (I have to work from home because my nausea is so bad), but I've barely eaten anything in the last month due to the morning sickness so I am very weak. 

If anybody could offer some simple activities they do to keep busy other than watching YouTube and Netflix all day, that would be amazing. It makes me feel even worse lying around being lazy. 

I'm not sure what I expect to get from this post, I don't mind if it just serves as a journal entry.

209;Falling Back into Bad Habits;1;biyoua;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biyoua/falling_back_into_bad_habits/;0;2019-04-30 00:34:43;"Hey all,

So, a little background: I'm a junior in high school, turning 18 in November. I used to go to a highly prestigious academy, which I chose to leave by personal choice sometime during March (I wanna say around early-mid March). The reasons I left were the insane amount of stress I had, nobody who I could truly call a close friend, being trapped in a bubble that is the school grounds, and how alone and suicidal I've felt.  I unfortunately have gotten into the habit of smoking weed ever since last year, but it has gotten worse ever since I left. One bright side I've gotten from this leaving action, is that I now have a very serious relationship with a girl that means the world to me.

Even though I'm so incredibly happy when I'm with her in person, I miss her as soon as I leave (she does too if that helps show how attracted we are to eachother) and have been ending up in this nearly vegetative state recently. Just laying in my bed or on a couch, doing nothing for extended periods of time. I've also noticed how I have been eating either nothing or in excess (usually the former) on any given day. As far as I know, my health is in okay shape (I'm an appropriate weight and I don't have any serious physical health problems) but I feel like it may get seriously worse soon as is.

One major problem with all this is my phobia for being put on medication. It may seem weird that I'm scared of being put on drugs, as I smoke weed regularly, but something about needing to change my body chemistry just so I can function makes me feel like I'm not a proper human being. That everything about me is just wrong and needs to be changed.

I don't know what to do, and I'm scared everything will get much worse and I'll be stuck in a never ending cycle.

Then college came around and I didn’t pursue college sports since I knew I was incapable of handling sports and academics. That was the first time I lost my identity.. losing track. Then I found my identity to be science at community college. It would feel so kickass to have a chemistry degree.. however.. i’m trying. I pass everything but Spanish and General Chemistry. 

My first attempts at Spanish & Chemistry I with-drawled. Second attempts I failed completely. I have just failed Chemistry, making it an incomplete third attempt.  

I feel dumb, worthless and a burden on my step dad, who pays for my expenses. I’m 21 and I am behind and haven’t gotten my AA yet. I only need Spanish 1 & 2 to technically get it.

I’m tired of people who love me say it’s just a bump in the road.. i’m tired of the several fucking bumps. I cut out video games, reading, social activities, I don’t do drugs or get into trouble... and i still just fail.

“You should think of changing your degree”
I don’t see any value in college except for science. I love science.. I wanted to be a forensic toxicologist or maybe pathology. Pursuing science is the only identity I have left. I don’t want kids or a family so if i’m going to have a purpose, it needs to be science.

I tried so hard this semester too.. exams are 70% of our grade.. I had an amazing helpful and caring professor for once but i just let him down. 

I don’t see any reason to continue to live like livestock. No reason to stay a burden on my step dads money. No reason to accept living a mundane shitty life with a normal useless job. I want to just get rid of all my shit, quit my part time job that feeds me and make myself rot until i have no choice but to off myself.

It’s not good I know that now, I just want to get this off my chest and maybe warn other people. Because drugs and drink are the worst thing to abuse, it may make you feel better for a short while but in the long run, it’s horrible. And a big waste of money, if anyone is considering abusing substances because of something stressing them out or bringing them down I hope to god you see this post and know it’s 1. Not the end and 2. It’s not the right move. 
My advice is exercise; natural dopamines are the best and exercise gives you plenty. And also make friends and go enjoy life! Live music for me is the key to that but obviously it could be something else for someone who’s different to me. But please just don’t abuse substance because of depression.

So the last few days I've made a real effort to be in contact, tell him what was going on with me, ask about his day and how he was, and try to make plans to get together. His text replies were short and curt and few and far between,  he didn't answer my phone call when i attempted to talk to him rather then text. Finally he replied with ""you're sending too many texts and annoying me. Stop being so needy"". I was crushed.   


Now I don't know what to do or how to act. I feel shame, I'm embarrassed and second guessing everything I do. I feel like a nuisance when I try to do better, and I get criticized when I isolate (which I mainly do out of fear of being too needy).

I got into college in social sciences. I had no clue what I wanted to do, I just went with the flow. Many (extremely) bad things happened during the first semester and I just couldn't act like a normal human anymore.

Two weeks ago, I had this weird flash. I have always liked computers, video games, creating things etc. I talked to my father about it. The result? I will transfert to a new city in August, start studying a new program (completely different from what I am doing now). So many times I was on the verge of leaving this world, and yet, here I am, so grateful I didn't. Because I finally have an opportunity that gives me hope. I have a new beginning, a new life waiting for me. 

Please, if you are reading this and thinking of ending it all: 
You are amazing to be as strong as you are. You don't believe me? I know what you have and are still going through is awful. And yet, here you are, still fighting. Every breath you take is proof of your strength.

Since i was a kid i’ve always struggled making friends or keeping friends. I’ve always thought that i’m the reason why, like maybe i’m not a good friend or boring and not interesting in the slightest. Any person i tell always says the same ‘its not you its them’ and then they disappear. The worst point was last october when i nearly lost my mum, she had a heart issue and was 30 minutes from death. I had no one to talk to throughout this period and don’t have the greatest relationship with my siblings so i was basically dealing with this on my own (brother and sister never offered for me to go up with them but instead left me with my dad who they disowned. I basically feel like i’m just there, another person in the background or the kid in the corner at school that everybody ignores. I’m now 26 years old and it still bothers me to this day.

I was bullied through school and college, name calling, pushed around, one guy even choked me from behind so i find it difficult to trust people. This has left me feel anxious alot and insanely shy and nervous with new people, i’m sure that won’t help but it affected me massively and as much as i try i can’t get over it. Sometimes i sit there and think what is the point anymore.

Anyway if you read this thanks for reading, i just felt the need to get this off my chest and didn’t know what to do.

If not, I'll check this post again in a few hour. 

Quick back story, I've feel sadness for years. Last year I had a mental break down and got brought to a psychiatrist. Since then I've been diagnosed with MDD and anxiety disorder. I've been analyzed for bipolar disorder and I rarely have ""ups"" so that was ruled out. I've been on several medications the last being Lexapro and quetiapine for about 4 months which worked great for me except I was always always always tired. The Lexapro finished around three weeks ago and I just recently had the chance to go back to the psychiatrist. During these three weeks I've been feeling absolutely horrible, physically and mentally. After speaking, she decided I should try something new and prescribed Wellbutrin and Lexotan. I've only taken Lexotan tonight and less than half an hour ago.

Anyway tomorrow is my birthday and yearly around this time of the year I wonder how I've even made it another year in this state. This year is different, I've made it because of medication but overall the motivation to live is minimal. Up until yesterday however, I felt indifferent to this and considered it a regular birthday ritual even planning things I can do to get through the next week. Well....a few minutes ago I felt suddenly dizzy, the room got blurry for a few seconds then strong urge to die came over me. Literally felt like a suicidal wave collapsed on my head and I've been fighting years since then . Before this, nothing but brain zaps and relative indifference. Now, I'd strongly like to die. I haven't been suicidal in months and even then it felt like a floating thought and not a urge or desire. Has anyone else felt like this? What did you do? What should I do? Is this a withdrawal effect?";rainee14
256;Need Help: 25 years old and never achieved anything. How to go about it without knowing?;1;bixv88;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bixv88/need_help_25_years_old_and_never_achieved/;1;2019-04-29 23:06:51;"**I am sorry for the TLDR post. My situation is a bit complicated, I tried not to drag on too long. If you read this, you would be helping me out so much. I really do appreciate any of you on here who read this.**

&#x200B;

All I want is to live life. Have a life. That means some sort of job that I actually enjoy, maybe a significant other, independence etc. The problem is not that I *don't* want to get out there and live life, it's that I do not know what to do, or where to start. There are so many paths you can take in life. Being indecisive, and having OCD, on top of the depression doesn't help I guess.

&#x200B;

 I just sit home all day and play games, I really hate it. I don't enjoy this life, I hate it so, so much. So I question myself, what can I do? What the hell can I possibly do? I would do anything, just to know and get me the hell out of this house. I am SO sick of depending on my parents, being a man child. I hate it, yet I am the one who's at fault. It's completely my fault that I am in this situation, and I'm clearly my own worst enemy.

&#x200B;

So, how to go about it? How to know what path I should take? Well, it's a bit complicated for me. I am at the lowest I have ever been in life. What really set me off the rails was my county college screwing me over this spring. Here is where I blame the school entirely. I am a chemistry major, I finished 2 chem classes there, but I needed to go to a 4 year university with a real lab program, because the one at county was almost non existent.

&#x200B;

I paid my transcript fee in advance and called the college I applied to several times, the transcript was never sent, even after xmas break. This left me with NO spring semester, because my school failed to send the transcript over to the 4 year uni, even after I hounded them for it over the phone and they assured me it would be sent....

&#x200B;

 College was the one scrap in my life that made me feel worthy, and being 25 years old with at least another 3 years of school left does not feel good at all, especially now that it's postponed a full semester.

&#x200B;

Now I'm left with summer classes... but realistically I would never want to take org chem in the summer. This school not sending over the transcript really made me fall back into my hole. I question if I even want to go to college now. 

&#x200B;

When I think of college and finishing a chem degree, a get this sick feeling in my stomach. Deep down, I really don't think I will be happy going to college until I'm at least 30. It's also extremely stressful and complicated to be a chemistry major. I don't think I have the discipline or love in the right place. College just makes me more depressed, yet the work world seems even worse. Trust me, I'd be willing to be a hard working college student, but the fact that I'm 25 and have barely even put my  toe into the world of chemistry... is very, very discouraging. 

&#x200B;

 I'd rather not switch majors either, I took 2 chem classes already.. it'll feel wasted. Plus, I don't think anything will grasp me as much as science. 

&#x200B;

It's just so tough. I think a lot about my childhood and the way I thought about my future. I never thought I'd end up like this, at 25. It's a nightmare turned into reality. I am nothing and achieved nothing. 

&#x200B;

I day dream sometimes now, just imagining ""living life"". That is, having a simple job, having a small simple apartment far, far away from where I live now. On my own, independent. Even if I had a new name, just a completely new life. I'd die just to go back to highschool. I wasted away so much, and I feel it's too late. 

&#x200B;

In terms of jobs, I have little to no experience. I only had 1 job, which was phone solicitation. I was 19 at the time. The main reason I never had a job really is because of my extreme anxiety towards the job world. I am not the most stable person, and the recent changes they have made in retail make everything worse.

&#x200B;

For example, if I was a best buy employee, or worked at Journey's- I see employees are now forced to lie and try to sell extra shit to customers. I am the last person on the planet who would ever do that. My OCD covers lying. I cannot lie to a customer, even if it's a random person. I'm not full of shit, so I can't just ""get a job"" when a job goes against everything I stand for and feel.

&#x200B;

But, now I am so, so conflicted. Conflicted so much, it's crippling. The thought of college makes me want to die. The thought of getting a simple job makes me feel a bit better... but who the hell would hire me at this point? I mine as well put I never had a job. I have applied at many places in the past, they never respond. I've had interviews, they never hired. It just gets me angry.

&#x200B;

If they look that I am a 25 year old who has been unemployed for 6 years, why the hell would they hire me? And I don't blame them. But maybe after the dozens of applications I did when I was in my early 20s.. one of those corporate scumbags could have at least gave me a chance.

&#x200B;

So, yeah. There's my situation. I have no where else to go besides here. I appreciate it so much if you read this whole thing. I tried to condense it as much as I can.. - but ANY ADVICE about ANYTHING is so, so much appreciated. I just don't know what to do and it's slowly eating me alive. I hate this life and all I want is to just be somewhat happy.

&#x200B;

Thank you";Forevershadow1

I know I’ve accomplished things but I feel the weight of my past and the expectations of my future from myself and family is sometimes too much to bare.

261;What I learned after 6 years of depression;61;bixr1y;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bixr1y/what_i_learned_after_6_years_of_depression/;6;2019-04-29 22:55:12;"* **There is no ""if i just had... <>, id be happy""**. I thought if i moved out of my parents house, i wouldn't be depressed. I thought if I had a girlfriend, I wouldn't be depressed. I thought if I had my dream job, I wouldn't be depressed. Turns out after achieving or having all those things, it only made a temporary difference. 3 months max. Depression will always come back as its apart of you and who you are.
* **Its best to be open about it.** I hid my depression for 4 years, it drained me and it was fucking lonely. Being open about it to your hopefully existing friends takes a huge weight off you not having to be someone your not. Now im surrounded with friends that have similarities to me, We once stood up at night just crying to each other because of the  stuff that we were going through - i didn't feel so lonely.  ""*Being someone else drains you, being yourself replenishes you naturally*""
* **Do the little things that can help.** Unfolllow your ex on instagram, delete his/her number or photos. (unpopular opinion) stop closely following r/depression. Get rid of the things in your life that can give you a reason and remind you to be sad.
* **Depression sucks, anxiety is much worse**. They tend to go hand in hand like brother and sister. If you got both, there is help for anxiety. Try some of the over-prescribed medication out there. Ive been on some for about 5-6 months now and the amount ive achieved because of it contrasts me from being a kid to a successful adult. 
* **Im proud and thankful for my depression.** Yes I cry alot, and for no reason sometimes. Yes I dont want to get out of bed some days. Yes I get massively unmotivated to do anything but stare at my ceiling. But all that has made the person I am today. Im caring, empathetic, and I have the power to see right people and see there current emotion by a 2 second glance. Im fucking <insert name here> and **as long as im alive im winning the fight against depression.**";tyrannosaurusRect

I’ve been ignored a countless number of times. All I do is try to make others happy and I actually do succeed. But nobody cares about me ya know? I feel so lonely.

I have no interests these days. I go to work, and when I come home, I do nothing. I make food since its required for survival. I go to my room, and I browse youtube videos or reddit until its an acceptable time to go to bed.

Ill try to find plans with a friend cuz at least then ill be social and do something with my time, but most are in relationships, getting married, having kids, etc. Theyre busy and that's okay! I would be too. But if I don't find someone to spend time with, then I sit in my room and try to distract myself so I don't cry over how lonely/bored/sad/mad I am that day.

People are starting to notice. My boss asks me if im okay every day because im quieter than usual. I don't even know when this started. Its just crept up slowly over time and it gets worse every day. Every day I feel less like doing anything or spending time with people. I just want to sleep. Not because im tired, but because I have nothing better to do. I used to have hobbies. I used to go to the gym at least 3x a week. I did yoga. I went out and practiced my photography. I played video games. I had shows I loved on Netflix for those cold or rainy days. I loved to read, I loved it so so much.

Now none of those things interest me. I need to get to the gym because it will release endorphins and ill feel better. But I cant get there. I cant find a book that holds my attention. I tried to get out and take some photos and nothing inspired me. Theres nothing id rather do less than watch Netflix or play a video game.

I don't know what to do anymore. Im so tired of feeling like this. I don't know where I went. I was doing really well and I had a good handle on everything. I was starting to enjoy life again after so much struggle. And then its like I ran into a wall and it all went away. I thought it was just a phase, or that it would pass, as it usually does.

But it hasn't. I still feel hopeless? bored? numb? I don't know the right word to describe it. but I hate it. its like the me I used to be is trapped in this mind of someone  don't even know. Is this depressed? I don't know anymore. Maybe this is just who I am now. This is the person im going to be?

None of this makes sense and I so desperately want to call my best friend and tell him everything. I want someone to hug me and help me.

It's been a few months since this conversation and I've been doing ok mentally, until this past week.

I've lost almost 40 pounds since the year started, from 252.8 to 214.2. I'm getting taller too, so I don't look horribly unproportionate or round. I intermittent fast and work out every day, my grades have been going up, people love me, they tell me that I seem so much happier lately. But I can't for the life of me understand how.

The way I've been feeling isn't the regular sadness I feel when my depression gets bad, I can easily carry this charismatic facade. But I feel so... empty, disconnected like I'm sinking into nothing. 

Every day is the same, wake up at 6, showered and at school by 7:15, walk through the day, I'm the smartest kid in my grade so the work isn't really a challenge (which is an arrogant thing to say, but I go to a pretty shit public school so it's not too hard) , I interact with my friends that I feel so lucky to have, then (hopefully) hit the gym, then home, Youtube videos, Netflix (BoJack Horseman currently), turning on my speaker and listening to Frank Ocean until fall asleep. Video games don't interest me anymore, I play for my high school's League of Legends team, but I hate it, I can't wait to quit as soon as another player can take my place. I used to skateboard so much, but now I just goto the park alone. 

I can't even bring myself to read anymore, I'm an extremely avid reader but I just spent two weeks reading a 168-page book, for context, I used to read ~200 pages a day (for that size of book, a book with larger dimensions  like Infinite Jest or some complicated philosophical work like Kant or Hegel might slow me to a screeching ~50 pages a day).

The only thing keeping me sane is these shitty poems I write all day. I'm a very stoic person, notorious for my lack of emotional reaction (if only they knew... lol), so my peers and friends usually find it surprising that I'm writing poetry. 

I think the most lonely feeling is how I can't find anyone else that feels this way, I ask sometimes, these leading questions to see if anyone else understands how I feel. No one ever understands.

Another strange thing, usually my depression has a reason, something shallow and fleeting, a crush not liking me back. Sometimes I fall into these deep pits where I miss my older brother that passed away in 2016. But now I just... don't feel, at all, anything.

It climbed into my vehicle at a stop light, uninvited.  My back seat is full of his baggage, which appears to multiply by the minute. Where did all this come from? Some of the bags have labels. Like ""tired"", ""hopeless"", and ""suicide"". The biggest bag is empty. I don't know what belongs in it. Maybe some day I'll find out.

I'm afraid to ask his name. And I've no idea where we're going. Maybe one of these bags has a map or instructions.

I put on a fake smile and politely ask him to leave. I think happy thoughts and put on music like I was taught. But there it stays in the passenger seat. The magic pills I swallow daily promise to make my hitchhiker disappear. But they only make him sit a little lower in his seat. 

At some point depression's friend anxiety joins the road trip. Bouncing all over the back seat like a little kid hopped up on sugar. Making my nerves feel raw. I'm exhausted, ready for this road trip to end. But my vehicle has no brakes. 

I take one wrong turn after another. Hitting every pot hole in the road. I swerve to miss a mangy dog and a bag labeled ""emotions"" spills it's contents on the floor. Stray pieces roll under my seat settling against my feet. When I try to kick them away, they stick to me like someone's old gum.

Occasionally my hitchhiker dozes quietly. I'm finally able to relax. I notice the sun shining on green fields of sweet clover along the smoothly paved road. A young calf happily frolics around his mother eating in the field. Is this what happiness feels like? 

Suddenly I hit a bump in the road. My hitchhiker startles awake with a scream. His arms flailing, hitting me and the door. I flinch and shrink against the door, crying uncontrollably. Wishing there was something to hide under. But there never is. Because you can't hide from depression.

(On mobile pardon the typing)
Growing up I was diagnosed with adhd and saw a therapist regularly but she was not able to help me control my anger or I couldn't control it.
I'm currently in my late 20s, when I was in middle School and part of high school I severely struggled controlling my temper and anger issues. It was bad, if it was for the adults around me in the private school I went to that knew my true character, I wouldn't have made it to graduation. For perspective, one outburst of mine sent a peer to the hospital for a few weeks. He was my bully for 2 years (6th and 7th grade), (I had the anger problem before he arrived) he chucked a basketball at my head and broke my glasses and my reaction was to pick up the nearest object and Chuck it back at him which evidently was a good fist sized piece of concrete (the walkway we were on was falling apart in that section near the playground) and it hit him in the head and caused some fairly significant trauma. His parents moved after that. It wasn't until my sophomore year in high school that I began to control my anger. After that everything was great, I never had any more outbursts, I felt feel and calm and felt that way for a long time. Between age 17 and 26 I only had 3 outbursts compared to my younger years where I could have 3 in a day.

With all of that progress I am just frustrated at my current situation. I feel utterly out of control. It was not a gradual thing, I literally woke up one morning last month and had so much random undirected rage I could barely contain myself. I work in the customer service industry and normally no one tries my patience but since that morning every little thing sets me off and I have to do everything to make sure customers don't see it. It was something just flicked a switch in my brain and all my self control disappeared. What the fuck happened to me? Everything everyone says to me annoys me, everything that happens angers me, idk where this anger came from or how to stop it. I want to not be angry and idk how.";spart0n654

My birthday is coming up and for the first time ever, I legitimately considered committing suicide on that day. I've been having chronic suicidal thoughts for a very long time now and they've progressively gotten worse. It went from imagining scenarios as I walked past certain landmarks, to pointing a finger gun to my head and firing a trigger. I had always said that I would never do it because people love me, but the possibility has become more and more....attractive for lack of better words.

&#x200B;

I binge eat, often. I recently started working out most days of the week to shake off the depression, but when I'm done, I still sink back. When I'm home alone, I do nothing but eat myself beyond full and watch pornography. Anything to numb the pain. I used to have a lot of sex to numb it, but have successfully not been doing that for a few years now.

&#x200B;

Over the last few years, all my immediate family members had multiple mental health breakdowns and it feels like our family has completely fallen apart. I also have been struggling with my sexuality for a very long time. I hold a Christian worldview, and so homosexuality will never be my goal. Resisting it has put me in a lot of turmoil.

I was supposed to see my therapist today and he stood me up.

Lately, I've been plagued by frequent bizarre nightmares involving ambiguous deadly threats chasing me, seeking me or hunting me. I even wake up screaming in sheer terror sometimes, when my nightmare is vivid enough. 

Last night didn't involve me waking up screaming, but it did involve me being chased by a blemish, dirty looking, monster of a woman straight out of a horror movie and a few other more ambiguous entities that led me to flee the area by car and eventually crashing.

Other nightmares I've had involved deadly pandemics, being quarantined, cannibals, zombies, being a fugitive, being jailed, being drafted in the military, horrifying creatures, being stuck in high school, being confined to a particular building by ambiguous institutions, unsuccessful attempts at escaping confinement, hiding from threats, fleeing threats, being chased by threats, being punished in some way for reasons ambiguous, etc...

I am now 30 years old and have been suffering from an axiety disorder, panic attacks and depression(dysthymia) since I was 17 years old. I grew up in a emotionale and physically abusive enviroment. Lost my best friend 7 years ago to an illness.

My mental state went up and down for some while, had some pretty bad points where I started to plan my suicide. Wrote goodbye letters and so on.

It took shitloads of work, a severe double depression, 5 years of medication, a bad discontinuation syndrome, some time at a day clinic, further therapy etc. to get to the happy side of life again and also being able to work with my dysthymia, which can be quite a bitch tbh.

After that I got much better, found a new job that I really blossomed at (I have been studying or working the entire time although I felt shit every day, been only off work whilst therapy at the clinic and a short time after).

I could cope with all ups and downs life threw towards me after the clinic. 

But the good run ended after 2 years. When my dearest sister died...5 months after being diagnosed with a super rare cancer...it’s only been a little over two weeks since she died, but I feel there is this massive black hole trying to suck me back in and I don‘t feel like fighting right now and it doesn’t only feel like grief, but I‘m not sure.

I don‘t know if this is due to the fact that I was taking care of her in her last phase of life and now I don‘t feel like having a purpose anymore or this shatters me so deeply I just want to curl up and stop existing, because I can‘t cope with the pain.

EDIT: I can't sleep, so I'm gonna write more...

I even begged my mother to end my life when I was no older than 11. 

I used to think about the easiest, most painless ways to end my life when I was younger

Now about that girl I mentioned: We went to the same class from 2012 to 2016. I was a crappy person back then (already mentioned it in the text before EDIT), but she and one of my friends (who I had known before we learned to walk) seemed to ignore my crappy behaviour. Me and this dude were (and still are) best friends and did everything together, but me and her were not that good friends. We used to talk from time to time, but not for very long. Few words, a joke here and there and that was pretty much it. But I felt comfortable (I usually hate talking to people, idk why, but I just hate it) when we had those small conversation. Last time when I saw her was 2 years ago. I had a girlfriend in meanwhile, which was way more attractive, both physically and psychically than the girl I'm talking about, but it wasn't the same connection. Sure, I fell in love with that other girl, but it seemed kida meaningless... I don't see her (the girl this whole part is about) as a ""girlfriend material"" or something like that... It's kinda weird... I feel like she's something more, a part of me that's missing. I noticed that I'm missing her when we finished elementary and went to different schools. I knew what was her opinion about me (even tho she acted kinda nice to me) and I knew we couldn't be friends (anymore?). The reason why I didn't commit suicide was hope that she might not actually dislike me. Last time we spoke to eachother was 2 years ago at a party (it was a younger generation's goodbye-party  we were both invited to). I knew it was gonna be the last time and I was devastated. She noticed that I'm not having fun and tried to take me for a dance. I almost started crying so I told her I'm kinda drunk and that I'd rather sit there and talk. We talked a bit and then she went to get me another drink. She came back few times, but nothing really happened (only me wanting to cry even more)... I wrote a text (a poem? could say) when I got home. I was drunk and I cried. A day later (when I was sober), I read that text and found it cringey, but also very true. I thought about sending her that text, but I sent it to my best friend first to tell what he thinks about it. He didn't know I wrote that (forgot to mention that the text was in English, and English isn't the language we speak here) and he said it teared him up. I was in a dilemma, but I did it. She replied with something like this: ""[my name], did you cut yourself?"" (in our language, of course). That was the last thing we did - a cringey poem and a cold reply. I often read her reply. I even tried texting her, but realized it was a bad idea and that she won't be happy. My best friend texted her (even when I told him not to do that, but he just wanted to make me feel better). He tried to convince her to text me and to give me a chance. She said that I should text her first if I need her. Then he said stuff like ""He feels dead without you"" and ""He needs you to feel like a person"" (because I told him crap like that, thinking he won't tell anyone). She got kinda mad and told him it's not her fault (and I completely agree with her - I'd do the same). He screenshoted their conversation and sent it to me. I still keep those screenshots. I thought we (she and I) won't have a chance to meet again, but I was wrong. I didn't think about the fact that we live about 7-8 km apart and that we're from a small place that's not very crowded. I avoided going to some events I was sure she will go to. I often imagine that we'll be together and do stuff together. I also wrote a lot of texts and poems since then (about 140 text documents are in my archive) and I sent some to my best friend to get his opinion. I saw her in the mall few months ago (around Christmas) and it was the only time I saw her since that party. She didn't notice me (I think so). 

I want to talk to her, but I'm afraid it will disturb her. So I just try to stay alive (because of my friends and family) and think about her from time to time...

I might keep writing later. Also, thanks for reading :)";weird_BOII

319;Abuse.;6;biwdpv;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biwdpv/abuse/;2;2019-04-30 04:36:18;"*Abuse.* 

I never thought, when I talked about my past relationship, this word could be used. 

Until I heard it. 

And I was so angry at him, and at myself

Not only because of what he did to me

But how I let myself put up with that for three long years and I didn’t leave. 

。

I never forgot the endless nights of tears and panic, when he ignored my text messages for hours 

And when I said something about it, he blamed me for being insecure. 

He said he was just gaming 

He said it was no big deal 

Then there he goes again 

Despite knowing his negligence caused a turmoil of self-hatred and even harming. 

。

He never said “I love you” first, nor did he ever initiate a date 

Instead, every single time we meet he was always late

No, he never apologized, unless being forced

But next time, you bet, he’d do it all again, without remorse.  

。

I forced myself to ignore the lack of attention in his eyes

I made myself hide away when I cried 

I wrote him too many notes and letters 

Saying, for him, I’d try to be better

I loved him, more than anything

Spent pay checks after pay checks getting him his new favourite thing 

He’d say thank you

 – once in a while – 

When he doesn’t “forget to” he might give me a smile 

But that’s it, I guess, that’s what I was worth 

In his priority list, I was never the first

。

We finally broke up, but he asked me to stay

And he asked to meet every week on Thursdays 

I loved him still, of course I’d agree 

And before I could react, he started kissing me 

Then he started touching me

。 

Then it happened

。

He stripped away my innocence

I did say yes to it, in exchange for his desire for a moment 

I begged for intimacy; I begged for affection 

That I actually did it to feel important. 

He would then ask me, whether I enjoyed it

Of course, I did 

It was the only time I felt wanted. 

。

And still I blamed myself, for everything he would do or say 

It must’ve been something wrong with me – I didn’t know any other way – 

Not good enough, not cute enough, not smart enough, not calm enough 

Too attached, too insecure, too emotional, too tough 

When he lied, it was because I had a fragile heart 

When he cheated, it was because I was too emotionally attached on my part. 

。

I don’t understand, how I always let him have his way 

I was always on standby

In case nothing comes up, and he had nothing better planned for the day

He never confirmed when and where would we meet beforehand, 

He’d just leave me hanging all the time 

And that was why other plans were put on hold

Then he said I should’ve just gone out with friends of mine

I was overly attached and that caused his withdrawal, so I was told

But I was his girlfriend, I thought I was on his priority list…  

Or perhaps I wasn’t, I’m no longer sure

Cos apparently to his best friends and family, 

I wasn’t in the picture. 

。

And still, I said I was okay, don’t worry about me 

I said, hey, perhaps you tried your best 

So just let it go and let it be

I just wanted you to be happy

。

Until I realized

All the lies

All the times I’ve been taken advantage of and used 

And the *abuse*. 

。

I guess, all this time, I forgot that the thing with “abuse” 

Is that it doesn’t always come in bruises 

Sometimes it messes up your mind, your soul, your heart 

And they convince you everything was your fault

And no matter how many people told you they’ve had it worse 

He still did it to me, and that’s not what I deserve.

The convo then turned to be about one incident where I was about to have an anxiety attack due to a presentation and I asked my teacher if I could do it another day and he said I could do it after class. Afew classmates didn't like that and started attacking since that day. I really don't like that and reached the point where I cry a bit everyday.

He's the type of guy who is extremely rude when is tired and he then said ""This is fucking why everyone avoids you. Everyone has fucking fears but youre just asking for it"" (this is a rough translation).

I cant even describe stuff here because they're such weird symptoms. I've found my anxiety affects me so physically more than mentally but after this long I am so depressed  

I'm embarrassed beyond measure at how weak I feel. That if I were a better person i would dig deeper and fight against the spinning stars to stay concious instead of reach out for a chair. I used to be competent and stubborn....physically active and strong. Lost weight and turned into a soft limp noodle that can barely breath through exertion. Tired of giving myself a break ""it will get better, stop berating yourself right now""
When you start doubting yourself and only see a weak useless person. 

I think it started when my husband decided he needed to leave. I hid away all my pain and certainty I couldnt live without him. So determined to make a life on my own. I was okay if silently heartbroken. 8 years on I still think everyday I should have fought harder and I can only be happy with the love of my life with me.

This ""cycle"", makes me anxious, and I end up doing the same. I can't seem to stop. 

In theory, I understand what I need to do:
I need to take my medication, go to therapy, eat healthy and actually work properly at my job to get out. I know it's not going to change in a day, it's going to take a few months, if not years to get everything better.

I went in thinking I’d gained a lot of muscle from gym that I’d been going to, so I was fairly confident about seeing them. This confidence was broken after seeing the one guy my age (17/18yr) who had a much better body than me. I’ve had quite a strong crush on his sister, (16yr) for quite some time. It’s troubled me for so long since she’s like an inch taller than me and I don’t really have too much to talk about when I see her.

I repeated the year at my school based on my own decision (because my grades weren’t great). Since then, I’ve sorted myself out a bit. I’ve cut down my weed usage; I’ve started going to gym more often; started getting better grades. Only one thing. I never talk to girls. As for right now, there’s not one girl I talk to like regularly. I just walk past them at school, knowing deep down that they probably want me to talk to them. But I don’t, because I’m scared that I don’t have anything ‘good’ to say.

18, never had a girlfriend, only kissed a girl via a truth or dare game (so no romantic experiences). I just looked in the mirror a few minutes ago to see a mountain range of acne on my face. I’m not confident about my hair so I always wear a cap; I hate how big my nose is, basically I’m not at all happy with my facial appearance at the moment. I really want to be with this girl or at least do something with her, but I’m a coward.

I can’t sit down and study enough, so I’m afraid I won’t get the grades so hoped for at the beginning of the year. I’m a short shit. The only qualities I have is intelligence (which will mean nothing if I get bad grades), and I ay guitar quite well.

I can’t sleep tonight, I’m just sitting typing this in the dark at 2am. Can someone please give me some advice or encouragement? I’d really appreciate it.

Thank you.";ChrisishereO2

I can't lose weight no matter how much I try or how hard I try. lack of money makes it hard to eat right plus hormones messed up. don't get paid till the 3rd and have one pack of chicken left one cup of rice left and no money and will have to go the rest this week without food. 

trying to keep my room mate and her 35 year old lazy son fed on 200 a month is difficult as hell on 200 a month for the entire month.  

So tired of having no one to talk too about anything, every time I put myself out there all I get is ghosted, abandoned, dropped as if I had the plague. Women won't give me the time of day because of my weight and they all spew the same lines saying I am a great guy, I seem like a decent man, they all want the same stuff in a relationship but as soon as they see my pics and see my weight they bail and run. they don't even get a chance to see the pic of me at a gym or after I walked 6 miles or hear that I have issues with my hormones and lipten levels and such causing my weight issues and making it hard to lose. I just get told I am disgusting, ugly, worthless, should be ashamed of myself etc after they find out and after they spew the same stuff saying I was a great guy and any woman would be lucky to have me etc.

I am so tired of having no one in my life who actually gives a crap and will actually stay longer than a week. I thought I found someone as a friend but after a week they stopped contacting me for no reason at all. I have gotten to the point I have severe abandonment issues from everyone leaving all the time and ghosting me and being abandoned after they get me to the point I actually start caring after having great conversations after a few days or a week. and now starting to have severe trust issues. 

I also guarantee that if anyone comments on here saying they care, they are there for me it is all bs. they will talk for an hour or a day or two then be gone, or not even reply at all.

I don't even have rental history, no personal references, can't even get a co signer or even references for rental furniture places just to say they know me. that is so f*cking sad.

I wake up at 5:10ish lay in bed for 50 mins, trying to find the motivation to get up and not fall back to sleep, i eventually do get up and go to the bathroom, I have to pass the kitchen to get to the bathroom, my mom was in the kitchen and she says to me ""Que buena vida"" and for those who don't speak Spanish that translate to ""What a good life."" She says this sarcastically, she thinks I just spent the last 3 hours napping peacefully when in reality I was trying to hide from my demons. I was trying to get away from this thing she gave me, this thing I didn't ask for, this thing others say I should be grateful to have, this thing people call a life. I just wanted to get away from it and forget about it. I ignored her, but what she said really got to me, I got into the bathroom and was barely able to keep my self from bursting into tears. I taught to myself ""What a good life"", A life where suicide is constantly on my mind, A life where I have to mutilate my skin just to feel somewhat decent, A life I have spent with no friends, A life in where I can't be myself. A life where I looked at as weird and even to some as the spawn of Satan just because of my sexual preference. What a life where I have to be abused by you on the daily. You think you're some kind of saint. A saint would have noticed the things i'm going through, a saint would have listened to me when I said that I don't like it when you scream at me and insult me. A saint wouldn't get drunk and release your anger on me. Instead you continue to abuse me and get upset when I'm not myself and I don't want to talk to you.

336;My mom asked my therapist about beginning ketamine for my brother’s mental health issues, and has no idea my therapist and I have been discussing it for myself since January;1;bivz5x;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bivz5x/my_mom_asked_my_therapist_about_beginning/;0;2019-04-30 03:57:03;"First time poster. I really just want to put this out into the world even if nobody has an answer because the whole situation has been weighing on me since my Thursday session.

I (22 F) have been going to therapy for roughly three years. At the beginning of sophomore year of college in a city over 500 miles away from my home, I had come unglued to the point of not being able to hide my problems anymore. Bottling them up was a prerogative growing up, as my brother (24 M) suffers from severe mental health issues which tested my family. I wanted to do everything right so my parents would be less burdened and not have to worry about me while they did damage control on my brother throughout middle and high school. My therapist has later commented about how when she first saw me just how thin and frail I looked.

To keep this short, years of two different SSRIs which have both proven so far to be ineffective, highs and lows, I have considered ketamine. My therapist has encouraged it and I plan to discuss it with my psychiatrist in a few short weeks. 

At my last therapy session, I was having a difficult time and my therapist at one point says to me she wants to tell me something. My mom had sent her an email a couple weeks back asking for advice for my brother because they were considering ketamine as his newest potential treatment. My brother has been through many more medications and treatments than I have—I couldn’t say how many. We have hardly had a relationship for 8 or so years.

This upset me immensely. I immediately broke down in tears and was unable to speak for awhile. But it’s a little difficult to figure out why. My therapist and I discussed how I felt unseen and neglected by my parents when it seems to be turning out that our problems may have the same severity/solution, but I was much more functional, stereotypically “successful”, and good at covering it all up. And this makes sense. But it’s still weighing so deeply and it feels like so much more than that. By the end of the session, she thought I looked like I needed to be hospitalized and asked if I was suicidal. I said I kind of was but I would not go to the hospital. I went home and I am going back to therapy tomorrow since my therapist wanted to see me sooner rather than later.

I know this was sort of all over the place, but I’m just happy to have a platform so I can feel more “seen”. I have no idea if this is even relatable to anyone. I’m just feeling this one hard and I can’t discern why; the feelings about it are so muddled.

Hopefully therapy tomorrow helps.";tzoumtzoum
337;It doesn't always get better, but don't let that stop you from learning to cope;2;bivz4v;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bivz4v/it_doesnt_always_get_better_but_dont_let_that/;0;2019-04-30 03:56:58;"Tl;dr: For me, it stopped being about getting rid of depression and anxiety, but how I cope with it. The rest is a personal anecdote... 

I've had suicidal thoughts ever since I could remember. First vivid memory of suicide is from when I was 4. I would stare at the rope that opens and closes curtains and think about hanging myself. 

Been through a lot over the years (self harm, multiple attempts, failing University, dropping out, workplace discrimination, shitty doctors, being on wrong antidepressant for too long, too high dosage, which ended up giving me chronic sleep disorders, etc). I sought help in many different ways - individual therapies, group therapies, mindfulness practices. Along the journey I've met people that made my conditions worse, and people that made it better. In some cases, I would have never met those that supported me if I had never met those that hindered my progress. 

It took a decade to get to where I am. It was hard. Therapies are not effective if the patient doesn't put in the work (or not compatible with therapist). I had to keep trying different things, while just wanting to end it all. I have stopped treatments out of despair various times. I was able to drag myself back time and time again. I'm not sure what kept me going. It may have been that one skill group leader who told us the Buddhist saying, ""Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional."" Or, the psychologist who told me of her own struggles in post-secondary education. Or, the sleep specialist doctor (also trained in psychiatric medicine) who actually listens to my health concerns and works with me. Or, maybe it was Dr. Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"". 

I'm in my late 20's. My life is far from perfect. I'm still without a degree (being Asian, that is frowned upon). My mood is not always stable. My almost 4 year relationship is difficult to maintain and my SO struggles with alcoholism. I still live with suicidal thoughts and battle urges to self harm. But, I've learned to cope with my demons. It has been 3 years since I last lapse in cutting. I no longer drink or put myself in danger in order to feel ""better"". To be honest, I don't think the demoms will ever go away for me. They're always there, lurking, hungry for my sanity. Because I have the skills to control the beasts now, for once in my life, I feel like I may be on track to get my life together. 

If you made it this far down my post, thank you for reading. I wish everyone here best of luck in finding the courage to move forward.";cantthinkofaname099

MRI confirmed an L5/S1 disc bulge. For 2 years I struggled with mainly just Sciatic pain, but the most pain came from horrible depression and drug addiction because I couldn't do anything with my life. Through intense PT and chiropractic care I slowly recovered. Well I managed to enjoy about a year and a half pain free, got 9 months clean, and a second MRI confirmed the disc had healed and moved back into place. I had some relapse but I'm 3 months clean. Pain frew until yesterday. The all too familiar, painful ""pop"" when I went to pick up a heavy dresser. At first, the pain was somewhat tolerable. I didn't think I had done anything serious. Perhaps just a sprain/strain of the muscle(s). Overexertion. I had done just that a handful of times since my initial injury and recovered in 2 or 3 days. Well after 5 minutes it became hard to walk, then I couldn't get up stairs, then I could barely stand. Now I cant get up. I cant twist. Cant bend AT ALL. And I literally cannot pick up or carry any weight. An xray today confirms that L5/S1 is bulging again. This time I dont have as much Sciaitica. It's mainly my low back. I can barely get up from a sitting or laying down position. The low back pain is much worse, and more severe than the Sciatica from my initial injury 4 years ago. I guess I'm asking for help, advice. I'm so tired of dealing with this. My life has been at a stand still for 4 years now because I cant work. Even when I was healed I had to quit my EMT job because I just was not strong enough to lift even the lightest of patients. My dream has always been to be a Firefighter and i was training/preparing for a physical test this weekend that if passed I would have been accepted to the local city FD. Now, I've watched yet another dream get shattered to pieces. The physical pain is bad yeah, but the emotional pain this time, of watching any hope of being a Firefighter, and a useful member of society flushed away, is something I cannot bare. Something I will not bare. Time and time again proves my life is going nowhere. No matter how hard I try, no matter where I go, no matter what I do, my dreams and hopes are always somehow destroyed by a dehabilating event like this. I've contemplated suicide before. Now it's a strong consideration of mine. I cant even get high on my drug Heroin to numb out because of this fucking Vivitrol shot I'm on. I'm sorry. I just need to get off my chest how I feel.

I’m a student who’s dealing with depression. 

I lost my dad about 3 and a half years ago but didn’t deal/process it in a healthy way. When he first passed, I fell into a depression but I kinda just put it in the back of my mind and was numb for 3 years, still going to school and working. 

Well last year, I transferred into a prestigious university and that’s when it came back. 

Being a first gen student, all you wanna do is prove to your parents that their sacrifices were worth it. And it hurt knowing that I would never be able to give that to my father. 

This year, I decided to get help. So I started seeing a therapist every week. It’s been almost 4 months of talk therapy and about 2 months of being on a low dose anti depressant. & honestly I feel that I have improved immensely. 

I have more energy and the ability to make myself study, I’m able to find peace and sleep throughout the night. I’m starting to reconnect with my family and slowly friends. I’m processing feelings and accepting my fathers death. 

However, there are times where I feel myself falling back. It’s the days where I don’t wanna eat, I just wanna leave campus and go home and sleep all day no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.

When I start to feel myself get worse, I get anxious and spiral quicker. But I don’t want to. 

Do you guys have any tips to come back? To make the days that you wake up feeling low...better? Ways to motivate yourself to not sleep all day?";mindybear-

I feel like the world I against me and now I find no joy in gardening or art, I can’t even sit down and enjoy a movie. All I want to do is curl up in a ball in my bed and never wake up. My suicidal thoughts come back, and hard. I feel like shit everyday, my bones are achy, my muscles are sore, my neck and shoulders hurt so bad I can’t even stretch them without crying. My love life starts circling the drain, my poor spouse can’t handle this sometimes. I’m 24 years old, yet I feel like I’m 60 and I just want to die. I’m sitting at home right now, after being sick for 2 weeks straight, and I can’t even get myself up to do the dishes. My thought start to spiral out of control and I think about my disabled brother and how I can’t help him because I can’t even help myself. My 16 year old sister has seen me break down crying and screaming because I can’t handle my brain  and my never ending anxious thoughts, and seeing my mom take me to the hospital so I can be 5150... three times. I thought I was doing better now that I’m living on my own and managing in the cannabis industry, I thought I had it made. But I’m still struggling financially, emotionally, and physically. My therapist says that I need to stop thinking so low of myself before we even handle my depression. But I’m just so exhausted I can’t even think about helping myself. Which makes me fear that I’m stuck here forever. I’m lost and don’t know what to do anymore.;slayer_2000

It feels like I am drowning and I lose control. But I cannot talk about that to my friends or my family because towards them I pretend to be strong and cool about stuff like that. They believe that, but in reality I feel like the more I build this emotional wall between me and them, the more lonely I become. It some kind of vicious circle imprisoning me in my own mind. 
I have never openly spoken about that, so I thought I would give it a try. Has anyone ever had a similar feeling and knows how to deal with it oder just improve the situation?

I finally had enough, and decided to go see a doctor about it. She prescribed me some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) that worked great. I have more positive days than bad now. However, I noticed that some of the reasons I was experiencing these negative emotions in the first place was because I was so lazy. This laziness makes me miss deadlines, become stressed about missing assignments, blow friends off to finish things last minute, eat unhealthy to save time when I'm cramming, etc... There was just this cascading effect of negative emotions that all stemmed from my inability to focus(Stress, anxiety, loneliness, frustration, etc..) I went back to the doctor after being on my SSRI for several months and was telling her how I was disappointed to see that although a lot of my symptoms were treated, and I am now a happier person than I was before, I believe the underlying issue was not fixed with my medicine and asked about whether she thought that some sort of dopamine reuptake inhibitors would help. In so many words she told me that she didn't think it would be wise to start experimenting with medications and that I should go and seek out a counselor before any changes are made to my medication. So now, I have to save up money to see a counselor multiple times, before I can really even tackle this problem. It could be several months before I can even get the medication I actually need to treat this. It just seems like all these hurdles are so insurmountable when you're depressed. Even something as little as scheduling an appointment seems like an enormous task. Everything just seems kind of overwhelming.;pancakelogan

For years I have been struggling with what felt like everything. In high school, I struggled to find a job, or do well in school, or do well in anything really. I barely managed to get the grades to get into the school I am in, and I hate it here. But in college now I was able to find a job, which led me to meet a lot of new people, and let me distract myself so I wasn't drowning in my own self hate. My grades here and now weren't fantastic but they are enough. But it feels like life is coming together. I applied to transfer schools to my dream school on the other side of the world, and I actually got in. I applied for a job I never in the world thought I would get, and I just got called for an interview earlier today. It feels like life is starting to not feel so pointless anymore. I haven't been genuinely happy in a long time, so smiling after getting the phone call today felt foreign to me. I really hope this is the start of something for me, because I need it.

I'm working so hard for a degree that doesn't interest me, so I can devote the next 40+ years of my life to a corporation that just sees me as another cog in their machine. I realize that this is just the way life is, but thinking about this makes me so sad. I can find happiness in my life when I'm not worrying about school or what careers may be the least miserable for me to pursue, but I just feel so lost and empty as ""work life"" is just so depressing. Seeing how the world is being run also adds to this sadness. Corrupt corporations ruining the planet and exploiting millions of lives all in the name of profit. A fundamentally corrupt political system which allows these corporations (which I may end up working for) to influence so many aspects of peoples' lives for their own benefit.

Only been back at uni 6 days. Feel less depressed even though I was anxious about going back and even wanted to revise and stay at home with my parents. I live quite far as well which doesn’t help. 

My first day of uni I cried, I had bad confidence, relatively high anxiety and was too scared to make friends. After I cried to my parents wanting to come home I said I’d try the week. I met nice people, made a couple good friends and thinks went up and up. Then I got cheated on and went into a deep depressive phase for 2-3 months, crying unexpectedly and the worst I’ve ever felt. Fast forward to now and that deep pain is less intense but still has shaped me. Took much much longer than average to get my life back on track but I guess everyone’s different. 

I’m back at uni and my friends are nice and good people. I’m lucky. I was very depressed when at home for Easter and thinking of ending my life. Although I’ve been back only 6 days, can anyone think why I feel a notably change? Is it due to more frequent social contact and more of a routine? 

Also I still can feel my depression but I almost force myself to get on with things at uni. Sometimes my friends rely on me to study with them or go cinema which I guess helps force me. For a while after being in a deep depressive phase I isolated some friends, I’m glad I didn’t isolate them all. This also showed me who were true friends and willing to stick by me in hard times.

Its not always, sometimes I'm fine, but it comes and goes. Sometimes it comes really hard as a form of anxiety, which messes up with my head and I am just unable to keep doing my office work. I am currently being treated for chronic gastritis. I don't consider it lethal but it worries me sometimes as its ""chronic"". I also have other personal issues, but its not life threatening so far. One day I was just thinking too much about it as I had a severe gastritis episode on the weekend. This probably triggered an anxiety attack and I was just unable to keep typing on the screen and I cancelled a meeting. I messaged a friend telling her how I was feeling. According to her point of view, my problems have a solution, so she didn't see anything wrong with me. I assume she thinks is no big deal. I told her the thoughts that were going through my head, being ""I feel this has been a horrible month"". Then I said, ""I'm starting to think 'I don't care anymore, its fine if I get whatever illness, no one is going to care anyway'"". She responded: ""I'm upset, I won't listen to you anymore if you keep that attitude. You never see what good things you have in life. I hate Emotial Blackmails and really, thats some way to make someone feel bad. If you have something to say, just say it. Nothing has happened to you. Eventually, when something bad happens to you, no one will believe you. Learn to appreciate the good things you have, I better stop. Bye""

It was about how people don’t really help you out when you’re down. I think that’s really true. Most of my life I’ve seen that people only support others if they became friends when that person provided something to them, whether it was laughter, company for some social events, shared life experiences, etc. Very rarely will people get together and support others just for the hell of it. 

The thing is that’s totally fine. I get it because I’m like that too. We all have our own selfish shit to deal with. We can’t truly put ourselves in someone else’s shoes. It’s just not going to happen and as a result you can’t completely empathize with another person. I don’t mean that everyone lacks empathy towards others, I mean that complete total empathy is only reserved for yourself because you are only in existence with your mind. 

With depression, it’s so hard to even build those connections in the first place because you go through your life floating. What kind of laughter, companionship, entertainment can I provide others to become my friends and support network. Then you fall even further, get more depressed, become less in touch with others, and the cycle keeps going. 

I think a lot of people enjoy their life or accept certain things about life like getting a job, getting married, etc. because they were a part of society. From a young age you share these moments with others and that’s your support. The people around you. If you’re outside of that, well you’re screwed. If you can fix that when you’re older, that’s great, but as I’m becoming more of an adult I realize that it gets even harder.";pseudomensch

I suspect i have had depression for years, i had a somewhat traumatic childhood that i never dealt with, i was apathetic for all of my highscool years, i made some friends but always lost contact, got a boyfriend who i loved so much but he cheated on me, he also groomed me(i was 16, he 21).
 At age 21 i finally moved out with my friend to pursue a higher education, had a new boyfriend also. Ended up failing to come to class because of insomnia and depression from my new roomie bullying me for my physical apperance and my new boyfriend cheating on me with a much older woman, and i felt out of place in my class with -18 year olds. I moved back home, stopped being friends with my roomie and dropped my bf.
Now i live alone with my brother who is lovely but innocent, i have two jobs that i dont care about but want to care about, i cant even care and consentrate enough to remember my new coworkers names, i have some debt, no support system or friends close, and an absolutely shattered self esteem... 
i have become apathetic, i have a cool new job oppertunity taking care of cute kids everyday, but im apathetic. My family loves me and support me, but im apathetic. Im young, fit and get told im pretty often, i still feel like an ugly ogre who doesnt deserve love and needs plastic surgery to look not even just “good” but normal.. What do i do? How can i kick my ass down to find a decent shrink? I can barely manage to be at work without obsessivly thinking about how weird and ugly i look, how far behind i am, how ungrateful i am, how horrible my personality is, how utterly broken my mind is, please someone how do i cope? How do i make new friends? How do i get out of this horrible rut?

389;Just a dumb nerd;3;biul05;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biul05/just_a_dumb_nerd/;0;2019-04-30 01:52:02;"Welp... I have gotten to this point haven't I? I have never posted my issues on Reddit, but recently I have been more broken than Windows Vista. So, first I should get some things straight for my story:
1. I know there are people in worse situations. 
2. This will be a bit long, so bear with me.
3. These are abbreviations you will need to know:
 SB = Stepbrother
 SD = Stepdad
 SG = Smart Guy
 F1 = Friend 1
 F2 = Friend 2 | So, I will cut the bull and get straight to it; I am a nerd. If you were to look it up in the dictionary I would be there. And, unfortunately, I was an only child and and was cursed with being short (Which is barely improving). Many people hate siblings or were glad they don't have one.... but I wish I had a sibling to help and defend me because of my stepbrother situation, more on that later. My family and friends say I am smart, and every grade I have gotten doesn't lie, but I sure don't feel like it. I am now in my mid-teens, and because of my voice and height, people confuse me for being a kid, and for being in grades 2-3 years behind what I am actually in. That irritates me enough, but even more so when somebody asks me for a ""kids menu"", THAT makes my blood boil. My mom actually used my height as a ""crutch"" to pay less money for a kids deal at a restaurant... ON MY GODDANGED 13TH BIRTHDAY, as I just told you with the kids menu crap, that kind of stuff irritates me halfway to China. *sigh* I am only getting started. Moving on, I was huge in chemistry, I LOVE chemistry. Now, to give some insight, only F1 and F2 would ever listen to my ideas and my opinions, I swear some people don't even acknowledge that I exist. This would happen often: I would be working with a group and either give an idea or answer to a question, but nobody would listen to my ideas for a presentation or project, and nobody would accept my answer for a group assignment (Often resulting in a wrong answer), however F1, F2, and SG are exceptions. In an attempt to get some respect, I participated in a chemistry challenge. Me, F1, and SG moved on past the qualifiers and the elimination round. However, when I didn't see my name or F1's name on the board for the people moving on to the state challenge, I kept looking for my name in desperation. My family kept saying before the challenge that I could totally make it to the state challenge, I kept telling them that I know I just wasn't good enough, even more so because SG was in it. SD rubbed the loss in my face, which hurt, because I studied so hard for it. As if the universe wanted to torture me, SG is now moving on to the national challenge. I blew it! I blew my one chance to finally show them that I am not just a nerdy piece of trash. I would joke and say the only things I am missing from the ""nerd collection"" are glasses and a pocket protector with a pen in it. Case in point, I have a really ""great"" stutter that results in them taking me even less seriously, I have a fine example of this: I was in the middle of health class explaining how arteries and veins work, and I kept stuttering the word ""deoxygenated"", the class burst into laughter, meanwhile I sat there wishing I was somewhere else. Now, I will bring to you one final issue (If you have had the patience to read this far). I had a divorced family, so on one side I had 2 step-family members: SB and SD. SB was much, MUCH stronger than me, and would often use his strength as a bargaining chip to get me to do something or let HIM do something. This has improved now, and I no longer get hit, but getting punched a lot of times gave me some serious post-traumatic stress, so I just let him do his crap without saying a peep. SD, is an entire new case. One time he automatically assumed that because there were Facebook pictures of me and my dad smiling and having fun, that I didn't want to be with my mom. That statement he had made hit me like a bus, because, I like to be with my mom, and the little alone time I get with her is precious to me. There are many other issues, and at one point there was a dang near family war between both sides of the family, meanwhile, I was pretty much Switzerland watching the chaos unfold in front of me, my soul was shredded to pieces during that war. However, I will only speak of one event, and that is the division of time allotted to my grandparents, namely, the ones on my mom's side. See, I was lucky enough to have both sets of grandparents and even a great grand parent into my teen years. And I would see one set of grandparents all the time. My mom's parent's though? Yeah.... I would see them very rarely, and I would always go over on Saturday, so I could be easily ready to go to church on Sunday and so I could see them. However, my mom claims says that I am ""running away from her house"". But that isn't true, my mom's parents live FAR from my dad and there is no chance I would be able to see them other than when I am with my mom. So, I take the chances I have to see them because of how rare it is. *Exhales* I think I am done. I know this was an abrupt ending, but I didn't have any fancy way to end this. Feel free to leave your opinions on this, and maybe give me some ideas or tips on how I can improve this. Also, I have been taking meds for the anxiety this causes me, but I am waiting for my higher dosage of it, and I do see a therapist, but there currently isn't enough money to go see him. So uh.... that's about it. And if there is anyone else like me out on the lands of Reddit, I wish the best for you.

I just don’t feel happy or motivated, except for special occasions, that mostly involve my girlfriend.  I’m currently in a long distance relationship and my girlfriend is gonna move in with me in about a month. My happiness is strongly dependent on her, without her I just feel bad. I have other friends that I hangout with occasionally, but in general I’m mostly at home and playing video games, so I’m not doing a lot except when she’s with me. 
My parents are worried I’m putting to much of a burden on my girlfriend, since she’s the only one I’m willing to share my problems with. I understand that reasoning so my question is if I should see a psychologist and if recommended take antidepressants? My sister took those and said it was terrible so I’m worried.

395;Reminder that you're not crazy and your feelings are valid;23;biuhvb;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biuhvb/reminder_that_youre_not_crazy_and_your_feelings/;5;2019-04-30 01:44:32;"Hey guys. Just wanted to share some thought that have helped me recently.

While learning about the medical side of depression is important and helpful, I've found that, for me at least, identifying myself as a ""depressed person"" medically speaking has hindered my healing journey and led to lots of frustration. There are definitely physiological components to depression. I'm not saying to ignore your doctor's advice or not take meds or anything like that. But when you're constantly told that you are mentally ill, that your perspective is warped, that you are victims of cognitive distortions all the time, it can really cement the notion that you are a defective person, and that the things you feel are somehow unreal. For me, it took me a very long time to even consider the possibility of having a purpose in life because I generally view life and the world as a very negative, stressful experience, and when going to psychologists, I was always told that my worldview was abnormal or wrong in some form or another. Doctors would never even address it really. They'd hear how stressed and suicidal I had become and they'd simply increase the dosage on my anti-depressants. Recently though, I experienced a breakthrough that helped me a great deal. I thought ""Maybe I'm not crazy....maybe the world really IS generally stressful and negative and life's going to be hard....but maybe now that I know that, I can come to terms with my worldview and work to help heal myself and others as best as I can."" When we express our deep, painful feelings to people we trust and get told that ""oh, that's just negative thinking"" or ""it'll get better someday"", it can really hurt and invalidate our suffering at times. It implies that there's a ""right and wrong way to think/feel"" and that, because you view things more pessimistically or get overwhelmed and stressed easily, your thoughts must be ""wrong"" and so must be worked on and corrected. This can lead to years of frustrating therapy where you still believe and feel the things your pain tells you no matter how much you get told to ignore it or replace it with more positive thinking.

&#x200B;

Once again, this approach may not be for everybody. Some people find it liberating to view their negative thoughts as an illness, and that's okay. I also want to stress that its very important to be actively working to distinguish which thoughts might be hinting at something deeper that you believe in and those which are unhealthy coping mechanisms or fueled by negative psychological reinforcement. Self-deprecating thoughts like ""I hate myself"", ""I'm worthless"", and such are probably not the whole ""truth"", and should be considered with caution. But, if you're like me and feel that there's just this vague, overwhelming feeling that ""something is wrong with the world"", I would suggest paying attention to your feelings and not outright dismissing them every time someone suggests they're wrong. They might be insights into some core beliefs that shape you as a person, and could potentially help you move on from them.";Rayden_Greywolf

My wife and I are moving to a new city soon. She is going to graduate school in what I would call a tier 2 US city. It's not New York or LA or Chicago, but it's in the top 20 largest cities in the country. Normally, this wouldn't be saying much, except I am writing this post from a movie theater that has more seats that there were people in the town I grew up in (I'm 40 minutes early for the show. I'm the only one here. And hiding in a dark room seems less scary than walking around) 

She grew up here. This is like coming home for her, but for me it's almost like being on another planet. I'm not used to cities. The traffic, congestion, confusion, and just the people. It's all so different.

I'm in the city now getting things ready for our official move next week. I'm between appointments for apartment tours and had a job interview this morning. I'll be back home in a few days to finish packing and actually move but for now I'm here in this huge, overwhelming metropolitan world alone.

If this were a vacation or a short term holdover for a few months, I think I would be less afraid, but we plan to live here for 6-8 years while my wife gets her PhD. I'm just scared. I don't know anyone or anything here and it all seems way too huge to know where to start. I'm afraid that I'll fall back into my worst depressed tendencies of avoiding the world and burying my head anytime I'm not forced to go outside. I know that will be bad for me, but I don't know how I would react to trying to go out and socialize and function in this new world. Will I be able to adapt and get past my fears?

Basically, if I stare at a face while watching a TV show, I suddenly get distracted by another object present in that specific scene.

I'm more interested in solving my muscle spasms though, since these can make me neurotic. These are usually focused on my legs or the back of my neck (thus making it harder to focus on a task).

I recently stop taking my antidepressants and trying to see a therapist. I know I shouldn’t have stop taking my medication. But it wasn’t working. It was basically trail and error type of problem with my medicine. My doctors never thought my depression was even there. They thought it was because of my ex breaking my heart. But however I am going to a therapist to provide me with the right medicine. 

I wanted to provide a background of myself for people to understand I am not crazy. Me being off my medicine makes me say, think, and do things that would be consider crazy. 

I have experienced the worst feelings in the world being off my medicine. Let me explain to you what I am taking about. First of all my body is just not wanting to do absolutely anything. This is definitely not me being lazy because I am a very motivation person when it comes to everything. My body feels so tingly like it wasn’t suppose to be attach to my body. My legs and arms go to “ sleep” very very often. 

I have been having a dream about this boy who is possessed. His name is Damon. When I was trying to help him, I would often read “his” journal. Not realizing this in the dream, but from thinking about over and over again. I realized that his journal was mine IRL. I don’t write really ever in my journal, so this was really strange of me to even dream about this. But nearly every page was filled with writing. However, I couldn’t read the writing in the dream. 

Imagine having 100 different version of you, all doing a million things. That’s how I feel in my head. Even just sitting and staring at a wall my mind is going in five hundred different directions. One wants me to end it. One wants me to get out of bed. One tells me to at least cut myself. One tells me go fight. One tells me I’m going to be nothing. One tells me to quit my job. One tells me to stay at my job. I would type out every single thing but it was too much and this post would be way too long. 

My mind is telling me it’s done with typing so I’ll keep everyone updated. I am sorry it just kind of just ended but that’s how my mind works.";isntlifehorrible

CW: Friend’s Suicide, Suicidal Ideation, Serious Depression, BPD

I’m in college and moved out within the past couple of months into my partner’s house. Not long before the move, in January, a friend of mine killed themself. When that happened, all hell went lose inside my head. I couldn’t keep up with school and dropped almost all my classes, and the classes I stayed in, everything was turned in late. Luckily I had that fancy paper from the office of disabilities that gave me more time on assignments, and my professors were understanding. Anyhow, I moved in hopes it would help me feel better. It really didn’t. I’m 20 (Non binary) and have been struggling with depression and BPD since I was 15. But last semester, before the friend’s suicide, I was doing really, really well. I got all As and Bs, and brought my GPA up almost to a 3.0 (I had a rough freshman year). I’m not on any medication right now due to my own failings of not taking it for three weeks, but next Monday (a week from today) I’m going to start in an intensive outpatient program where they’ll be monitoring my meds. I don’t know what exactly I hope from this post, but I’m trying to get any advice on things I can do to try and stay stable since I haven’t been able to, and how to gain a sense of normalcy again? I’m trying to set up a morning and nightly routine, and I don’t have to worry about school again until August. Other than that, I don’t know what else to do but attend therapy on Monday. I’m trying my best to get better, but I don’t know how to get better again in the first place.";apollo10145

TL;DR I completely planned out my suicide and didn’t go through with my plan. The day I was meant to die has passed and I keep feeling really weird about being still alive.


I’ve been really depressed for the past 8months but pretending to most of the world I’m fine. Ive been working through some childhood sexual abuse stuff (turns out you can’t bury that forever...). The perp is still alive and an integral member of family so trying to navigate that and attempting to maintain close relationships with other family has been difficult.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts and negative self worth for as long as I can remember but it’s been really active for the past 8months, and I convinced myself that my death and getting out of everyone’s way was for the best. I planned my suicide over 4months - finding the perfect methods, planning everything, sorting out money for the funeral, writing the people I love letters to apologise and to try to help them move on. I got all of my stuff in order and all of the things I had on the go were either done or ready to hand over to someone else.
I’d decided on 23rd of April, because I knew I was seeing my grandma two days before and it would give me chance to say goodbye to her properly in my head.

A couple of weeks ago I started feeling a little better (read: a little less actively suicidal) and as the day got closer I decided to put it on hold. The day before it was meant to happen I got rid of the letters - something I regretted immediately and also felt free immediately - as I knew I wouldn’t kill myself without leaving something for the people who love me (even if I don’t understand why).

The day came and went. My mood is still pretty shit, but I’m still less actively suicidal.
I’m like 60% glad I didn’t do it.
But I’m not sure how to move on. I know I should be dead now, and I don’t know how I feel about it. I don’t know how to get past the feeling that I shouldn’t be here still.

I want to hear other peoples stories and maybe how you guys have dealt with what I am dealing with because its weird and idk.

&#x200B;

So my parents divorced when I was very young, and for a long time my time was split 50/50 with mom and dad. Me and my dad are literally best friends, we talk to each other and have more in common than anyone else we know. He is the kind of dad that always wakes you up and has a coffee ready for you, or breakfast already on the table. The problem is when I was 12 he had to move very far away for a really good job. I do not resent him for it ever, but it has certainly made shit really suck. So ever since that happened every year I have only ever been able to visit him once a year. Sometimes its for 10 or 12 weeks, sometimes like this previous visit, its only for 2 weeks. I always have an incredible time. We dont even do much, just play video games together, watch movies, go out to eat, sometimes just simply sit at home and hang out. Every time I come back from one of these trips I am an absolute wreck. I can usually make it through the airport and the plane ride before I break down, but once I get home I immediately starting crying my eyes out. I do not want to eat, I do not want to work, I do not want to do anything. I used to think that was a reasonable response to a kid after seeing then not seeing his parent he loves, but the problem is I am 26 years old now. I am an adult. Why do I still respond in this way?  And honestly as I get older it almost seems to get worse as all I can think about is how we are both getting older and I just feel like our already limited time together is even more limited by these visits. I am crying as I type this but sitting alone in my house was going to make me go insane so I am here venting on reddit because as I said my dad is my best friend and really, I dont have any other friends. 

&#x200B;

I just want to be an adult who can handle visiting a parent and then coming back to my own life without having a complete breakdown. I do not expect anyone reading this to somehow magically know a solution or anything, I just wanna talk about it. It really makes me feel better to talk about it and I hope this post isnt super weird or anything. If you read all this, thanks alot.";Broodn4x

She told me that I don’t have a personality disorder and that I only have depression and I will get through it. My problem is that i want to quit therapy because I don’t really feel that she’s helping and really understanding me. I really have a lot of emotions going on and being in high school doesn’t really help. I have a lot of unstable relationships and i reject everyone that cares about me, because i’m convinced that they’ve a lot of friends and don’t care about me and therefore they will eventually disappoint and hurt me. I got to the point that I “idolize” my therapist but then think that I’m just one of her patients and that she doesn’t really care about me. Even tough everyone tells me i’m beautiful and skinny I have an unstable self image. I hate my body and I go from what I call binging (i fell like I am eating a lot, tough I eat what everyone should eat daily) to starving myself. I experience dissociation while I’m at school or surrounded by a lot of people. I don’t do my homework (because I can’t concentrate)and my grades are really bad, but I’ve been cheating on every test and I’m getting some decent grades since. I’m starting to think of suicide everyday and I always think that I’m not living life to the fullest, because I can’t enjoy anything I do (watching a film, listen to music, going to school). I already had suicide thoughts, but now I am starting to really considering them. Everyday I feel hopeless and sad and when I go out with my “friends” (rarely), after one hour I get tired of them, and if I was enjoying them, then I would start to feel hopeless or having dissociations again. One time I got drunk and sometimes I try to cut my wrists ( even if unsuccessfully, because I really am afraid of physical pain, because of the operation I got at my feet, and of blood). I go trough phases of sleeping a lot and barely sleep. Many people told me that I’m more intelligent than others, but I feel unworthy and that I am the dumbest person on earth. When I start feeling hopeless and unworthy or sad or I start dissociating and feeling a brain fog, I start acting like bitchy, even tough my personality is sweet and kind. I have a strange relationship with my dad (he’s a little narcissist and an alcohol addict and he is really alone so he rely on me very much. When I don’t spend time with him he makes me feel guilty about it). I to avoid arguments my mom and they’re divorced. When I was a child I’ve been experiencing traumas (my parents breaking up, my brother screaming etc). Since I was a kid I wanted a friendship where my friend had only to be with me and no one else, or I really got jealous (and I still do it). And finally I think that writing this has been more liberating than going to my therapy session. I feel like my therapist really underestimated my symptoms. I surely missed out a lot of details, but I hope that this is sufficient to help you understand my situation. I really think that this is not only depression, but bpd. What do you think?

But I'm no longer putting in effort. I don't want to do anything new. I don't want to meet new people or make new friends. I'll stay at my current job until it ends one way or another. I'll live in my current home until circumstances force me to change. I'm not going to travel to new places. I no longer want romance or to ever have a boyfriend. I never want to have sex again. I'm finished with goals and desires. I'll deal with difficulties and complications as they arise. I just want to sit in my house night after night watching sitcoms alone, living frugally and as low impact as I practically can. Any remaining wisp of joy I had left when my best friend left this world in March. I'm just waiting out my days until I can have beers with him again on a sunny patio somewhere. Until then I'm just biding my time, waiting for life to finally be over.;tillandsia_tortoise

They all are in a relation ship with someone. My friends are also all in a relationship. 
I just turned 21 and I feel desperately lonely. I've had only 1 relationship in my entire life and it didn't last long. 3 years ago, I met this girl from my class and we hooked up at party and decided later to get into a relationship, we loved each other but it ended with me not being able to control her jealousy nor my feelings as I wasn't used to being in a relationship. I would not say that my only problem is getting into a relationship because I honestly could wait to get the right girl who totally matches me but it is definitely the main reason of me feeling shitty. I feel depressed and lonely because I don't speak to people a lot and my family is pressuring me : They keep judging me bringing up the fact that I'm still alone at 21 but none of my cousins is.

While this sounds nice, I've had some very very dark times since transferring here. I abuse alcohol (not as much anymore), I lost my virginity to a stranger while drunk, I recently got dumped after an short term unhealthy relationship, and my GPA is around a 2.6.

I tried to challenge myself for the Spring by taking 8 am classes and I've been to class once in the past 3 weeks. I hear my alarm go off, but I physically cannot get out of bed. I feel heavy, extremely anxious, and have racing thoughts. This causes me to turn off my alarm and go back to sleep. 

Even when I do go to class, I cannot focus. I turn in assignments late and me trying to study is a joke.

I wasn't always like this, I transferred with a 3.4 to my school. But I had a support system and my loved ones. Since being here, I've never ever felt more lonely and so the last thing I wanna focus on is schoolwork. Which is essentially why I focused on the partying, drinking, drama, and relationships because I felt less lonely.

Some stuff happened that has made me hurt really bad. Almost all of it has to do with my social life and how it's not where I want it to be. I have many friends, but a lot of the ones I've grown closest to are super toxic and not really healthy people to be around, and the people I want to be closest to are shy and have their own mental health issues that can often make being social hard. I'm a very social person, so this kind of thing honestly scares me. I have a bad relationship with my parents that I want to be better, but I've gone through so much shit from them, I don't know if that's possible, which makes me really sad.

&#x200B;

To make things even more confusing, I haven't been super interested in talking to anyone because I'm depressed, which makes everything I actually want to do harder, which cycles over and over again. I've been feeling sick and tired at work because of how bad I feel, and I can't afford to call out, so I've just been pushing through it and texting my boyfriend when I can.

I'm not really sure if I'm asking for anything here. I'm just venting, mostly. I've had depression for as long as I can remember, and it was often this bad when I was still living with my parents.

442;Abilify Withdrawal Symptoms;1;bite8g;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bite8g/abilify_withdrawal_symptoms/;1;2019-04-29 16:10:50;"Hey everyone.

I went to another province for fun for an entire month in March, quit my medication of Abilify 2mg cold turkey around the same time and started getting severe headaches, vomiting, nausea and other symptoms that mimic pregnancy. I'm not pregnant. Went back to my hometown last month and I still experience really bad headaches, dizziness occasionally and have puked three times this past month. It's not as bad as it was originally, but I got bloodwork done and just saw my family doc today. She said that my results were fine, that it's probably just withdrawal symptoms + anxiety being in a new province. 

The thing is, I was only consistently taking the medication for one almost two weeks - before that I would be really bad with it. I've quit Abilify cold turkey before with no withdrawal symptoms. I'm just concerned that my doctor brushed me off because I'm young.

So basically, I've been apparently having withdrawal symptoms for 2 months now from a low dose that I wasn't on for a long time. To me that seems like a stretch. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Also I saw a walk-in doc too and he thinks I might have anemia.";desktomi

444;Advice Needed: Keeping it Bottled;2;bit64f;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bit64f/advice_needed_keeping_it_bottled/;1;2019-04-29 15:51:47;"First post- uh, ever. Hopefully the last, since I'm only speaking up to learn how to keep quiet. Apologies in advance for morbid reddit-cultural faux pas.

Female, 28, incapable of a relationship, working full time.

Life is mostly pretty empty. I have *sort of* come to terms with that and I've found *some* purpose in a pretty all-consuming hobby of mine that I'm pretty lucky to have. It's how I've gained a lot of online friends and fulfillment for now. But I want to keep those friends, and that means I need to crack down on my tendency to talk about myself, or reveal how truly alone, pointless, and empty I feel when asked how I am.

The problem, of course, is wanting to talk about it at all. I have a therapist; my friends don't need to have all that dumped on them. Especially not my best friend, who knows I struggle, but I'm terrified that I've spent the better part of two years ruining our friendship with regular panic attacks and stressed rambling. My best friend has been nothing short of valiant and validating, but... I like to think I'm smart enough to know when I'm being given distance. That's a sign for me that things have gotten out of hand. That I need to at least give the *illusion* that things are alright while I repair things behind the facade.

Now, I know damn well that I shouldn't keep things bottled up, but with the exception of therapy, it has NEVER done me any good to talk about how I feel in such stark, black honesty, and even then I was told ""You're saying some things that worry me a bit"" and I can't afford to take off work for an Intensive Outpatient Program. So I stopped being completely honest there too. It seems like the whole rhetoric of ""just tell someone!!"" is only good on paper, and I've read too many horror stories from people who checked themselves in.

I have to look for alternative solutions and distractions from talking about myself in any negative capacity, or I start losing the people I care for, and that's simply the reality of it. People don't like to know their friends are hurting, and they don't know how to handle it, so they don't and they back off. And that's okay. My life is not theirs to fix. My day is not theirs to improve, and if they happen to do so unknowingly, it's not a burden on their part.

**So how do you all keep it in?**

I'm really good at not crying. I don't really cry, haven't in years except for some occasional glassy eyes and maybe a tear or two if I'm lucky. As much as I'd like to have that emotional outlet (if only for myself to privately vent), it always results in an awful migraine anyway so, it's just better that I don't.";speaking-in-circles

Life is not that hard for me, I know there are too many people in the world that live in a far worse situation than me and maybe I do not  have the right to complain. If I want to do with my life , yes I can make it. But the really problem is that the life is not too hard but it is really boring. Living in a city alone, there is no friend to hang around, no one. I had friends in school, but now I am graduated and all of them are wording or raising babies. Go to school, then get a work, moreover, get married and have babies. These are good, pretty good, if you like them. But I can't have a life like this, because it is too boring, you can even imagine what the life looks like after thirty years. This is why I can accept it, no surprise at all. I decide to search for my own life, something different, that is why I feel so damn lonely. 

&#x200B;

Sitting in front of a broken computer, I can spend about a half of my day. Because of too much leisure time, I start to think a lot of things which I should not, such as my old friends, very old friends which do not have any connection for many years. I also dream them at night, which is really hilarious because they still have a child like face and that is weird. They are as old as me, which means they have a lot of wrinkles and white hairs. They all lie in my social account, and we know there is really no need to contact each other because there is nothing left but some awkward small talk. Time faded everything.

This post is purely for venting as there is not much I can do now. Unfortunately this is just one of the many ways my experience with mental illness (depression, BPD) has been mishandled by family and professionals. 

I recently ordered my discharge papers from a visit to the Behavioral Health Unit (psych ward) on New Year’s 2017. I was going through what was most likely a psychotic break and I lived with my family who did not understand or accept my mental health issues. It pushed me over the edge, and one night during an altercation with my family, I dove for the kitchen knives and tried to kill my self. 

When the police arrived, I was sitting on the couch, emotional but very still. An officer yanked me by the arm and manhandled me into a pair of cuffs. I was compliant but very bitter towards my parents because I had just discussed voluntarily checking myself into an inpatient program, but they ignored the issue until it got worse. I said some hateful things to my mother on my way out the door, but I never raised my voice. Yes I was angry and emotional, but more than anything I felt defeated. 

A lot of terrible things happened during that visit, I couldn’t fit it all here if I tried. I was left in the front area of the hospital in cuffs for everyone to look at, I was told to just “smoke a joint and feel better,” nurses laughed at my symptoms to my face, etc. 

These are all old wounds, but reading over this paperwork (for the first time) has rubbed salt in them. The statement says that I was screaming when I left the house, which is completely untrue and really gets under my skin. My concerns had been ignored by my family for years, and then law enforcement treated me like a criminal. I was too hopeless to scream, and to me it is just another example of the ill being vilified. 

The statement indicated that I “pulled a knife” on my step father. I laughed out loud. The knives were no where near anyone but myself. 

Then I read that “law enforcement obtained information that the patient had previously tried to hang herself.” And for some reason this absolutely floored me. That is not true. That is not even slightly true. It is not something I have ever wanted to do, nor something I have ever threatened to do. 

I can’t stop wondering where it came from. It should not eat at me the way it is, but I can’t help it. Did my family say that? Did the police add it for their own little flair? It is completely untrue yet there it is, plain as day in black and white. 

I don’t get it. I was suicidal so maybe I don’t have that much right to be upset, but damn it, I am.";pumpkinfear

I browse this sub and similar subs and my heart hurts for those who are in pain and I rejoice when those of you find yourselves better than you were the last day. I've struggled with my own mental illnesses throughout my life and have seen friends and family suffer the same. Unfortunately, this last January my best friend lost his battle with his. He came home from work after a seemingly ""normal"" day and ended it all. I was back at college preparing for the next semester when my brother called and told me the news. My mind shut off and my legs were shaky, I couldn't breathe and the world around me seemed to collapse. My parents were there with his parents and held his had as he officially passed in the hospital. I spoke at his funeral, I cried when I saw more than 800 people fill a large chapel making it look small. He was the best; he was loud, funny, quirky, off his rocker, and 110% no matter what it was.

I've known him since I was 5 years old. He was two years older than me so it was like he was my big brother. We didn't keep in touch often but just like with my blood sibling, I knew what he was doing and he knew where I was. Every time I came home from college he was there in whatever we were doing. As these days go on and I miss my friend dearly, I think back on the little things. Day by day I have these reminders of him through everything I do. I remember the times we used to spin ourselves sick on the merry-go-round as I pass local playgrounds. I remember the time he told me Nazareth was this dope band even though I knew he'd never heard them when I place their record on the turn table. I remember his stance and smile he had when I was trading him my Steve Maddens for his Chacos. But, at the end of the day I remember he is not here anymore. I remember that there will be no more cigars on the porch. I remember there is no more sandwiches and beer at his favorite sandwich shop. I remember that his friends and his family don't get to go on with his contagious laugh. My life will forever be duller without him.

I wanted to tell all of you this. I wanted to let you all know that this world will forever be duller without you. I wanted to tell you that even though you feel alone and you feel like no one is there for you,  you matter to someone. Without you there will be no more of the little things, there will be no more smiles, there will be no one like you. No one can fill the hole that you will leave. If you are struggling, please please please get help. I'm pleading with you. If you feel the way my friend felt, put yourself in my shoes and imagine your best friend gone. I am here to struggle with you, theres no need to end it. I am putting myself out there for you. Call 1-800-273-8255, the suicide hotline if you ever have the feeling.

This is a problem that has been talked about multiple times, and it honestly won't reside until we're off on our own (it's been this way my whole life). 

During the week days, I find myself staying in my room and sinking into depression / anxiety, with a lack of motivation. I try to stay busy but there's a lot I feel like I can't do because I'll be constantly questioned or told I'm doing it wrong. My husband doesn't come home till around 5ish. During the weekends, my husband is a busy person... We share the same hobby and passion, but I lack the knowledge, so I sit on the side lines a lot.  

Well, I came up with this idea of getting a dog, because it will keep me distracted, busy, cheer me up, make me feel responsible and good, get me out of the house etc... It's even been suggested by my psyciatrist that I could benefit from a emotional support or service dog. Both families love animals. They each have one dog that's attached to them. I do have fear though that I'll lack motivation, and that I won't be able to handle it... But I've always been negative and doubtful with myself and it always holds me back. 

My husband said no because of the traveling back and forth and the responsibility. I've pleaded, I've explained. I don't want to sit alone anymore. I need something that pushes me. He said when we are on our own officially... Which I understand but at the same time, when we are on our own I'll feel less caged and will be able to probably get back into my hobbies without fear of being treated like a child and questioned all the time. I have all this free time, alone, now. It's not fair to me because everyone else have happy normal lives. Why can't I have something that can help me?

Update: I have some codependency issues so I feel that having something that wants and needs me constantly, since no one can, would cure that void for me too a bit. I'm really angry because I bend for everyone and let everyone have what they want and their ways. Whatever my husband wants I let him have and don't complain or question it.... Same with the families. Sigh.";MrsR35

It meant a big drop in household income and he left a job he loved, although he's happy in the new job. I'd put things on hold for his career for a few years so it was my turn.

I found a job really fast and got some interview for PhD courses and felt everything was going well. 

Well... in the last 4 months... the job fell through, another pulled a bait and switch on me, I've burnt through a ton of savings as a result, got a huge fine from HMRC for underpaying tax by £50 because they sent letters to the wrong address so I never got them, lost one of my oldest friends, got a place on my dream course only to have funding denied on a technicality which now renders me ineligible, had a reference refuse to provide me with a new reference as 2 jobs went wrong so I'm now stuck waiting to start a job that sounds awful and pays badly with no option to try and get another, I've gained a load of weight.

I tried to kill myself a few times in my teens and really thought I was so far past all that. I have always struggled with anxiety but this is different. I just cry. All. The. Time. I spend days at a time in bed. For the first time in 10 years I am having to seriously fight not to self harm or relapse with my eating disorder. I cannot see any way forwards. My life is ruined.

I have been in therapy since I was 15, I went to a new clinic at 18 and have been going there ever since. I am 27 now. 
I have changed therapists at that clinic many times, because well, most of them f***g suck.
One therapist after another has been just talking. Talking like you would to a friend.

My adolescent therapist from age 15-18 was the only therapist who helped me. 
I like the kind that give you actual CBT and aren't just talk.

This current therapist was basically perfect. She gave me real CBT. There were work sheets. She helped me learn to redirect my negative thoughts.

I see her every 2 weeks and 2 weeks ago I was finally opening up about my abusive relationship I was in as a teen. I never was able to tell anyone that the guy raped me. I was finally working up to it in our last session. I told her about his controlling ways, his drinking. She knew there was more but I wasn't ready yet. 
Now she will never know.

I am so tired of this. This sucks majorly I cannot stop crying and I don't know how I will find a competent therapist and how I will be able to build up the trust and feel safe enough to talk about my trauma as well as continue working on everything this therapist has been helping me with. 

I am feeling closed off and extremely pessimistic.

lately, I've been thinking alot about my parents again. I've visited them this weekend and realized how sad and devasted it makes me feel to see them.

I just can't bear the thought that they are getting older and older, that they don't have the wonderful and nice life they would deserve. They have been working all their life, six days a week all day long. They only take two weeks off a year.

Their marriage life has been a disaster and is still an ongoing trauma and fight. Since I've been born, I can barely imagine a day without seeing and hearing them fighting.

Due to this, I have often been unfair and very withdrawn torwards my parents. I hated them for a long time. It was just very ugly...

But now, I forgave them. I understand them. I feel so sorry for everything they gave up. I just love them. But I can't stop crying thinking about all of what went wrong between us and in their lifes. I feel guilty for having a nice and easy life because it's what they never had. They even did all they could to give me a comfortable life. It makes it hard to carry on with my life, and there is just so much I want to accomplish and that I have to manage right now.

I really don't know what to do about it. Normally, it would take weeks or even months to cry out all of that grief that has piled up inside of me, but there's just no time for that right now...";Bananaz45

Since we've started dating again his depression has gotten worse for his work life and home life isn't great and he will just get into low moods for no reason and will sometimes not message for a day or two because he hates messaging (gives him anxiety) and when he's in a depressed mood he will also just space out and not message anyone over a weekend.

I have really bad anxiety, possibly genetic from my mother and I also used to drink a lot to suppress negative emotions which after 1 too many I'd be at risk of self harm. I'm in a shitty financial situation but only for the next 4 months. I've never been able to fully trust people, I dont get along with everyone as well as other people do but I am genuinely nice and genuinely care about treating people right. My girlfriend is 19 and I never took the relationship seriously at first because I wanted to avoid loving her so much that my anxiety and fears would start kicking in and ruin the simple relationship we had. But she's been through all my bad and has stuck around, though I've caused her to become slightly distant, and it sucks because when I didnt care enough she wanted to be with me all the time. I do truly trust her when i think logically about things. I've made her want to pull back to avoid me hurting her, not that I ever would. But I always come at her negatively with my insecurities and when I push 1 too many buttons and agitate her I immediately regret it. Aside from the relationship, I have always had slight depression, I've never believed it was a sickness until these past few years where I start seeing no point in my life anymore. I dont want to eat as much, I only want to be with her but she wants her space and she will still hang out with me 4-6 times a week, I dont understand or maybe i do understand, why i want to be with her all the time. I'm crazy about her and aee us having a future but i need to be able to work on myself and it just doesnt seem possible. If I'm not depressed I'm angry and if I'm angry i do regrettable things. When i do suppress my emotions and thoughts i just sit at home not doing anything, I've recently started to force myself to exercise and lift but it only helps very momentarily, I dont know if I have some sort of chemical imbalance but because of my financial struggle I cant afford to even begin to find treatment. I'm starting to let my issues ruin the one thing I have going good for me  because when I'm with her everything is perfect. I want to feel that way always and have her not worry that I'm going to attack her when we're not together, I dont know how to communicate with her any other way I feel like she doesnt really know what's going on in my head when I act. I also don't wish for her to understand how my mind works. I dont want to be contagious. I just want to stop feeling shitty and I want to have a better positive life. It's hard to distract myself and it's also still hard to focus on anything other than negative thoughts. I could go on but. If there is any advice on how to get through this and save my relationship I really need it. I'm very chivalrous, she knows how much I love her and I know how much she loves me, but when we're not together I cant stop thinking negatively on every aspect of my life...;Riggedid

There are a lot of people around me with depression/mental illness. My long term boyfriend (24M), my younger sister, my younger brother, my older sister, my stepdad. So I’ve seen what it can do and how differently it can affect people, so I thought when it happened to me I would notice right away!

Well I didn’t. Seemingly out of nowhere, I feel like I was just weighed down so badly. I didn’t even really notice until my bf pointed out to me how I hadn’t done homework, laundry, or dishes in over a month. (I know that makes him sound bad, but typically I do majority housework because I have more free time. He picked up the slack while I was in this state). Anyways, I honestly felt like I was half of me...just a shell pretty much. I had no appetite, no desire to pull myself off the couch and do something, and I wasn’t really sad so much as I just wasn’t there. But there were moments of overwhelming sadness where all I wanted to do was cry. 

I guess I’m just hoping to get any and all info/advice from anyone?

Part of the reason I think that this is going on is that I’ve had some health problems recently, so I have bills piling up and since I have class 3 days a week I’m only working 2 twelve hour shifts a week and whatever I can get on the weekends, but that = no money. I also withdrew mentally from school and classes are harder and harder to make myself go to, so being behind is making things worse. 

Some of my health issues include a really fast heart rate that we’re trying to figure out...they put me on beta blockers to try and lower it + anxiety levels. They also put me on a vitamin d supplement since my levels were extremely low. I’m also seeing a neurologist for frequent headaches. He has me on a medicine that’s an antidepressant but is also used to treat headaches. 

Before I was put on the beta blocker, I was on cymbalta for anxiety (I didn’t think cymbalta was used to treat anxiety but I’m not a dr). That stuff really made everything worse for me. I honestly felt like I was drowning and there was no way out. That was the worst of it. The beta blocker has lifted me out of that funk but now after using the blocker for a couple of months, I feel like I’m slipping back into that state. I’m randomly so overwhelmed that I feel like all I can do is curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep. But other times I’m in a really, really good mood! I will feel good about myself and my body and I’ll legit feel like “I can tackle school and my bills!! I will make it out of this no problem!” That’s how the old me would feel majority of the time. And I love feeling that way. But it lasts maybe for a couple hours and then I go back to normal or back to feeling a bit down. 

I’m exhausted going back and forth between these emotions. I don’t know what to do, I’m scared to keep putting all of these medications in me because I’m wondering if they’re the problem (maybe they’re interacting badly or my body doesn’t like them) I just want to feel like me again. I want to have fun and not be surrounded by this dark cloud. I want to be the person who helps lift people out of their funk again instead of being the person who is in it. I’m sorry if I offend anyone by anything I said I just am new to feeling things like this so it’s all very different to me. 

Please, feel free to tell me your stories or anything you found that helps/helped you.

TLDR: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with depression/feel like myself again.";Bubbly42

I was not diagnosed with depression by a therapist but I really feel like shit all the time. My friends keep suggesting me to see a therapist and I'm looking forward to see one if needed.

All my friend are online friends and pretty much have no irl friends. I try and be friendly all the time to everyone and occasionally initiate conversation but no one reaches back out after a quick conversation. I feel lonely all the time. I hate school but didn’t used to and I just don’t want to do work for any class.  I play a lot of video games w/ my online friends but as soon as I get off I get sad and lonely again and just feel like listening to music. I used to have friend where I used to lobe but had to move and leave my closest friends ever. Whenever I get into social situations for example our bands concert last night, I put on a mask and try to be as  happy go lucky as I can be. I guess I don’t want to be a burden to people and that’s why I don’t tell people how I feel. I try and hide my flaws and I am super self conscious about by appearance. I met a girl on xbox and we have talked a lot on FaceTime but I don’t know if she actually means it when she calls me attractive or not. I know she lives far away but I get even more lonely and sad knowing other Xbox friend have her nudes and she told me she flirts with everyone and it makes me feel like another one of her pawns in her game of chess . She is the first person to tell me I’m attractive and cute but I don’t think it means anything.  I don’t know what my future looks like and I don’t know how I’m gonna hey through the rest of high school. Every day I wake up and feel down and when I get to school is no better. And then I put in the happy mask to not show how I truly feel.

I went through something I don't think many have (fucking fortunately.) where my mother purposely murdered my little brother. It was already a nightmare enough but she only got 6 months imprisoned because she had no previous record and the police messed up on her miranda rights (basically the whole ""you have the right to remain silent"") leading to some facts not being allowed in court and the judge very clearly having a female bias. She admitted in court that she did do it but because of a plea, got barely any time. She also admitted she would do it again, years later when she found me online.

I have nothing against the judge part. I think that there are times, as a man, that I cannot understand why he would do this but I am not a judge and he publicly apologized in the newspaper saying that in retrospect, he would have done differently.

That being said, this happened almost 18 years ago when I was young and it has crushed me on a daily basis. I was the last person she talked to before she did it. Because myself and my other little brother wouldnt live with her instead of my dad, she said i would regret my decision, fuck off and hung up on me. Got the call the next day.

I have had a life of pretty awful things one after another. I have somehow not turned to drugs and alcohol, as tempting as they are. It's all things that are just unavoidable yet that event.. I cannot even start to wrap my head around it and looking online, I can't find a single soul who has gone through something like this.

I have no idea what to do. I'm so tired of feeling depressed and almost like a freak for having this happen to me and I feel like it's my fault even if my brain tells me that logically, an 11 year old never could have seen that coming. I feel guilty for living and I wish it would have been me. I also cannot understand how the justice system could be so cruel. I'm reminded of it constantly through news articles and what happened with Casey Anthony. It was like living it again.

I lost both my grandparents on Christmas Eve.

On Thursday the 25th, I lost my last living grandparent.

How do I get better if things keep getting worse? My depression has spiraled ever since my emergency surgery back in December due to a very severe case of an ectopic pregnancy. I almost lost my life (now I wish I did lose my life) and just two weeks after, my grandparents died due to a murder/suicide. How can I remove that memory/thought from my head? Everyday I keep imaging what happened and how it happened and how my entire family reacted to the news on Christmas eve... How do I keep pushing forward when everything that has happened has set me back? I feel lost and I feel incomplete and I feel anxious from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. Nothing I do or nothing my husband does for me makes me feel any better. I lack any desire to work, any desire to get dressed, any desire to be awake, any desire to even put on pants. I want to sleep 24/7 and even after sleeping for hours at a time, I am still tired, I am still depressed, I am still anxious, I am still sad... After everything that has happened, it has made me feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. I don't feel motivated or inspired to do anything and I feel like I have completely failed at life. I feel like a failure. I don't even have the self esteem or self confidence to assure myself that I am not any of that, that I am not a failure or that I didn't fail at life. I feel so useless, ugly, disgusting, upset, drained, exhausted, unmotivated, betrayed ... I could go on. I feel like my husband doesn't love me after all I've been through, I feel like he resents me for all that has happened, I feel like he just says things to me because he thinks it'll help me heal but I can't help but that think he's done with me, he's had enough of me, he doesn't love me anymore.

I wrote about how my day and my life has become mechanical and how my only solace was my boyfriend whose 'welcome home hug' gave me some semblance of warmth and love. Soon after we adopted my beautiful cat baby. Me and my boyfriend recently broke up where he stated that I had become fat, unattractive and had no hobbies and how because of this he was driven to like someone else. I tried to keep the breakup amicable in hopes that I would occasionally see my baby boy whom I couldn't get with me due to several issues. I realised the symptoms back then but I never acted on it or seeked help. When I told my now ex about this that my lack of motivation and my inability to see things through could be because of my depression, he laughed and told me that he will only believe me if it's confirmed by a professional. I switched jobs, changed cities for a while, and did everything possible to change this feeling. But I'm still feeling lost in life. I don't know where to go and what direction to take for my career. My only anchor to happiness is now gone including my baby cat whom I love like a mother would love her child. I miss both of them every day and I can't seem to find a break from this deep pit of depression. My career is going nowhere. Nor is all the weight that I've accumulated over the past 2-3 years.

Over the course of 4 years of my relationship, I have even developed self worth issues (as stated by my therapist) and impostor syndrome at work. I try to do new things but I'm unable to continue doing them. I've lost interest in work, health, hobbies, everything. I feel suicidal at times too.

524;Please help. I can't fix my life alone.;3;biq48x;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biq48x/please_help_i_cant_fix_my_life_alone/;3;2019-04-29 11:29:25;"Hello everybody, I'm an 18 year old male currently studying architecture as a first year student in university. I have not been diagnosed with any sort of depressive disorder (yet) and I do not take any prescribed medicine at the time of writing this.

My reason of posting here is that I feel my life is falling to a slow decline. I've felt this way since around early 2017, and the decline has gotten to the point where **out of 8 of my university assignments due within the first 10 weeks, I've only completed and handed in 1.**

I don't know. This seemingly evergrowing depression has caused me to lose my sense of urgency ever since. Additionally it has also crept to affect my urgency for other responsibilities, motivation towards personal achievements, will to socialise with people, and littler things like my elocution, spelling and even my personal hygeine. Sometimes I go days without brushing my teeth or leaving my room because there is not a single urge in me to go and do it, let alone anything to convince me that I care anymore.

I believe this started due to my late high school life. I've proven to show high academic potential before (particularly in maths) so I was constantly pressured by my father, teachers and classmates to graduate with flying colours, on top of the sudden change in lifestyle and work amounts transitioning from Year 10 to Year 11, I couldn't do it anymore. I drowned in people's expectations, and one by one I witnessed my life crumbling apart slowly, for example going from borderline completing my schoolwork, to doing half of it, to not doing it at all. And for other things it only got worse from there.

As far as treatment goes I usually tend to binge on old YouTube videos, play old flash games, listen to Nightcore, meaningless things that I do only for the purpose of ""overdosing"" on nostalgia, when things were simpler, easier; when things were actually in order. I always dream of back when I behaved absolutely carefree and upbeat, which I still I do only for the sake of convincing myself that I'm really like that.

I have however never seeked profressional treatment, in fact I am afraid to as my father has never viewed me as anything other than a disappointment and already complains that I'm sucking too much money out of his wallet for chiropractic care (I have a poor posture and lower back, which could contribute to my condition). This is actually my first time telling anybody about this (which I highly regret), because unlike a measly essay for homework in high school that I didn't do, we're talking about 7 incomplete university assignments here, so I simply must since my future is at risk.

All I ask for is a little support. Any tips or advice to help me get back on track. Even anything obvious which I am most likely missing. I am not seeking an overly large text like this one, because I already feel selfish enough asking for help, setting myself up for failure, disappointing my dad, etc. I am already taking few measures to help alleviate my condition, like exercising every evening (which also helps with my bad posture), actively seeking employment and I plan on seeing my university's counsellor sometime this week.

If you've made it this far then it's still comforting to know that somebody took their time to read about my problems. And of course, thank you very much!

She seems to care about her image, she will be in the bad spotlight, and regrets raising me this way. She says that if she raised me more authoritatively I would have been more meek or I would have done everything she wanted. This really disturbed me. I opened myself before her this year and she has no sympathy for my mental health.  Each time I talk with my parents they see me as a failure, I do not want to open more.

I can't tell if I'm depressed, anxious, something else, or just telling myself that I am to avoid responsibility for my own shortcomings.  I can't tell if, when I talk to my fiance about it, I'm actually trying to communicate my feelings or if I'm just trying to get her to feel sorry for me, and overlook my mistakes or faults.  Maybe I just want her to take care of me, so I don't have to take care of myself.  I don't THINK I'm faking it, because I try to be honest, but I FEEL like I'm at least playing it up for sympathy points.

&#x200B;

We both work in mental health.  She's getting her masters, and I'm just starting out as a low level support guy, but the more I hear about things like borderline disorders, or the clinical definitions of things like sociopathy, the more convinced I am that I'm one of those, but just denying it.  And she's in the perfect position to find me out and leave me.  She'll find out that I'm a selfish piece of shit, even though I constantly try to prove that I'm not, but why would I need to prove it if I weren't?  I don't know if I really even believe in all the mental illnesses I work with every day, or if I only go along with it because I can use them to justify my own laziness or selfishness or childishness. I don't know.  I think I know, but I just don't.

&#x200B;

That's the whole crux of it, I think. I don't know if I'm really feeling what I think I am or if I'm just a selfish, narcissistic, manipulative asshole.  If I sleep too long, and can't get up, am I depressed, or do I want her to think I'm depressed so she'll coddle me?  If I freak out about money or change, am I being anxious, or just selfish?  Sometimes, I don't even know if I love her. I mean, I KNOW that I do, because she makes me happy, she makes me feel loved and cared for, and I smile every time I see her.  I KNOW that I love her, full stop.  But there's this piece of shit part of me that feels like I'm only doing it because I want to feel loved, or taken care of, or even because I want someone that I can take care of and feel needed. I'm just a self serving fuck who doesn't really care about anyone else.  I fucking hate it.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't even know if I'm just writing this post so that someone will just pity me and say it's all okay and normal. Of course, I do want someone to sympathize, I think that's normal, but what if I just want someone to tell me it's not my fault, and all of my problems are real and I don't have to blame myself for them.  When I edit sentences I told myself it was to clarify what I mean, but also I feel like I'm only doing it to make sure none of it sounds like I'm REALLY a sociopath so all of you will be sure to tell me that I'm fine and I just need a hug.  Or maybe it's the other way around and I fixed my grammar and told myself I'm a narcissistic piece of shit, but I really just want someone to understand me.

&#x200B;

I just don't know, and I think it's breaking me.  Or I just want upvotes and karma and sympathy. I don't know.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text, but I needed it off my chest.  Does anyone know what this feels like?  Does anyone relate?  Does anyone want to just call me on my bullshit and tell me to be a better person?  Do the former, but *secretly think* the latter, probably?

I have made progress over the years but the loneliness and boredom is crushing me where I am now. I really need someone to talk to.

My brain is all over the place. I'm coming up to a breaking point. I cried myself to sleep last night. I need to keep trying, I don't want to succumb to misery. I want to work on myself but the isolation is crushing me. I'm on my own all day, 5 days a week, it's killing me.

Basically I've been depressed since I started high school, I stopped attending school on a regular basis, would just stay home in bed, I managed to scrape by and get into university, but haven't successfully moved past this pattern of behaviour, I spent the 9 months I moved away for university in my dorm room in bed mainly, I dropped out, came home, spent years at home either in bed or going out partying (which helped in a lot of ways, I found amazing friends, more confidence, the community of friends to feel like I had a real home in this city, eventually I met my boyfriend as well who I now live with who is very supportive financially and emotionally).

After a couple years at home, I did get my current job, it's a gig job, it was a bit more stable then, but I just got it because it was a job and my plan was to build up slowly with it, till I felt better, then when I felt better I could think about university again (or whatever other game plan). I put off moving in with my boyfriend for ages because I wanted to be able to support myself financially, or at least know I could do regular hours, I had saved up some plus I was doing regular hours when I did move in with him, but have barely been working for a year or so now, burned through my savings, relying on him and family now. But I did build up with work slowly, to working around 25-30 hours regularly plus volunteering (which kind of took over my life for a couple years), but then I couldn't handle it, I stopped communicating with anyone in the volunteer organisation, I was working less and less and then my contract changed for much worse so even less work, for even less money... 

I found a vocational course that I've been doing for the last few months, it broke for Easter and restarting tomorrow, I enjoy it but for now it's only two half days a week, for the next eight weeks. I'm so bored not doing anything full time but I'm so scared that I can't handle it. I'm thinking about applying for whatever bar work or temp jobs for short term but really struggling with the motivation and discipline to actually apply. I'm not completely unskilled but I get so awkward with people the more lonely and depressed I am, so it can be really anxiety-inducing. I'm also thinking about other volunteer roles, there's one in particular I'd love to apply for that sounds well-trained and well-structured (something that I think would be excellent for me, I flounder without structure), I need the moral support on this, my boyfriend is great, I do have good friends and family but of course everyone has their lives and work and then here I am thinking thinking thinking on my own going batshit!

I know to some extent I need to kick my ass into gear, but I need some understanding, some solidarity, I need to know I'm not alone, not just the tough love guilt-inducing thoughts of needing to shape up and be a real adult. I do a lot of thinking to try to be kind to myself, to forgive myself, I have done a lot of work on that. I do tell myself the ways that I am trying and maturing and how I feel more and more ready to step up and do the daily grind, how I want to be a reliable and stable person. I've made big steps in my communication as a partner, in my relationships with family and friends, in keeping my house clean, tidy, and nicely decorated, my diet, making nice healthy, even creative, meals for us, I make efforts to exercise but struggle with the consistency, same with efforts of just getting out of the house, I try to come up with things like I'll try walk partway with my boyfriend when he goes to work, also meditation, taking better care of my appearance... So I do try, the consistency is of course the difficult part, ultimately the biggest problem is getting knocked back by the loneliness and isolation.

I'm trying to get back into my gig job, at least temporarily for discipline, self-esteem and cash, but it's low-paid, physically exerting (so it's difficult for me to pick up on and off if I'm laying around depressed most of the time), basically soul-destroying because I'm on my own all day with that too, staring at my phone all day.

I'm extremely online and sick of it, I feel addicted to the internet and I feel like it's terrible for my concentration. I do read/watch/play some things I think are worth doing on the internet, but it's way too much and my concentration is shot for reading books, talking to people, doing much of anything productive - it's the easiest procrastination device. And I feel like I have no willpower against procrastination.

I've had therapy over the years, the last therapist was the most consistent, but I stopped last year when my own money ran out. I could ask for help on paying for therapy, but I've lost a bit of hope with it for now. Also feel like the money could go better towards exercise classes, social outings, general living expenses.

Please help! Mainly just to to feel less alone and that I can work through this. I feel a bit better having typed this out. I'm so tired of feeling like I exist in a vacuum during the day while everyone else is at work. Sorry it's a bit jumbled, I mainly just wanted to get my thoughts out.

The more I try the more I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT MY FEELINGS people just give me weird faces and friends. No one likes me, I am of no importance to anyone in this life that I am living. 

I'm a Muslim, I have been raised a Muslim I don't talk to own nor do I interact with women aside from family, not everyone in my family is getti g loved marriage, I tried to talk to my mum about how it's not right for my sister to find someone through ""love"" my mum shot me down saying do you want a girlfriend now.

Anyways we started as friends that would sleep together every now and then. In the few months we did that she was kind of a bitch sometimes but I didn't though much of it because I didn't really cared much about her. We were just people that found each other attractive but didn't have much interest in each other, and I was ok with that. 

Well her birthday happend last week and I decided to take the next step and even got her flowers. I guess I though she would take it as a hint and take ""us"" more serious too (btw all her family thinks she should give me a chance) 

On the day of her birthday she was acting weird. She started by changing the time then canceling it altogether because she had anxiety. I tried to be supportive and told her that it was ok and that if she changed her mind to let me know. Well around 1 am she texts me asking me where I was and why I didn't went to her party. I saw her party on Snapchat but she never told me that it was on again so I didn't go, I mean, why go if I wasn't invited? 

Well it kinda hurt, but this is not unusual behavior of her and it didn't used to bother me cuz, tbh I didn't really cared much. It hurts now mainly because I let her in and started caring and, unconsciously, gave her more responsibility that she didn't ask for (ei. Considering my feelings). 

She hasn't texted me since yesterday and it feels weird. We used to talk everyday and send each other memes and funny videos and now it's 6 am and I can't stop thinking about her. Any advice?";FulliCullli

Put me in a financial hole and I got diagnosed with anxiety when I went in because I thought I was feeling depressed but my anxiety was so bad it was causing me to feel depressed and only going to work, and only work was what made me feel better. Which in turn made everything worse. My relationships were ending suddenly and abruptly with no explanations. Or it was me not you. But I started to realize it was me. So I stopped doin blow. I quit my job. And took a job that allowed me to move back to my hometown. Which helped significantly but brought on a new level of anxiety of its own.

I’ve known I had it. It started around the time I was 7 Yrs Old. I feel I am alone stuck in my head like prisoner if that makes any sense to you or you can relate. I tend to talk to myself and bring myself down because I feel I deserve it, I often drink alcohol or buy a bottle just to feel numb a bit and forget my problems. I can’t let go of my past a lot of the time and can’t seem to stop thinking of “what could’ve been”, “what I should’ve done differently”, “wishing I changed”, “regretting errors and mistakes I’ve done” etc. I think about everything. Sometimes I can be okay and start crying uncontrollably, it’s not probably my anxiety and panic attacks that cause me to react so.

My family knows I’m depressed and that I wanna die. Now as a depressed person we (depressed ppl) tend to wanna hide it and not let many know we feel suicidal. But one time during a family dinner the voices and thoughts in my head got to me and I lost it. I broke down, started yelling and crying saying “I wanna die, I’m done, I can’t anymore just STOP IT!!!”. My whole family stopped and had to hold down to calm me. Now they know but I still feel like they don’t care. 4 days ago I decided to speak with cousin about reoccurring nightmares I’ve had and started having again. I told him if we could drink a bit and talk he said “sure thing” I went to his room and we started chatting. I can’t tell you how much I regret talking to him about my problems all he said was “Their just nightmares, that’s it stop making it seem like your life is some kind of movie get over it” 

It’s weird ain’t it? They say “talk to someone” when your depressed, I did just that but all it did was make me feel worse. 

Does anyone els feel lonely? Like they need a hug.. but not just a hello hug, I mean like a good solid I care about you hug.

My depression and anxiety stem from my lack of self esteem, and I'm worried that will ruin our relationship. He's never had depression or anxiety, but he helps me get out of those ruts better than anyone else. 

I trust him with my life, so why can't I grasp the fact that someone could love me? Why do I feel like the only way to know is for him to tell me nice things about myself? I feel pathetic and needy.

I always look forward to free days, but whenever i have a day off i get reminded by how lonely i am. I'm socially a wreck and just find it so hard to make and maintain friendships. My enormous hate for myself makes it so hard for me to see why people would want to be friends with me.

I try to learn new stuff but I lose interest very fast. Informations will drift into nirvana, I can't really keep the informations.

I used to listen to music a lot, but I have lost the joy. I used to paint and draw a lot, lost the interest, tried a few times to find my motivation, failed - and then I threw everything away.

I used to be awake until 3, 4am and enjoyed so many video games. Now I discover the pattern of a game really fast. Guess what? I lose interest. 

I don't even want to commit suicide or something, because even that seems so boring to me. What if I kill myself and my soul is supposed to continue this boring loop forever???? 

I have lost interest in everything.
Every day is so damn boring. Everything that I do, my goals, spending time with my SO, being with friends and family, everything became so boring. My mind constantly tries to find a sense in life. I can't even relax anymore, I would just lay down bored asf. 

It's not the 'I am bored. I'm going to meet new people, travel, watch a movie, play video games' - bored. It's the constant feeling of losing interest in everything. The struggle to find something that gives life a little meaning. The 'fuck I am losing my mind' - kind of bored.";flying_Cake

I'd estimate that around 85 % of the time I'm miserable and struggle to feel good even about great things happening - getting a job, excellent grades, parties etc -, but most days I'll have at least a few good moments when I'll feel happy and become convinced that I've just been a whiny loser and need to pull myself together.

I have always suffered from social anxiety and turned to alcohol and drug use to ease that.  I am never really sad but more so flat and have 0 motivation to do anything.  I rarely go to class as a result and take very poor care of myself.  As a result, my grades, physical and mental health, and social life have suffered immensely.  I have been suspended and taken time off from school for a total of 2 years (once for mental health and once for drug use) causing me to only be a 1st semester junior at the age of 22.  I thought I was finally in the clear starting this year but was then diagnosed with colitis which caused my health to further deteriorate.  I ended up dropping 40 lbs since august (wasnt a big person to begin with) and I am back to my old habits of not going to class and my mental state is at an all time low.  I am on track to fail this semester and have no prospects for a summer job or internship.  I've spent the better part of 3 months sleeping all day, browsing the internet all night, and making any excuse I can to justify my situation and actions.  I know that my lifestyle is wrong and unhealthy but I can't seem to do anything about it.  I haven't told my parents yet because of my past struggles and I am afraid this might put them over the edge.  They have always been very understanding but I feel like this will only put more stress on them and I dont want to feel like a bigger burden than I already do.  I have never felt more worthless than I have right now.  I have had so many opportunities and I have thrown them all away.  I feel like an embarrassment to my family and the few friends I do have.  Everyone of my friends is graduating this year as well and I am scared shitless of being even more alone next year (if there is one).  I have never seriously considered suicide due to the harm it would cause my family but at this point if I could just stop existing I would.

I've been suffering from depression for more that 8 years. My family has had a huge role to play in aggravating my depression. I'm the youngest of 4. My sisters (3) are all high achieving and successful in their academic lives. Day by day it seems that my parents have just become fed up with me. They express regret and distaste into anything and everything I do or say. I tried my best, I tried for 10 years to make them feel satisfied, to hear them say that they were proud of me or happy about the choices I'd made. 

What's most hurtful was that they were more supportive to my friend who is a topper in my class and always praising him and criticizing me publicly for not being able to do good. Recently I went on a competition with the guy and he lost his passport and I contracted Dysentry. My parents kept calling him and texting him asking about how his condition is or whether he needed anything or had his parents been informed. They didn't call me, they didn't text me. Not until they couldn't reach my topper friend.

I didn't do anything bad to anyone, I tried my best to be polite to people. My grades aren't that bad but not that great either. But time and again nobody, specially my family ever seemed to appreciate the effort I'd put in. I was always a disappointment to them.

I'm sorry for nagging all along about this, it's just, I only wanted someone to support me. In my sophomore year, I fell for a girl, she was my closest friend in my campus. I told her things I couldn't tell anybody else. Maybe that's why I fell for her hard. I went to India to attend a conference. The day after I get back,she tell me that she can't do it anymore. She can't be with me anymore. That I'm just a deal-breaker inside, nothing else. What hurt more is that she became close friends with a guy who she knew had a crush on him and gave him her entire attention. They'd go to the varsity together and come back together.

I'm not sure where I went wrong honestly. And I don't know why I am posting this here cause I've tried self journaling, I've tried writing down the things that hurt me the most but they never went away, nor did they decrease in the amount of pain they caused me.";Rageeb13

Always hanging out with random people, always working, always staying busy. but this month I realized that I didn't enjoy any of my distractors. I was giving my life away to people and things that didn't make me happy.

this week I wanted to try to change that. I unplugged for the week! I let myself stay inside, and only left when I absolutely wanted/had to.
I was alone with myself more than I've ever been, and faced myself head-on for the first time.
It went way better than expected.
I guess it's that I wasn't surrounding myself with people and situations that make me feel inadequate. I had moments of random self-loathe, but it was nothing good snacks and games couldn't fix.

599;My Life;3;binb8k;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/binb8k/my_life/;6;2019-04-29 06:02:47;"This is my story:

I go to one of the most competitive high schools in the Bay Area. I get good grades,  play sports, clubs, you name it. I keep a smile on my face through it all. Nobody knows what actually goes on. My mother committed suicide when I was 8 and suffered with schizophrenia. My father is an abusive cunt who has been arrested on numerous occasions for being violent and neglectful. He doesn't work, and just sits home all day drinking. I am currently in foster care because of him. I have been in foster care twice before. He has never been receptive to any parenting classes or family therapy that was court-ordered. I think this is the last straw. I'm done with him.

Last September, he punched me so hard I sustained a concussion. I pushed through recovery believing I had to survive for my own sake, and I couldn't risk going back to foster care. The previous home I was in was dreadful. The family was Christian and kept forcing me to get baptized and did everything they could to change every part of me. I hated myself so much because of this. I know i'm a bit weird, but I like being unique, you know? If that wasn't enough, the foster dad molested me. I hope he drops the soap and gets raped in jail. Fucking pathetic excuse for a human being. Anyways-getting beaten is ok compared to being molested.

I thought I just needed to focus on school. So, I did that. But things just kept getting worse at home. More beating, yelling, punching. I simply can't take the abuse anymore. My body can't handle it. I am bruised and hurting on the daily. Most people believe this is just disciplinary methods that any sane parent would use to control their teen. But no- my dad beats me just because he's angry. I'm not even a wild teen. I don't party or do stupid shit. In fact, I am very far from a normal teen. I don't have any friends because it is so hard to open up and trust people after going through what I have gone through early in my life. I believe I might actually have Asperger's or something. Most foster kids are deranged drug-addict misfits. I am a misfit, but in a different way.

If there is one goal I have, it is to go to college. Only 3% of foster youth graduate college! With these odds against me, however,  I am determined to succeed. I would love to attend UC Berkeley, as many of my pure early childhood memories with my mom were there.  Currently, my grades look pretty well. However, I am concerned about my Chemistry Honors grade. I got a C last semester because I didn't realize this course would be so difficult. This semester, I'm doing better. I have a 87.5% in the class. As the end of the year is approaching, I hope to pull an A. If I succeed, I will have a estimated UC GPA of 4.2. I really messed up freshman year b/c of that whole foster home fiasco, but the UC system doesn't count freshman grades. Thank God! Most of the kids at my school ,I have noticed, are superficial vapid spoiled bitches. With their JUULs, AirPods, MacBooks. They have had EVERYTHING handed to them on a silver platter. Meanwhile, i'm working until I collapse day and night just so that I might not fall into the cracks. They get tutoring, SAT prep, a stable home environment, supportive rich parents, they BS through classes with cheating. They take all of this for granted. It sickens me. I work double time. I do everything they're doing and all on my own: cook, clean, study, work and save money for college. I feel 45 but i'm just 15.

I lie awake every night crying to myself. If I don't get an A in Chem, I need a 35 on the ACT to compensate. How will I possibly manage that? I have no academic support. How do I even do this on my own? I feel like i'm constantly drowning. How could I possibly afford college? Am I genuinely insane trying to be so ambitious? I have never heard of anyone ever going through something like this. I found some scholarships. One meant for foster care could take care of $100,000. I found a few more I qualify for. But still idk.

1. Tell (x) about depression
2. ""Oh its ok, I don't mind helping""
3. They see how destructive depression can really be
4. ""Oh shit, this person is really depressed, I better avoid them""

I don't expect everyone to have the tools to deal with a depressed friend or family member. It's not an easy thing to deal with, I understand that. But I'm just really baffled by how many people are caught off guard by how dark depression can really be. Has depression been so romanticized and normalized that people are expecting something completely different when they try to help? All of this makes it incredibly hard for people to be open about their struggles.

I've struggled with depression since I was about 10 years old (obviously with less severity). This semester I transferred to a new college and I have been struggling. I knew things were getting bad at the beginning of the semester but I couldn't seek counseling because we didn't have health insurance and I didn't want to put that burden on my mom. A month ago, I finally saw a therapist and have been working with her every other week, which isn't enough frankly, but she doesn't have enough availability. I am struggling. I have had terrible insomnia since the second week of classes, my anxiety is skyrocketing, and I feel so hopeless. Last year I got all A's and B's in my classes, this year, I'll be lucky if I pass more than 2. I can't tell my mom I'm failing, but it's getting so bad. It's too late for a medical withdraw and if I did that my mom would know. I feel so guilty for making her pay thousands of dollars in tuition and $1K  a month on living expenses for me, and I know I'll get in trouble, but I just want to cry.

They treat me like their kid, mainly because their kid is my best friend, basically my brother almost, to an extent, but we'll get back to that part. But everything seemed great from the outside, I don't pay for rent, they make very good money, and have nice things. After about 6 months of living in that, I started to feel stagnant, like I am doing nothing, mainly because I am but it feels so mundane, all I do is work, game, sleep too little, repeat. I don't hardly leave my room much any more. That stems from why it feels so bad here now. I am so uncomfortable living in these other peoples house, I don't even like going to the kitchen. This has dragged on for 2 years now and I think within the last probably 6 months, I've started to see bad signs of depression, I feel it, the weight pulling on me so hard to make everything negative. I hate this feeling so much and I'm scared.   

I think the only way for me to get better is to get out of this place, get my own place, and start being independent, but I'm so scared to leave and run into financial problems. That's why I haven't done it yet. 

Recently I met this girl, and I can't stop thinking about her, she is fantastic. We both know we have feelings, but even though I'm 19, she already has 2 kids at 24. It isn't the most glamorous situation between us, we've talked about it and I want to be with her so bad, because I want something to look forward to, someone I can just see or think about and smile about it. She has told me she can't involve me into her and her kids life until I get my own together. I can almost borderline say I love her. I want everything to do with her. But I don't want to mess this whole thing up. So she is a motivation for me to get this all together but even with that, my depression still is trying to tear my legs down so I can step up in my life. I doubt myself so much, but I want to change my life for this girl, not be the negative person I am for her. Get my own freedom for her.

If you got this far, I greatly appreciate it, I just need someone to talk to outside of my life honestly so I can see it unbiasedly, I'd love to hear what you think. Thanks

I was super into it, loved it overall. Only problem is I can't remember anything about the movie except for C.M herself, some guy and a cat. I remember nothing else. No plot details. I don't even remember what the whole journey of the story is. My brain has like blocked an entire memory. I was totally awake and fully sober when I watched it, but yet don't remember anything?

This has been the biggest example so far of what I'm assuming is some form of mental blockage/memory loss, but I forget things all the time and causes me to develop OCD-like behaviours. For example, I will forget if I've turned the oven off, and I'll go back to check. Then I'll head to my room and do the exact same thing 5 minutes later. 

On top of these weird episodes, I also feel like my hearing is being affected. Quite often, I will only hear half of what someone next to be is saying, and I'll often mishear what I hear. On the opposite of the scale, sometimea I'll be able to hear a tiny sound from a long distance that no one else can hear.

“Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have but I have it” by Lana Del Rey- the title explains it all; I’ve been miserable the past couple years, but I’m headed to grad school this fall, so I’m hoping I can change things for the better

“Get Free” by Lana Del Rey- especially  when she sings “I wanna move out of the black into the blue”; I interpret that as overcoming the lowest point of depression (black) and moving into a milder form of it (blue). Not a great situation, but an improvement nonetheless.

“Black Wave/ Bad Vibrations” by Arcade Fire- I relate to this a LOT, as I am moving to another country for grad school, hoping to “run from the memories” and leave my emotional baggage at the airport

“Here Comes the Night Time II” by Arcade Fire- I feel like it captures the feeling of isolation you get as night falls and you’re either alone or (perhaps worse) feeling lonely in a crowd of people socializing and having a good time

“Pocketful of Sunshine” by Natasha Bedingfield- I know it’s cheesy, but it gives me hope

“No tears left to cry” by Ariana Grande- another cheesy one. Last year I had my heart broken for the first time. I hit rock bottom and spent 2018 crying so much that I had to use eye drops because my eyes were too dry for contacts without them. This year I’m literally out of tears to cry, so I have no choice but to pick myself up and heal.";anonymous123321456

My life so far has been an interesting ride since I could first remember. The best place to start is from the beginning, I'm 15, I'm from Pennsylvania I've been moving around from town to town pretty much my whole life so I cant really call anywhere my 

When I was a kid (ages 3-8) I've been a happy kid everything in my life seemed fine. I didnt have any friends I mostly kept to myself and I was fine with that. I was able to occupy myself and have fun playing and doing whatever I was doing at my age.

When I grew up is when things started to take a nasty turn (around 3rd grade) I was a natural target for bullying being the weird kid who came in from nowhere. It wasnt anything targeted just general repulsion at my entire being. I being a pretty much socially underdeveloped kid thought my classmates were just messing with me and that's how friends interacted. 4th grade was when I met my pretty much only friend. His named was Bradley and we met after being forced to take recess of together. We discussed pretty much our love of video games and started talking on the regular. This lasted all the way up till elementary graduation.

Middleschool. The absolute tipping point into a dark hole of nothing but absolute shit. Went into 5th grade feeling pretty confident. I was hoping to make new friends and enjoy being a kid. The university it seems had other plans for me (it was at this point my home life as I had known it was going to get absolutely fucked but more on that later) I dont remember alot of I guess my brain tried to block most of it out but all I remember was being a constant outcast. I was always looked down upon and became a target of bullying and cheap laughs by everyone in that school. In that year though, I had managed to finally get a chance to talk to Bradley again and he introduced me to this little posse of friends that took him in. I wasnt generally accepted by anyone but Bradley but they atleast gave me a spot to sit at during lunch. Nothing really excited for that year except wake up, go to school, do work, get picked on, come home and repeat. 

6th grade turned out to be a little different. I had learned I was a naturally quick thinker and could think of pretty good (although dark and offensive) that gave everyone a good laugh. I was still disliked by pretty much everyone in the entire school, but the group I had become a part of started liking me more. I started hanging out with this one kid Brogan and he was a pretty good friend even if we did dumb things together. At this point I was basically a catalyst for a quick laugh, people would ask me to do dumb things and I would happily oblige due to wanting to fit in. I repeatedly got into trouble and this of course came to bite me in the ass next year. Besides that life carried on like that for the rest of the year just having that small group of friends and being semi liked.

This is probably where I should intervene and describe my home life and the main source of my youthful depression and suicidal thoughts. (Sorry I'm not good at organizing). My mom is an open lesbian and had dated a girl when I was younger. But she met this one girl. Her name was jess and I absolutely hate her with all my heart. She came when I was in 4th grade and from the get go she made my life miserable. You see jess was a grade-A narcissist. She had no feelings, everything had to be about her and was overall a general awful human being. You see one common thing with narcissists and kids is they pick one to absolutely praise and spoil and one to essentially turn into a scapegoat. She had chosen my sister as the praised one and I turned out to be the scapegoat. Now since I was a kid I thought this source of punishment had to be my fault and I deserved it. It wasnt anything too bad just finding some dumb excuse to take my playstation. Around a year later however I guess jess picked up a little meth habit. It didnt change any of her personalities just amplified her already horrible demeanor. It had progressed from taking away my playstation to insulting my appearance and making snide comments about my lack of social life. I had told my mom about the little emotional abuse at home but she constantly worked and never believed me because the reasons I had always given her for my punishments although true sounded dumb because they were so she assumed I was lying. Halfway through my 6th grade my mom had gotten her shifts changed and was able to spend most of the day at home. This is where my mental health started to severely decline. Jess was never physically abusive to me but my mom on the other hand was a different story. Their fights had always been intense but were far a few and were verbal only. But around this point she had started to hit my mom and push her around. I regret to admit I had done nothing at this time to intervene as I was afraid I'd be hit next. This continued for a few months until it declined even farther. It turned around one day when I heard their bedroom door slam and thought ""oh great theres going to be a fight"" well lo and behold the screaming started immediately. This was a daily occurence so I did what I always did, earbuds in music up. Well around 5 minutes later I feel a loud thump and the house shook, I immediately flew to their door and threw it open what I saw absolutely horrified me. There was my mom on the floor with jess on top of her with her hands around my moms throat screaming ""now you're gonna die!"" ""Now you're gonna die!"". I guess my mom had saw me and screamed ""go!"". This distracted jess and allowed my mom to grab her and throw her off. 

After that day the fights seemed to grow worse. Everyday they fought on a verbal and physical level. Each time resulting in my mom beaten and she did nothing about it. Actually scratch that she did, mom had picked up on meth herself and that's when she completely lost herself. This happened around my 7th year in school and was generally my best, most of the school thought I was funny and enjoyed being around me. Although none of the girls did they still insulted me and made me feel awful about myself. I find this ironic because what should've been the best year became my worst because of my home life. My mom had started both verbally and physically abusing me. Meth had destroyed her mentally and even now she doesnt remember any of it. It was worse from her because she knew me well and knew how to attack all of my insecurities (and speaking from having been on both sides emotional abuse for me was worse) she didnt need a reason to attack me everything in her sick mind was somehow justified. Everyday she would hit and somehow every new day it was in a more painful way. One situation that stands out the most went like this, I'm in a towel having just gotten out of the shower and my mom comes up to me. ""Thanks for eating all the brownies last night fat ass"" me having taken no brownies said ""I didnt touch any of the brownies"" the response I get was a sarcastic ""mhm sure"" out of snarky instinct i responded with ""whatever"" next thing i knew my mom had grabbed a fistful of my hair (having it being decently long) and slammed me into the wall and started smacking me in the face. 


Back in school I somehow became a target of my teachers aswell due to my history of being rebellious and a troublemaker in 6th grade. The social studies teacher who was filling in for the vice principal since he was away due to a failing immune system hated me. It got to the point where he would just blame things I had no correlation with on me. If I was within 50 ft of an incident it was automatically my fault. Well all those punishments caught up with me and they kicked me out to a behavioral school. I must've been the only person to have 26 after school detentions, 8 Saturday detentions, 16 lunch detentions 45 days of in school suspension and 13 days of out of school detention. 

Around this time is when I started regularly looking for ways to take my own life, I just couldn't take it anymore. The behavioral school wasnt bad there were 3 of us and we all worked on computers since they didnt have a 7th grade class until I came there so they threw one together quickly. I finish up the last 5 months of school and summer came around

This summer as I can say was the time of my life the abuse at home hadn't relented, in fact it got worse but I was able to get put of the house more. I'd stay out as long as I could I had a curfew at 11 but If didnt come home I'd be locked out, I didnt care I slept outside and had a blast. I started hanging out with this one guy Dylan every day and we would walk around town and talk and smoke. This lasted for about 3 weeks until shit hit the fan. Jess had become increasingly unstable till the point of even just hurting herself in her anger. My mom had become self aware and started seeing jess for who she was. One day the kitchen door closed and I thought ""oh great another fight"" now since this was going on for years I had a system of stay near the room, knife in one hand 911 on dial in the other, pop in after a few minutes and ask ""did anyone else hear that long bang?"" To let jess know that I was listening and I would intervene. Well I hear a loud bang and I kick open the door to see jess just punching my mom repeatedly i screamed something along the lines of ""get the fuck off my mom!"" And jess turns towards me and charges towards me and almost hit me before she could my mom grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and told me to go out find a phone and call the police (since my phone had been smashed a month prior) I ran out used a neighbors phone and they came. We got a pfa on jess and mom said she had one week to get her stuff and get out of her house. Everything seemed like they were going to get better until 3 days later. My sister knocked on my door and said ""hey cops are here we have 30 mins to grab our stuff and leave because were getting evicted"" I was shocked I grabbed what I could and I had no idea how jess was able to get us out of our own house that my mom paid for until a year later. Here jess had gone to a courthouse and said that we were her kids, everything in the hose was hers and mom wasnt letting her in the house. The fucking retarded judge without doing any sort of research goes ""ok eviction time"". We weren't even supposed to get 30 mins the cop just knew mom and allowed us to get our essentials. Mom ended up finding a hotel to rent and I opted to stay behind as I dont like hotels and I thought I could find a place to stay. I didnt and i ended up sleeping outside and i watched as jess her mom and one of her friends spent 2 days taking out all of our stuff and burning it. We lost everything sentimental all baby pictures of me and my sisters all of my baby stuff basically anything that was of emotional value.

After 2 days of that my mom comes back from the hotel in the car of her one friend. His name was tom and he offered us a place to stay. I get in go to his house and immediately hated it. It was this small trailer that was covered in black mold and just generally falling apart. This is when I started talking to my now ex girlfriend at the time. She was my saving grace if she hadn't been around I wouldn't have made it a month into that. (To be honest her and this one girl marissa had basically saved my life as before when I living with jess if I hadn't reached out I would've taken my own life). Things were pretty bad there too but in a different way. My mom had gotten clean and was recovering. We lived in a rural area about a 2 hour walk from the nearest town. Since jess had keyed and totaled her car and tom worked most hours and wouldn't let us use the car we were basically dirt poor. Any money we got was from my dads child support and it wasnt alot anout 180$ and even then wouldn't pay the full thing sometimes so any money we did have went straight to food which tom ate instantly. He would eat 100$ worth of food in 3 days leaving us with nothing. It got better once we got food stamps and it helped is out alot but we still just couldn't get enough money together for a house. This went on for almost 3 years. Around 3 months ago my ex was being distant always cancelling time to hang out (because I need a ride from her mom). I eventually had enough walked 3 hours to where she lived we hung out and that's when I found out she was texting another guy telling him how much she loved him. I was with her for 1 year and a half and I was head over heels for her. We weren't perfect but I should've known something was up when she would get mad if I questioned her guy friends but I wasnt allowed to have girl friends. But even still I listened and pretty much cut out the 2 people who actually were my friend. After I broke up with her I was devastated she was my everything. Tom had been gone for around 7 weeks we got an eviction notice due to the trailer being deemed unfit for living we managed to get a house but it feels like nothing has changed. No one in my age range lives around here so I still have no friends, we still have no car so I cant get driven anywhere, and were still dirt poor. I feel like I'm a hole that just keeps getting deeper I'm trying to reach out but it's hard everyone would rather spend time with their other friends who live closer. I haven't felt this awful since middleschool It honestly feels like being dead would be a better option, suicide crosses my mind everyday I feel trapped and I have no idea what to do.";SpaghettiCunt88

Just some ignorable headaches and moodiness, nothing that took away from school. 

I'm doing okay off them (not depressed but feeling very off-kilter) and have considered staying off them but I don't trust my brain to stay stable without them and my depression is the ""active"" type aka a constant suicide risk. So I want to go back on them now that it's refilled and it's summer break and any side effects I may feel won't be public.

I'm just unsure if I should take the same amount as before or start with less? And getting an appointment to my doctor is just insane so not going to bother waiting a month to talk to her about it. It would be great to get medical advice but it's not happening. I'm thinking maybe going with one pill (25mg) for a certain time period, two for a period until I get back up to four (100mg). Or would it be better to just go back to what I was at right away?

I'm just not sure what to Google or where to ask, I suppose most people go off their antidepressants on purpose and don't want to go back or have an easier time going to their doctor. Anybody else go through this, and what did you do?";ebec20

620;Deprived from love at a young age;4;bimsqd;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bimsqd/deprived_from_love_at_a_young_age/;0;2019-04-29 04:41:40;"I grew up in a country that i am not originally from with parents who were as new to the culture as i was hence there was already a culture difference to which i had to struggle with in my younger years. I would usually encounter difference in opinion and virtues in school and home and this was pretty hard for me especially as my parents didn't know how society and people socialized here.
The notion of going out to a bar and hanging around friends late at night has been something very alien to them hence i was already starting to be secluded from my peers.

The notion of love is also something of a taboo. I can't even remember the last time they told me they loved me and i'm 22 years old. You could say that my emotional side has been neglected from my childhood to now where i am suffering such consequences of not feeling loved nor appreciated. I feel that such a thing has made me into a sort of needy person and someone who at times cannot believe it when people come say hi or even want me for something.

I have perhaps tried making up for this neglection by looking for it from girls in college but i did not have any luck with that either and this has consumed my thoughts whenever i do something and it makes me really sad when i think about it.
I love my parents as they have sacrificed a lot for me but till this day whenever i talk to them about feeling sad or hinting that i want even the most simple of affection from them like a hug, they always downplay my situation and although i try not to show any signs of sadness in front of them, it really hurts me inside as i was neglected such a thing since a young age especially as i was bullied which makes it even worse.
I have tried looking up online for a solution and one of things i found that intrigued my attention was that at times people look for things in others that they were neglected from having and i can see similarities with that since i have been trying to find this love from women in my college and i could see where this opinion comes from.

I always try not to feel sorry for myself because it really isn't going to change anything but at times i just can't help myself.";Notchi79

ive been depressed— or atleast very anxious, since 5th grade. i don’t know if this is how most people with clinical depression experience it or if im bipolar or have some kind of mood disorder. id say im in a pretty bad state for a month, feel good for about a week or so, and go back to suffering even when i think just maybe ill be happy.

anyway, with all that out of the way, i just need to vent because im not doing so good. i have felt this bad in a while, having pretty bad heart palpitations aswell. im suicidal, crying, and extremely lonely. im homeschooled and have 2 friends who i can’t hang out with due to long distance. i hate everyone else and can’t stand talking to people, i panic and get jumpy and usually have to excuse myself to cry. i have people on snapchat, sometimes i get so desperate for anyone to talk to me ill post anything on my story for attention except my feelings or anything of that sort, usually just jokes and hope someone will find it funny and swipe up. no one texts me, usually. i have suicidal thoughts a lot, for no particular reason i’d say. i relapsed yesterday, was clean of self harm for over a year but i fucked it all up.

And it blew up in my face today. I broke down simply because I was left alone to do all the work for half an hour with no warning. I lost it, and just said fuck it and went to the back to do dishes and cried about how much I hate myself and my life despite having everything I need to be happy.

 I can't stand that I need to take some stupid fucking pills every day for the rest of my life to keep myself from self destructing.  I want to be like normal people that can just feel motivated by simply living without the need of a forced injection of happy pills. I'm falling behind in school because I just can't feel motivated to do any homework or study. My best friend is so far ahead of me now that it hurts to even look at my school work. I keep telling myself to just do the work, and you'll feel better. But then I forget my pills, and boom. I'm a mess that gets sent home early because he breaks down over a little stress. 

&#x200B;

Depression is keeping me away from everything I want. I want to finish college and get a job I feel validated and important in. I want a relationship with someone that wont freak out when depression strikes. I want to simply enjoy the life I have. But I feel like I physically can't. If I don't take a stupid pill every day for the rest of my life. I'm nothing.

You see stories about shitty business practices by companies such as nestle, screwing over completely innocent mothers with false information and essentially sentencing babies to death for a couple extra dollars.

People who hurt innocent bystanders for no other reason than they wanted a power trio or they were mildly inconvenienced.

You see people who have been completely isolated from society because they were the local punching bag for society, because they dared to be vulnerable.

You see people dismissing horrible abuse towards innocent pets because “its just a cat, it doesn’t matter” or people telling you to ignore domestic abuse because “it’s not your problem”.  Blaming victims of violence or abuse, because “they were asking for it”

Obviously  this is a lot less serious but it’s also depressing to see groups of people like r/sadcringe seem to be unnecessarily cruel to the people featured. It’s actually kind of upsetting to see people picking on people who’s only crime was having no friends or enjoying something harmless but a little weird.


All I can ask is, why? Why do people feel the need to act like this? It’s just kind of depressing to think about.

Now I am a cashier at a museum gift shop and all my boss cares about is how fast I work.  I try to work on my own projects at home, but all I can manage to do is construct stuff in my head, and then to my horror, I realize weeks have gone by and I have done nothing.

To make matters worse, I was unemployed literally for years despite having an MA degree (which means I have over 100k in student loan debt which I will *never* be able to pay off).  Now I only work part time, and my employer wants to cut my hours (and thus my pay) by 57%.  I would quit, but I know I would just end up unemployed for years more.  Naturally, I kept on applying for better jobs in my field but although I got many interviews, I was never hired.  I was rejected over and over and over again.

I have never had a girlfriend, and I am 35 years old.

I am still a young man, but I feel my life is already over, and I am trapped in a nightmare which I cannot wake up from, and no amount of struggle or effort can free me from the situation.

But another question is the mood swings... my therapist hints at bipolar as well. Did y’all experience mood swings? Like at night you’ll feel dark and cold and depressed. Or you feel easily agitated on some days. Like some days are good and bad but never happy, just neutral and peaceful if it was a good day. Is this normal? Is this the downsides of adhd? Some days I feel social af but lately I’ve been pushing people away without even noticing. It’s been hard to keep in touch with anyone unless they hit me up and I feel awful.

I (23f) am undiagnosed but I am definitely depressed and have been for most of my post-puberty life. I've recently also been having some anxiety issues (physical symptoms, panic attacks, etc). I am mature enough now to realize that I can no longer suffer in silence and just hope that it all works out and I would like to finally go get treatment, including therapy and antidepressants which will most likely be an SSRI (mom + brother both use them). 

I know that everyone's experience is different but I am interested to hear about people's experiences with their antidepressants. Being a young woman in my 20s, I am wondering how much this will impact my life. Have you found that taking drugs has negatively impacted your life and freedoms? I'm mostly wondering in terms of [casual] alcohol and drug* use, sex life, drowsiness, tiredness, sleep quality, headaches/migraines, appetite, and general physical health but I'd like to hear other experiences as well if you'd like to share them.

Everyone in my classes hate me and for some reason I just feel guilty all the time. I was raped recently and I'm on a waiting list for Councilling but I wouldn't know what to do. I don't like talking to anyone. I'm just messed up. I feel so guilty all the time. I've went to school drunk and high before but they don't notice. I try to tell them but I can't. I've got all the signs. It just seems no-body really cares or they think nothing's wrong.;Elouiserose

No one cares. Especially when you’re disabled and you kind of need help, then no one really fucking cares. When you call your dad to ask if he’ll donate towards your wheelchair, he tells you how stupid that is and how no one will want to give money to a stranger over the internet, and how he certainly isn’t gonna help. When you ask your boyfriend if he’s willing to share about the fundraiser on his fb page and he asks you to write the post for him and put it on his page so that he doesn’t have to deal with it. Even though you were really hoping that your boyfriend, future husband and love of your life would actually take the time out of his day to write something so loving and thoughtful about you to share with others so as to encourage them to give toward this wheelchair that you so desperately need. 
But, you know, he’s too tired and doesn’t wanna deal with it. It’s not like my mom said the same thing and had me write her post for her as well.

It is just becoming more and more obvious to me that as a disabled person who can no longer walk, I’ve become nothing but an absolute burden upon my friends and most especially my family.
They’re just too tired to care, I guess. 
Maybe they would be better off if I wasn’t around anymore. Then they wouldn’t have to take care of me, and they could get all the rest and relaxation they need. 
My ex’s would delight in knowing that I crumbled and failed and they’ll get their custody and their pride by knowing they were right about me all along.";mommyneedshercane

i miss being happy. i miss having hope. i think all of that has been squandered. i have no friends. i have no one that supports me. i feel so desperately alone with no way out. i’ve had a plan to kill myself for months but i’ve been too afraid to go through with it. i’ve been too concerned with the fact that there might be hope out there. lately after a few events that recently occurred, i’ve concluded that there is no hope. the only time i really “feel” anything is when i’m crying my eyes out and even then it feels more like self pity than anything.

I get to come back home in 11 days. Believe me I've been counting down for what seems like forever and even that last 11 days feels like an eternity in and of itself. I came from Los Angeles to Hawaii to pursue a degree in nursing but after moving here I've decided that's no longer what I want and I want to move back home. It's taken me a lot of work on myself and practicing self love to be okay to move onto a life that was not originally my goal. My boyfriend and I have been visiting each other back and forth and after each visit and felt more and more ostracized, inundated and hopeless about being in school and away from him. I feel like my heart stays with him and when I'm here I'm just not myself. Codependent? Yes, possibly. My therapist said that I just really love my boyfriend, but I don't know if that's all it is. He's really my only family and I love him more than anything on this earth. I am eternally grateful for him but for the past 5 days I've fallen into one of the worst depressive episodes I've ever experienced. I can't motivate myself to do anything but go to the gym and watch reruns of old movies. I cried (loudly) when my friend tried to get me out of bed to go to the cafeteria. I just feel so numb and like these 11 days will never pass. I know they will but I don't know how to get myself unstuck. This moment feels everlasting. I need someone to tell me I'll get through it. Or some advice as to how to pass time during these last 11 days. Anything helps.

She’s been talking constantly about how she was feeling like this was the biggest mistake of her life, how sad she was, and how she couldn’t see me because she knew she’d lose strength and want to get back together.

Turns out she knew all along.  She’s known she was done for a long time, and had been saying those things to make herself feel better about hurting me.

And now... I have nothing left.  All the plans we had together, the life we had created... the future we wanted.  It’s all gone.

This has been an awful weekend.  I ended up checking myself into the ER Friday night because I started having the most intense suicidal thoughts I’ve ever had.  Not because of her, but that definitely didn’t help.

It was the first time I’ve ever had to do that.  I’ve had suicidal thoughts for the majority of my adult life, but this was the first time I couldn’t get the thoughts to stop.

7 hours later, I was so ashamed I wouldn’t let the counselor call anyone to come get me (accidentally left my phone as my sister’s house) so the hosptial got me a Lyft home.  I arrived home to an empty house.  No one even checked up on me... and suddenly I was back to the racing thoughts.

And now, here I am two days later, and it feels the same way.  My brain is going a million miles a minute after finding out how she’s really felt this whole time, and even though I have my phone, I have no one to contact.

After my grandma with demenshia has mentally destroyed me by both being ill and calling me shit after working to help her. Even though I don’t want anything from her she seems to think I do; well I do want one thing, her love. I have been seperated from most of my family due to my parents being horrible people. So you know I come expecting to at least be treated like family, instead I am treated like a mistake, which I am, but it is whatever. Than I have to deal with shit at school with a teacher holding me back because she is a bitch and nobody likes her. For once I stood up for myself and told the school that they had to do something, and they did nothing. So I had to get away. I left for Arizona for independent study. I thought it was real, but it wasn’t because my cousin got jealous and came down and started to treat me like shit. She is crippled so you know I am supposed to feel guilty, but really I am not, because all she did was watch as my parents ruined my life. So why should I care if some drunk driver ruined hers?Than it ended I had come back to home independent study had ended and the thing I came back to was instant drama. Now I am just supposed to endure it, and deal with more crap in my life, but I have never had a good life. Why can’t I have a fucking break? I have been through hell, and the pressure to make sure my autistic brother is okay in life is challenging. I don’t know why people think a 16 year old can handle this. I just want to die and I can’t handle it. So I have lashed out. I have been drinking and I am about to smoke again, even though I worked so hard to stop. I guess I am just a bad person and there is no fixing that. I can’t leave. I am stuck. All there is to do is lash out. I can’t leave again. I can’t drop one thing. I want to kill myself. So I came for the advice of random internet people. They can hear me cry about how horrible my life is and tell me that I could have it worse or it isn’t that bad. This isn’t even half of it though. There is all this stuff about my long lost brother who doesn’t want to see me, and how I can’t be that son to my dad. How I will never be able to fill that hole in the family. So yeah...

so i was diagnosed like a couple months ago with mild depression and anxiety, something i already suspected.
thing is, before getting medication and i guess positively reacting to it? i used to get relatively good grades since my anxiety made me panic and cry and do absolutely everything and anything possible to not get a bad grade, so ive actually never failed a class. at the cost of my mental peace maybe but i guess it did the trick lol

however i got on meds and certainly i feel like most of that anxiety and bad thoughts are on check now, which actually feels kinda nice ig, but my grades just came in and i've failed two classes. contrary to how it would've been before, though, i felt absolutely nothing, which is certainly... weird on me, to say the least. so now i'm just worried its making me numb and will continue making me go downhill on my grades. 
my therapist, to whom i talked this morning before seeing my grades, told me in general, that i have to put my own effort too, so i guess it could be that? maybe i just got used to function only on anxiety and now i have to actually put effort out of will which i don't think i actually have? aaah, i actually don't know. i sometimes feel like my old way of living, just dealing with all that ugly stuff was somewhat better lol. maybe not really since it was exhausting and i absolutely wanted to die real bad, but at least i got academically good results you know

I live my life with such a high now (thank you cymbalta)that the littlest of lows can cause a crashing of emotions and feelings that feed the detrimental thoughts.
What if I had just been successful. What could I have done differently. What if it had been too late when I got to the hospital.
I wouldn't be here dealing with this shit.
These moments make me consider stopping my meds. Make me think of the false highs they're giving me. Make me consider that it's just a fake happy and my life really is shit.
I won't act on the feelings again. I know the repercussions. For my family if I'm successful and for myself if I'm not.
What a joke it all seems that in my lowest, hopeless moments I'm not living for myself. I'm not living for the possibility of a better tomorrow.
I'm living for everyone else who knows me. Who simply just knows of me. Living so I don't hurt others. It's so fucking sad.

My ex boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue about a month ago. He has battled depression his whole life. He’s gone through losing family members and for about 10 years he’s struggled with stomach and body pains. We were together for 2.5 years and it was the first time I was genuinely happy. Yes we had our arguments, but for the most part we were happy. Out of the blue he breaks up with me. He told me he didn’t love me anymore. I was crushed. We still live together and I’m trying to give him space. 

Last Friday we went out for a mutual friend’s birthday. I was the DD and he got drunk. He’s always the most honest with me when drinking. When we got home he told me that he has berretts and he’s in the 1% of people that develop cancer. He said he isn’t going to live past 5 years and “I’m in the prime of my life” and he doesn’t want to hold me back. He said he’s never been happy in his life but the last 2.5 years he’s been so happy. He just can’t deal with the physical pain he’s in everyday and having to deal with letting me down. His heart can’t take it on top of the stomach and throat issues he’s having. I begged him not to push me away. We have such a strong connection and I knew he never stopped loving me. 

The very next day he was sober and told me that we were never getting back together and that I had to move on. He said in 6 months when our lease is up his plan is to move out and nevrr talk to me again 

I don’t know what to do. Do I just suffer through this heart break and move on? He wants to sit in his room everyday alone and just suffer through the pain by himself and hates when I ask how’s he’s feeling. He’s texts me almost daily and we play tennis a couple times a week and eat dinner a lot together. I’m trying to be there for him because I know he suffers from depression and is precancerous, but should I just back off and give him the space he wants?";J-F89

I am not motivated at all to do things other than some school extracurriculars (high school senior). Like homework, hanging with friends, even just watching TV. It's like I am bored with doing nothing but lack the motivation to do anything else. 

I overeat. A lot. I'm 300 lbs and just under 6'5"" (male), but almost all of it is flubber. I'm not athletic (never done sports or anything). I'm overweight and I dislike my body. Eating as become something I do when I'm bored. It's also where most of my money goes to, ""treating myself"" to fast food to brighten my day.

I feel... Numb to everything. Went through two girlfriends in the past 8 months (one for 6 and one for not even a month) and didn't feel a thing with either of them. No butterflies, no warm tingle when kissing, nothing. I feel like I'm trudging through each day without a purpose.

I'm a bit of a wimp so I decided to write her a letter, she's the artistic type and really likes poetry so I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea regardless. I talked to her and asked her what she thought of the idea, she thought it was good. When she asked about the girl I would describe her buy fairly vaguely as to not arouse suspicion.


When I handed her the letter my heart was shattered. She flat out yelled in my face ""NO! NO ALIGHT! NO!"" then ran home with my letter. She texted me later saying it was the sweetest thing anyone has done for her and all that.

Poof. Sunlight gone.

My world has just been gray and bland for the past couple months since and only now have the emotions hit. I've been crying nonstop, back to when I was at my lowest in life. I just want to hug her and cry on her shoulder.

Like, dump me on my birthday out of the blue bad. Forced to still share an apartment for months. Responding to me saying I was still in love by proposing “NSA sex” and then proceeding to choke me during it non-consensually. Took a lot of therapy to realize how much being a people-pleaser caused me to sacrifice my own boundaries. 

I don’t want him back, not even a little bit, not even at all. I finally saw, after months of therapy, how emotionally abusive he was. But I got sorta curious the other day, pulled up his profile on a dating app (workaround from being blocked), and saw he was in an “open relationship.”

Now, he has BPD to the extreme. It could totally be a lie. In fact I somewhat suspect it is. I mostly hate that it affected me at all.

I think what’s going on is that I’m just feeling worse about myself. I know this is basically why they tell you never to check up on your ex. My morbid curiosity and/or attachment issues won out, this time. Comparing myself to him is making me feel terrible. He seems to be doing so great, and I’m so depressed I’m barely feeding myself and going to work. 

I’m about to move all the way across the country back home. I think it’ll be good for me, because I need the support of my friends and family. I’m not in a great position to really support my recovery here. And I’m in such a small town, I’ve been terrified of going out at all because I don’t want to see him. I have to drive by where he works (at the job I got him smh) every morning. 

I just feel terrible knowing that this lying, emotionally abusive, manipulative asshole somehow has it all and I’m stuck here alone. I hate that I’ve tried 3 more medication cocktails since we brokeup, and am still pretty damn depressed, while he seems to be doing great.

When I first moved out of my moms house a took him with me but after about 8 months my roommate bailed and I ended up living with my boyfriend at the time for about 6 months. During this time I couldn't have my cat with me and had to take him back to my mom's where he became incredibly antisocial, angry and anxious, he withdrew from the people and other pets he grew up with and it hurt a lot.

I've been lost for a long time. It's the main reason for my depression, I think. I seemingly have no interests, hobbies, goals, or aspirations. I have no plans or anything. I just wake up, watch TV, go to the gym, take the dog out, and eventually go to sleep. There is no substance to my life. I haven't had a job for a while, and I don't particularly want a job, or have any fields I would aspire to work in. I have no desire to have a relationship, and certainly don't want to start a family or get married. I don't drive, due to fear of driving. I don't know what I'm doing here, it's just a whole lot nothing. I live with my Parents, and we get along really well, but I would like to have something in life to be passionate about, to work toward. I've been looking for that something for many years, and I can't find anything. I don't know what to do.

734;I'm an international student and I'm getting really disappointed in myself...;2;bik85b;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bik85b/im_an_international_student_and_im_getting_really/;0;2019-04-29 08:53:30;"If you guys could just take a couple minutes to read and respond to my predicament I would really appreciate it...

As some of you know (and I figure some redditors aren't familiar with the U.S. education system) is that we have a 5.0 GPA scale that basically sums up your assignment scores at school. Everything goes in there, tests, quizzes, homework, etc. And I suffered bouts of depression a few years ago (like really bad, I had to be hospitalized), which made my GPA drop by 0.2 points.

In the U.S (at least to kids like me), a 0.1 difference could mean community college or top-tier university. My average is pretty damn low compared to other kids, but the things is, I didn't speak English very well, I had no friends, no teacher support, no understanding of this whole system whatsoever. I didn't know about AP classes and whatnot until my 10th grade, and at that point, it's obviously too late to raise my grades significantly.

So basically I ruined my future over half a year of suicide attempts and absolute nothingness.

Then there are the girls at my school who took 5 AP classes since their 7th grade, have a 4.5 GPA and still manage to maintain an active social life and even date someone. I asked everyone for their study secrets, turns out most of them just wing it. What the fuck? I say to myself. If I can't beat them at being naturally smart, I'll just have to work harder.

Except it didn't work for me. I feel like there is a huge gap between me and those kids who just seem to have everything figured out. I feel like the difference can't be made up with practice exams and study guides, and I'm just naturally dumb at this. In a system where tests take up 40% of my accumulative total, I don't have anything else to show for my ""intellect"".

Then the teachers always play favourites. It doesn't matter if I work hard because they never really bothered to breathe in my direction, they're too busy praising the smarter kids.

When I was not in the U.S, there were two kids in my elementary school: Sally and James. Sally is perfect, she is pretty, she has lots of friends, her grades never got below a 90 and all the teachers loved her. She was chosen as the exchange student to study in Canada for 3 months, she won the ""best academic performance"" and a shit ton of other awards every year, everyone wanted to be like Sally. James (now that I think about it, he probably had ADHD) on the other hand, was a typical problem child: he never sat still, he started fights and broke his own bones. His grades are a 60 at best, kids made fun of him and when he tries to curse at them tearily, they would laugh some more. He was often made to stand in the corner, make up for lost work when everyone else played during recess, and generally was just awful to be around.

I tried my whole life to gravitate towards being a Sally and stay away from a James. I feel like I'm losing balance.

Honestly, at this point I don't care if I don't get married, if I can't hold a job, if I can't make it past 30. I don't have any plans for my future. I would do anything to be at the top again. It was the only niche I knew how to fill in, and besides that I'm practically useless. Now I'm not even considered ""smart"" by my peers, I'm just average. Doomed to lick their shoes and eat their table scraps for the rest of my life.

(Sorry, that was really dramatic.)

Honestly, I *would* lick their shoes if it could get me into Yale. I know people tell me that it doesn't matter what college you go to, just be happy, be yourself and whatever. I can't be happy unless I'm better than everyone else. I never learned anything in my life about innate value as a human being, never knew unconditional love, never expected emotional connection from other people, but I guess I'm trying to believe I can find it on the Internet.

I know my philosophy is fucked up, but so is the place where I'm from. I don't think I dare to believe in that whole ""hard work will always pay off"" thing anymore, because only being useful or superior to other people seemed to pay off.

Please help me.

I got messages from him and someone else like ""where u at"", knowing that I couldn't go. No one messaged me otherwise. I spent all Saturday not speaking to a single fucking soul because no one gave a shit about me otherwise. I resisted self destructive behavior, then had a meltdown, then completely shut down. They posted a picture of my SO talking to people and being happy without me. I sobbed for hours. It felt like agony, like my stomach dropped and a knife was stabbed in my heart. I eventually cried myself to sleep by 5 in the morning. Then when he messaged me today, I couldn't help but give one word responses. I know I overreacted and it's not his fault. I encouraged him to go and have fun.

I still feel so fucking shitty though. I'm supposed to be visiting him next month and I truthfully don't want to go because I just want to be vindictive and petty and make him feel hurt. Which is fucked up and makes me feel worse for having those thoughts. I'm such a giant piece of shit. I'm sick of crying. My eyes are swollen. This isn't how normal people react. I hate this.

Edit: I'm still stewing on this because I keep going back and looking at the picture. Something that makes me feel so shitty is that the last time he visited, I brought him to a friend's party. He sat in the corner on his phone the whole party. But you know, with these friends he can actually talk to them.

I come across as relatively normal, I guess. I get a lot of people telling me I am intelligent. So what? It hasn’t made me happy up to this point.
  
I am just about the laziest person ever. This probably has its genesis in my upbringing; I was raised by two parents in separate homes in upper-middle class suburbia. My dad was always strict when it came to school and good grades, but not extreme at all. Besides school, he really was pretty lax. I didn’t have chores at my dad’s house, besides generally keep my room clean and do my dishes after I ate. My mom’s house was even more relaxed; I had no responsibilities in that home, and “if I tried my best” in class / life / etc., she was happy.
  
I always was intelligent and when I was young I believed that, or cared maybe. School came easy to me. I didn’t have to try, but pretty much always did my homework and such. That is, until middle school. One year I had Mrs. Maloney for algebra, who was this 80-something oblivious old lady. She would walk around the classroom at the beginning of each class to check everyone’s homework from the previous day, and I began showing her the same half sheet of paper with a couple graphs drawn on it for each homework check. She didn’t notice, and this laziness of not doing homework seeped into all my classes eventually.
  
From then on, I would maybe do homework to the best of my ability in the 5-10 minutes before each class, copy someone else’s, or just not turn it in for pretty much most of the time until I finished high school. I always did well on tests if I at least read through the material once, and therefore got mostly A’s and B’s with a couple C’s as well.
  
This was good enough to get into a pretty good university. Once I got there, I had no idea what I wanted to study or what I was passionate about. I took a bunch of random classes to try to get a taste, and ended up sorta liking one of my biological anthropology classes. I picked that as my major, based on that experience and also just wanting to get the selection process out of the way. I did not end up enjoying the major, like at all.
  
Throughout my time at UCSB, it was pretty much the status quo for me when it came to effort, except college provided even more leeway on pesky things like homework. I pretty much went through undergraduate not doing anything or studying for the first 9 weeks of the trimesters, and studying a little bit in that last week before the final. I again got mostly A’s and B’s, with a few C’s sprinkled in.
  
After UCSB, I still had no idea what I wanted to do, because I had spent all my time at undergraduate not exploring that. So my dad told me that I had to pick something, and law school or business school were the best options. I pretty much chose to apply to law school to appease him, but also because I thought that maybe I could be a lawyer for a few years to build capital and then do other things.
  
I studied for two months for the LSAT, the admissions exam for law school, and did really well. I applied to a bunch of schools and got into most of them with scholarship offers from many. When it came time to pick which school I would attend, I chose Cardozo Law in New York because they offered me a great scholarship, and I had always liked the idea of living in New York and being in such a diverse and bustling city.
  
For the first year in law school, I really tried hard. I forced myself to read for classes (something I hadn’t done since middle school), I studied really hard, and did pretty well. When it came time to find a summer job, I didn’t apply to many places (thanks laziness and procrastination!) and ended up having to rely on my dad to use his contacts to find me a suitable job. I ended up flying home to California for the summer to work for my dad’s colleague in a seemingly interesting area of law, entertainment law.
  
It didn’t take long working there for me to realize that I absolutely hate the work that a lawyer does. The process always goes something like this; client comes in with a certain complaint, look for the current law on that subject, then apply your facts against the law and try to twist them into a tale that looks favorable. That last part is always annoying and fucking difficult because the facts are just unique enough to where you aren’t sure the law applies to your facts at all, or they just plain work against your argument. Then its up to the judge or jury to decide if your version of the story is more believable than the other’s. 
  
I hate this process for a few reasons. Firstly, it is extremely isolating; you can’t exactly interact with other people while doing this type of work, and for that reason, nobody really interacts in legal offices. Secondly, it’s annoying perverting the details of a scenario to your argument as best you can. Most of all though, this annoys me because I don’t want to work within the law to effect change. I view the entire political system (and as a result, the legal system) as unworkable, and do not want to work within it to try to effect change.
  
This second year of law school has been the most challenging year of my life thus far. When I got back to school for the fall, I was already beginning to feel a little depression coming on. At that time, I also really began wanting a girlfriend, a subject I’ll dive more into in a bit. There was one girl who was my best friend at the time, and who I could tell had feelings for me back. She wouldn’t date me, however, because I’m not Jewish. Still, I had a personal connection with her that I had never had with a girl, and I spent almost the entire first semester hanging out with her anyway, hoping she would realize she was in love with me too and would change her mind. She did not. As the semester went on, I began paying less and less attention to school. By the midway point, I wasn’t really reading anything at all, but I still did okay in the classes. I took a break from my friendship with that girl, and that helped my mind-state a little bit.
  
Even though I was feeling a little better going into the spring semester, I did the same thing that I always do throughout it. Laziness and procrastination have led to me not doing any work or reading for school whatsoever during this current semester. I have finals coming up in a couple weeks, and who the fuck knows how that will turn out.
  
This intense laziness and habit of procrastination which I have outlined has been developing over the course of my life and is one of the main sources of my deep unhappiness.
  
Another source of unhappiness is my intense feelings of loneliness.
  
I was never really that good at making friends growing up. I attribute this partly to having siblings who were much older than me, so I spent a lot of time interacting with them, and didn’t know how to interact with kids my age.
  
I guess I had some friendships in my early years, but nothing noteworthy. My first good friend came in 6th grade, when I met Brad. He and I were besties in high school, and while he remained pretty much my only friend that I really hung out with a lot, over the course of high school he got more popular while I didn’t. 
  
I wasn’t exactly upset at this, I guess. I do remember feeling sad like I assume many kids in high school who aren’t popular do, because I wasn’t dating at all, didn’t get my first kiss until junior year, didn’t have sex till after high school, etc. I guess I probably thought it was because I was ugly or something, thoughts that don’t afflict me now. But looking back on it, I was not really that distraught over the whole thing because in my heart I knew I wasn’t ready for a relationship anyway.
  
I have pretty much one other friend from my high school days, and that’s it. It didn’t get much better when I went to undergrad. My first year, I thought things were going pretty well with the group of friends that I had made until I found out they had photoshopped a picture of the guy who shot up our school onto my face. So, onto year 2.
  
Second year of undergrad I moved in with my only remaining friend from the first year. By the end of the year we weren’t as close but we were still friends, but that didn’t last after I studied abroad. I thought not much had changed, but when I went to visit him—driving an hour to hang out—after returning home from Australia, he ended up going to hang out with someone else, so I just left. Haven’t really spoken with him since then, and I don’t know what happened.
  
Anyway, onto year 3. I moved in with a bunch of randoms; ended up sorta being friends with two, really just one kid named Kieran. Once I moved out though, not much contact. And that’s about it! I have no lasting friendships from undergrad whatsoever.
  
My romantic encounters were just as fruitless. I kissed two girls at UCSB the whole time I was there, and nothing more. At one of the schools with the most debaucherous hook-up cultures in the country. Sick!!!
  
I did have sex a couple more times in college, and they went a little something like this; random girl at Brad’s school that I can’t remember her name, Brad’s girlfriend’s best friend (who I vibed with but she ended up getting into a relationship and not telling me), Mary [long-distance relationship with an absolute psycho], and two prostitutes (in the Red Light district and in Australia). Literally not one moment of true connection with another girl, and besides these interactions, I never felt like anyone was interested in me at all. But even then, I don’t think it bothered me that much because I really wasn’t ready for a relationship.
  
Well, that’s all changed. I crave that connection with another person like fucking mad. I crave sex. I want to have someone to turn to when things are dark, and I want to be there for someone in the same position. I want a buddy to always go on adventures with and do risky shit and have fun with. I want someone to sleep by my side, and just to be able to feel them next to me (physically and their energy).
  
Since moving to New York, I have actually been lucky that the tides have turned, and I have made some great (platonic) friends. But they are busy with law school, work, etc. They cant hang out all the time. They have other friends. I don’t want to have sex with them. There are things about a relationship that are appealing to me above and beyond what I can get out of those friendships. 
  
The problem is, I don’t think I can get a girlfriend. I have almost never experienced what its like to have a girl be interested in you. Last year there was my friend who couldn’t open up because of her religion, but I felt it. I felt that connection. So I now know (somewhat what its like), and that probably makes things worse.
  
After that girl, I met another one who I’m currently going through mental gymnastics with to keep going. Sometimes she seems very interested in me. Sometimes its ice-cold. She slept over one night and we didn’t have sex, but it was the best feeling of my life. I felt so tuned into her, and so happy just to have her by my side. When things are off, I think it’s mostly because of her being in medical school. But it’s really hard now to deal with these ups and downs, and I still have my doubts that she likes me at all, because in my experience girls don’t like me.
  
Maybe (and probably) this issue stems from ongoing confidence, laziness, and motivation issues on my part. But there have been times where these haven’t been as prevalent for me, and it’s the same. I genuinely don’t know if I will ever find someone to create that bond with and to fall in love with.
  
At this point, I have come to realize that my life is a dichotomy; I enjoy my time when I am around other people, and absolutely dread any time spent alone. Because of this dread, this loneliness, I try to make the time pass as mindlessly as I can. I smoke a bunch of weed, watch a bunch of T.V., play a bunch of video games, and jerk off a bunch. And that’s pretty much what I have been doing lately with my life.
  
I’ve had clothes and trash piling up in my room at various times and for long-ass periods during this year (although right now my room is clean…er than that). I have just enough money to cover this upcoming month’s rent, and that’s just about it. I have put off getting a job because I don’t feel qualified or capable of any job. Now is pretty much the critical period where I must do this or I will lose my place after a month. 
  
I realize what I am supposed to do at this point. I’m supposed to make small goals, build better habits, get myself out there in the world, force myself to try at life. But I don’t want to try. I hate life and I hate myself. Every time I think of how I could improve my situation, I think about how much easier it would be to jump off a bridge. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the effect my suicide would have on my family—other than that, there is no desire on my part to stay alive. Life feels like a punishment.

I was well supported,both my parents worked,and everything seemed like a normal family. School was fine for me and I had plenty of friends and did pretty well there. I was a very happy kid,like I mean the type that couldn't understand how in this world people could kill themselves. My teen years were great too. Sleeping over at my girlfriend's house,going to concerts/expos,and working out. I had anything a mid lower class kid could need and knew better than to take it for granted,for I was never a hypocrite. Flash forward to 18 and the shitstorm hits the fan. Mom starts having physical problems,dad and mom quit loving each other,and I am moving to an alternative school. Now don't get me wrong,this school was cool and let you leave for lunch. I liked the teachers and the classes were different than the standard schools. Also I was able to graduate a half semester early which was awesome because I couldn't wait to play video games all winter and then enjoy the summer. Again things were still looking pretty good and I was still a happy young adult. Somewhere between the time I graduated and turned 22 things went horribly wrong. I developed severe depression and an anxiety disorder that murdered my social life,dad killed himself,and I was involved in a near fatal car accident. This is quite the shift from the cheerful boy I mentioned earlier,isn't it? I keep asking myself what went wrong in the tone of the Blink 182 song.

My ex-bestfriend used me for sex and emotionally manipulates me. We're not currently talking, but I miss him because he was the only one who (seemingly) loved me. My mom's new husband, who has been living with us for a year and a half is verbally (and today, for the first time, physically) abusive to me, and my mom allows it because she needs his money. I tell these things to the rest of my family in hopes that they would help, but nobody really takes the situation seriously. My friends don't really care about me -- they don't make efforts to see or talk to me. The only person I really confide in now is my cousin, who loves me, but doesn't really like me. Our personalities are just too different, but we pretend to get along because it's convenient.

I have been dealing with depression for a while, and I used to hate myself and blame myself for everything. Months ago, at my lowest, my therapist suggested self-affirmations to help my low self-esteem, and I think it's worked. I know now that I am a good person and deserve so much more. The thing is... I've become VERY resentful. I've come to believe that everyone around me are just assholes and that karma will get 'em someday. I am moving out and working and going to school -- so that helps.

I can't help but think of myself as a blameless victim of my circumstances though. I really do believe that I'm just caught inside of a black hole of drama that I'm slowly escaping from. I don't like thinking of myself as a victim, but it's the only thing that helps me keep going. I'd rather believe everyone else is just wrong and evil than think that this is just how my life will be, and that I'll never find someone who loves me and treats me the way I deserve.

I struggle greatly with self-hatred and I just don’t know how to stop. I’m in therapy and I’m on medication but for whatever reason I just have such a difficult time believing in myself again. 

My childhood was a mess in certain ways ie mother is a bipolar pill addict who is now crippled due to a stroke. She chose to quit physical therapy (even though she was progressing and walking with a walker) and now her right side has atrophied. My dad basically works in a nursing home now taking care of her (she wears diapers and soils herself instead of letting her caretaker take her to the bathroom) but like with her addiction he says nothing and let’s her do whatever. So he comes home at the end of the day and cleans her up and waits on her hand and foot. She’s obese now. 

In college, I was raped and then drugged and almost raped again. 

I’ve been working through these issues and I’ve gotten far to some degree. But my biggest struggle is not fucking hating myself. My depression reminds me of my mom and I feel like I’m turning into her, which is one of my biggest fears. Especially with my poor eating and lacking exercise habits. 

I want to be a filmmaker. I’ve been writing screenplays since high school and I used to write them all the time. But ever since I graduated college in 2016, I have no motivation. I made a short film, more or less about my rape, and it wasn’t as good as I wanted to be. And it’s my fault. I was in a horrible headspace, unprepared, and inexperienced. 

It’s been really hard for me to come back from that because it got rejected by so many festivals. I’ve only worked hard on one screenplay since then and I’m still not done. (Made that film in 2017 by the way) 

I’ve wasted so much time and even knowing that I continue to waste it. I’m not strong headed anymore. I don’t believe I’m capable of success. I look at other aspiring artists around me and compare myself so much that it makes it worse. 

I completely fucking hate myself and it’s ruining my life. I don’t know how to convince myself I’m not a waste of space.";PatrickDittoSwayze

This post is going to give a little background on myself.

I'm an 18yr old male how has major depression and social anxiety. My first experiences with depression and social anxiety started around the age of 10. I wasn't aware of what depression was at the time but I definitely had symptoms. There are reasons why I was depressed at that age but I don't want to share them. During the time I was depressed it wasn't too bad as I still hung out with my best friend everyday providing a distraction. My depression was worst at school and night, an overall sadness + some other symptoms for the majority of 5th grade. Summer came and school was out, things got better :) and I was a very happy kid. 6th grade comes and in the beginning I'm still pretty happy but then around 1/3rd into the school year I had to move. I move away from everyone I knew and that's what triggered my depression and social anxiety. 

After I moved the rest of 6th grade was a horrible year, I hated where I was and myself. I hated school, not that I ever enjoyed it but now I HATED it. Everyday was bad and when I got home I would just go to my room and research all day on why I felt the way I do. I looked up my symptoms and realized I had depression, so I would research all day everyday for months and months on depression and how I could get better. I also found out I had social anxiety by looking up my symptoms and so I would research that as well. I can't say much about this time period or how I felt because I believe I've blocked those memories, it was truly a bad time. To be honest I can't remember much of 7th or 8th grade either, it's all a big blur and I have blocked most of the memories. Before 7th grade I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was put on some medicine right away. Did it help? Sure I guess, it didn't take my problems away though but I was doing a lot better in some way. I had friends and I hung out with my new best friend all the time so it wasn't the worst. Skipping 7th grade into 8th now, it was by far the worst yet. I was doing bad in every possible way. I did absolutely no school work, my final GPA started with a 0.5. I tried to run away although now when I think of it I'm not sure if I was really trying. I walked out of school one day and was going to just walk away from the place I stay. I don't really had a plan other than to leave, no destination and I didn't pack. My original plan was to pack what I need and leave in the middle of the night. I think it took the school 30min-1hour to notice I wasn't there. The police didnt find me, my mom did. She was really upset as expected but she drove me back to school. I had to talk to police who I had already seen before after skipping school cause I hated school. These police are nice but all I can remember is when he said something about ""what if you got killed?"" I said ""I don't care"". And I didnt, I wanted to die. Just gonna end 8th grade right there because that basically how that year was for me. 

Highschool now, things were better and this is possibly the best I had been doing in a long time. Highschool actually was 100xs better than middle, even just being in a different building lifted so much negative feelings off of me. It didn't last long though, when the second quarter started this is probably around the time I started to deteriorate. I became anorexic over 2nd quarter, not know how skinny I was, limiting myself to at one point 6-800 calories a day and over exercising at the same time. I never thought I was skinny I never even saw a change, I thought I was still a little fat no matter what. I was maybe around 5'7"", 15yrs old and the lowest weight I got too was 113lbs. I was underweight and looked like a stick figure but not in my eyes. At the same time my depression had gotten the worst it's ever been. I don't remember everything but after winter break I had to go back to school and I tried a couple times but had panic attacks from social anxiety. I gave up and then everything got so much worse. I became even more suicidal and after trying to go to school once I started self harming because I wasn't normal. It was punishment and an escape, over the next couple of weeks it only got worse. I made plans to kill myself and my right thigh was covered in cuts. I was dating at the time and she knew I was going to kill myself, I don't know if I told her explicitly but she knew. She said I had to tell my mom or she would tell her. And if she didn't say that I wouldn't be here right now. It was 2am in the night I just made a bunch more cuts on my thigh and I was hours away from suicide in the morning. My plan was when my mom left I'd write a note telling her what I had done and to not try and look at me just call 911. And that I was sorry to everyone. I was going to hang myself with a belt in my closet that morning. I knew I would do it, that night I tested to see if it would work. I hung the belt and put my head in the loop slowly letting my body weight down to let the belt tighten around my neck. It would have worked. But now I had a choice I tell my mom or my at the time girlfriend would. I decided I would tell her myself, so I texted my mom at 2am something like I'm suicidal and need to go to the hospital. I got ready to go and went downstairs, my mom didn't wake up from the text so I had to wake her up and tell her to check her phone. I don't know what I was feeling but I felt like some weight had been lifted. I went to the hospital stayed for a little over 24hrs and got out. My mom took my razors, hid knifes and looked other razors away while I was gone. I really don't remember much about this time other than that I know months after I was out I was still suicidal often thinking I had missed my chance and should've just killed myself. I finished school in a separate building which was basically online school, staring at a computer all day doing my work. Summer came I think it's around this time me and my gf broke up because things weren't the same. I didn't take it that bad and was okay with breaking up. 

Now after summer it was 10th grade and I went back to regular school with all the other people and my friends. It's all I wanted to do, seem normal. I made it through the first day and things were looking up in a way, I was doing better. And although I still had depression and social anxiety with some suicidal thoughts I made it through that year. Onto 11th grade still was depressed and socially anxious I had made little progress from the previous year. But this year less suicidal thought, far less. 
But since freshman year I had slowly started isolating myself. And by now (11th grade) I went home from school everyday and went straight to my room. Messaged some friends but very rarely did I ever hang out or even go outside other than to let my dog out. And now it's 12th grade my final year of highschool. Over the summer I didn't even hang out with my best friend 1 time. So all I've been doing is laying in bed all day everyday in the dark, no sun light in my room and I never went out side. Besides going to school I did absolutely nothing. There was a period where I fell again into bad depression thought about suicide seriously and started to self harm again. Self harm lasted around a month but wanted to commit suicide stuck around a little longer. I pushed through. Got better and even made efforts to get better, started weight lifting and eating as much as I could. It only lasted 3 months but I did improve myself quite a bit. 

Currently I stopped working out about 2-3 months ago, stopped eating as much as I could. Some days I don't even eat. My appetite is lacking and my depression slowly is coming back. I'm dealing with it though, and I'm not suicidal right now. I have less than 2 weeks left of highschool and I'll be graduating. I'm now 5'9"" 18yrs old and around 150-153 lbs from last time I checked (I did get up to over 160 but now I'm struggling to keep the muscle and weight). I'm doing okay.. although very isolated and my okay is still real bad compared to some one who doesn't suffer from these things. But I'm okay. 

My plans: now this brings me to why I made this account. I have like 3 reddit accounts but wanted to start fresh. I've been subbed to depression and social anxiety subreddits on my other accounts for a while now. They both have a lot of negative post, about the suffering. I want to change that, I want to shine some light on the subs in hopes that I could even reach one person and inspire them to try and change. How will I inspire someone? By changing myself. After the background I hope you can get an idea of how I am doing right now, not good or in my words okay. I want to be the success story not only for myself but for people looking for the inspiration. I want to be happy, I don't want to live a life that is made up of not even wanting to live. I don't want to struggle. I don't want to be depressed or social anxious. I'm so tired of it and I'm ready to change. 

Im going to be documenting myself (writing posts about what I'm doing and how it's effecting me) trying to get better. I already know things I'm going to be trying out and doing. I have it planned. And I know when I'm going to start this journey. 

My posts won't be scheduled or frequent as it takes a long time to change yourself. 

Thanks for reading if anyone actually sees this :) I'll probably edit mistakes and add things later. Yeah I just wanted some background so people can know where I'm coming from and maybe relate. This way when I post about how I'm doing how things have changed they can know where I started and see okay this thing did help him maybe I should try it and see if it helps me. I just want to get better and also help others.

One of the biggest issues I've been having lately is an intense attachment to the internet--not to anything on particularly on it, just to the endless scroll. Which I'm pretty sure is directly correlated to spells of anxiety and depression, as a sort of vicious circle--perhaps both as an escape from it (I can distract myself from the worst of the rumination by just scrolling) and contributing to it (the more arguments and articles I try to keep track of on Twitter, the more distracted, and so the more anxious and bored and empty-feeling I get). So I've been trying to kill that--and it had been working. Two days with basically no mindless scrolling. I thought things were looking up. But--then--a tiny, honestly probably forgettable mistake--and I'm back to running back over it in my head, beating myself up for messing up, beating myself up for feeling so bad about something I probably don't even need to feel bad about, back to wasting a whole day mindlessly scrolling through shit online in an attempt to stop thinking about how bad I feel, which then only makes me feel worse. 

I just don't know what to do. There are these brief little windows where I feel good, but as soon as so much as one metaphoric drop of rain falls on my good mood, as soon as one little difficulty appears, I spiral out of control, and fall right back into a hole where I'm either alienating my friends by repeatedly making them reassure me that I did nothing wrong, or completely withdrawing from the world in order to keep from doing anything that might be construed as wrong. 

I consciously *know* what will make me feel better, even when I'm in the middle of a spiral. Put down your phone. Go for a run. Stop worrying about things you can't fix. Eat better/eat *something*. Take a nap. Listen to the people telling you that what you did wasn't wrong, that you're imploding over something that literally doesn't matter. But knowing doesn't help, can't actually get you off the couch when you're just *stuck* there, half-replaying the event that bothered you over and over and over, and half-reading click bait titles in hopes of distracting yourself (but really only frustrating yourself, because you could be spending time on something actually worthwhile, if only half of your attention and ability to care wasn't being sucked away by the feelings of failure and inadequacy eating away at you and sapping your energy).

God. This is just a rant. I just don't even know what to do. Yesterday was so good. This morning was so good. But now I lost all the time and effort I had put into getting back to that point, and am back at square one.

I’ve never been in any form of a relationship that hurts my confidence and makes me like shit I doubt if I even have the social skills to maintain one

I've cried violently every day for almost 18 months now. Maybe missing a day here and there. It's my only relief from the intense emotions and panic that I have about my future. I dont necessarily think too far into the future or try to predict it, but I have no plan at the moment. I'm completely disinterested in everything, even though I don't just sit around all day and do nothing. I force myself to go to college, get good grades, exercise, eat a balanced diet, interact socially, help out friends in need, I even write down my thoughts to get them out of my head. But I feel directionless and empty and alone. You cant tell from the outside but I'm constantly wracked with negative emotion. Most of it comes from the fact that I have to find out what career path to choose soon, and I know of nothing that I would be good at, and nothing that is interesting so I cant even just plow down the wrong path with competence and make some money the hard way. My grades are good, but I feel they will all be for nothing since I cant decide what to do. Btw for any mbti people an insight to my personality is that I'm an INFP

I also have a strong desire to be in a relationship and never have been. I'm decently attractive and exude false confidence that everyone thinks is real. I attract girls that I find pretty, but it's hard to be interested in them, and I dont want to hurt them if my emotions build up and I become too distant. So I always stop texting them or tell them I'm too busy... I know I probably dont need a relationship right now and it wont solve my issues, but it would be nice to have somebody cheering me on or supporting me when things get really bad. Typically men are seen as the ones who need to be emotionally strong and confident, which I just don't ever see myself being. I'm too realistic with myself and I know I'm not a genius or an extremely skilled person, and I can barely work at a competent level so if girls see the truth about me they would be repulsed. I also have bad small penis anxiety which I guess I could get over, but I'm below average and I'm worried that rejection would tear me apart.

 I havent felt a close connection to someone since my mom died. She was the one person who I felt understood me. We would have long conversations about whatever we felt like talking about and those moments are when I felt most alive. I was already depressed before her passing though, and I think it has to do with taking too many psychedelics. It's hard to make meaning in my life when I've already experienced the greatest high and the strongest fear/pain possible. I feel robbed of all new experiences and life doesnt seem to offer much now. I cant live at home forever and I'm scared that I will end up homeless or completely dependent on whichever family member I can talk into letting me live with them. I'll just be some pathetic 20 some year old loser with a minimum wage job who cant afford his own place. 

So I'm trying all the recommended things to deal with my depression except I dont have a goal to work towards. I know if I had one I'd feel so much better, but like I've said, nothing really seems interesting and most jobs I'm not cut out for. It makes me feel so stuck, that my condition prevents me from attaining it's cure. I also dont understand why after over a year of pushing myself and opening up, and scheduling my life, and still making down time to rest, I dont get better. It's like my brain wont heal and I'm taking on all this extra work for nothing. Making no real progress even though I'm putting in the work.";PhrygianNoodles

As life has no meaning, then the will has no drive. I do nothing. That's as close as I relate to a common theme I see here. Inaction. 

The issue however is, I don't hate life, I don't hate happy people, I don't hate myself, I'm just not happy and see no purpose in actions in life besides satisfaction of the basal needs, in short living like a beast, yet it doesn't feel sufficient. I am meeting all my needs but there is something that has yet to be satiated, like a psychic thirst. It is not satisfying. So what's missing? How can I figure out what action to do to fulfil this weird unspecified thirst? 

Of course, one might be inclined to say, well silly, you need a passion! Well of course, I have thought of it. So far, among a multitude of attempted hobbies, studies and relationships, I have been unable to find passion. An active search for passion is too tiring so I have since given up on an active search for a passion and transitioned to acceptance of life: life is mostly boring but it beats being dead. Cool shit happens once in a while so I'll stick around. 

Nature, in its grand wisdom, granted a beast among others the gift of Reason. If reason is what separates us from the beasts and I have lived as what I described, a beast, then clearly that which has yet to be satisfied must be that which the beasts lack. 

In the same way that thirst is satisfied by drinking,

Why are we so afraid? I know it’s time. It’s time to talk about the elephant in the room: Suicide. Depression. Anxiety. Mental health! 

Why do people seem so depressed nowadays? I’m sure I could look up some research and statistics but this isn’t that kind of writing. It’s more of a “talking out my random thoughts so I can try to make sense of the world” kind of writing. 

I personally believe it has to do with the development of society and technology. We are all too addicted to our phones. We are all too addicted to Facebook, instagram, snapchat... or my personal favorite; Reddit. We get lost in the internet and don’t focus on what’s in front of us. 

It sounds so cliche but I know it is true. I am guilty too. Most of us are. 

For those of you who aren’t obsessed with your phone/computer... Are you happy? 

Where does happiness even come from? I have been thinking about this a lot. Would endless amounts of money make everyone happy? Well, yes and no. Money can certainly fix a lot of problems and make life easier... but would that make you happy? 

Maybe it would. Good for you! Because for me.. I think I would still feel lost and empty. I would still be searching. Searching for what? I’m not too sure. 

Something new, something fun, something that makes me feel alive! 

Something that also gives me purpose. 

I have recently started picking up trash around my community and I love it. I don’t like picking up muddy cardboard boxes, used condoms, or broken beer bottles. But what I do love is seeing the (minuscule) difference I am making in the world. 

Sadly, it’s not enough to make me feel happy. 

Is how we feel already predetermined by our brains wiring and genetics? 

I should probably do some actual research after attempting to write this nonsense, however... 

I’m tired of feeling sad and empty. 

I am tired of feeling like a burden because I feel this way. People don’t like sad people. People are uncomfortable around sad people. 

I am uncomfortable being sad around people because I’m afraid they will be uncomfortable! 

Most of my life has been filled with this sadness, an empty feeling in my gut that won’t go away. 

Recently I have had some glimpses of hope. I started taking anxiety medication again and have been working on being a more thoughtful and caring human being. (I believe your happiness correlates with how good you are in this world, if you are deviant— you will feel pain.) 

I have an amazing, supportive and loving boyfriend who I would like to marry one day. I am so lucky. I have a beautiful cat who purrs on my chest and licks my nose. I am so lucky. I work with special needs adults and they swarm me with hugs and “I love you”s. I am so lucky. 

 But if I am so lucky, why do I still feel so sad today? 

I feel insecure and lost. I am unsure of my next steps in life. I have narcissistic parents who have largely contributed to me hating myself. Obviously this is where my sadness is coming from, right? 

I’m quite certain it’ll never fully go away— the sadness in my gut. That empty feeling. 

Sure.. it may disappear for a few weeks, maybe even a few months... but it will always return; one way or another. 

What I do know is that I need to be stronger than it. We all need to be stronger than it. Maybe life really is just pointless and nothing we do matters BUT maybe it all does matter? Maybe what we do here determines what is next. We don’t know and will never know what happens beyond our lives here on Earth. But here is what is important: 

Don’t give up. You’re a lot stronger than you think you are.";jalyssap

For all the other medications, I literally felt no change even after being on each one for over six months

&#x200B;

List of meds I've been on that didn't work: 

Celexa, Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Mirtazapine, Wellbutrin, Abilify, Restoril, Seroquil, Saphris, Buspirone, Intuniv, Xanax, Vistaril, Ativan, CBD oil, and Ambien

&#x200B;

List of medications/drugs my body actually reacted to:

Lexapro: all it did was wall me in to this claustrophobic dystopian existance of ""meh"" emotions, meaning I only ever had one emotion and it was ""meh"" which is a horrible way to live trust me.

Latuda: Helped my psychotic symptoms but I've already built up a tolerance to it so it is starting to not work again (and I'm on the highest dose)

Medical Marijuana (THC): Helps me with sleep, anxiety, and depression but at the cost of increasing psychotic symptoms. It's also not legal in my state and wont be for years.

Dextromethorphan Hbr: (On third/fourth plat doses) Helps with sleep, anxiety, and depression, for me has no effect on psychotic symptoms, but this is not something you can take like a medication, you have to wait between doses or it can really mess you up.

&#x200B;

I'm meeting with my Psychiatrist tomorrow, and I'm just gonna have him take me off my meds because it's just a waste of money. My plan is to move to a state with medical marijuana because from my experiences that's my best option and it won't destroy my brain like DXM would.

&#x200B;

Oddly enough, I still find it strange that all the medications I tried (almost all of which I swear to God are placebos) are legal but Marijuana, LSD, and Psylocybin Mushrooms are illegal (and all 3 that I just listed are safer than the other medications I took and wayyyyy safer than opioids). It just feels to me like the pharmaceutical companies work with the government behind closed doors and they don't really care that they're ruining people's lives and just want money. 

&#x200B;

One last thing, I can't talk to therapists because 1. It doesn't help me and 2. I can't trust telling them about my substance use. I know self-medication is frowned upon, but I've been severely depressed for over half my entire life and I've gotten significantly better results by handling it myself, especially since I know myself better than anyone else does.

&#x200B;

Tldr: I've been put on just about every med there is and no legal drugs help. Gonna get my Psychiatrist to take me off all my meds (waste of money and time). It's BS that weed is illegal and opioids and alcohol are legal.

My ex friends (several of them) bully me. I now get daily bullied for my hobbies, girls I like, and my looks. It wouldn’t hurt as much, if it wasn’t my ex friends who were the main perpetrators. I now only have 1 close friend, and about 3 more distant ones.

819;5 year anniversary coming up;1;bii8ee;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bii8ee/5_year_anniversary_coming_up/;10;2019-04-29 05:43:40;"Approximately May 1st will be the 5 year anniversary of my break up with my first/last/only girlfriend back in college. 

She was a great girl, cool, street-smart and seriously pretty. Like way out of my league. But back then I was a charming & fun guy with a promising future and a high degree of confidence so I understand how I could’ve landed a girl like her.

Fast forward to now and I’m virtually a loser with low-functioning depression, ZERO confidence, unemployed, lots of student debt and living with my parents (sexy, I know). I’ve gained some weight then lost it then gained a little back—just can’t get rid of lower back fat/love-handles. I started antidepressants in like August but they’re not working as much as I hoped they would. 

Probably important to note: she cheated on me with a few guys. I wasn’t strong enough to break up with her myself so we stayed together for like another year and a half until she broke up with me. I do sincerely think my depression stems from this. It’s like she verified all the negative things that I have long thought about my body/self. I don’t personally blame her for cheating because she’s just a human doing something that humans do (I’ve even told her this). Nonetheless, I do think she played a role in this even if she didn’t purposely try to destroy me. Although, after she cheated on me it was still possible for me to be happy with her during times when I was living in the moment and forgot she cheated.

When she broke up with me I tried my absolute best to still be friends. I think we still are but I rarely hear from her. She has most definitely moved on from me because she has had like 4 or 5 boyfriends after me. I guess this is a good thing because I don’t want her to be sad like I am and I kind of take comfort with the thought of someone being there to take care of her if it can’t be me.

Since that breakup, my life has been very sad, meaningless and lonely. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be with a girl who makes me feel as good as she did, mostly because I no longer have the energy or confidence to pursue women of her caliber. I’ve found it very difficult to not think of her on a daily basis over the course of these last 5 years because so many things remind me of her and the thoughts are involuntary so it’s not like I can avoid them or anything. 

My options are slowly approaching zero. Dare I say: I’m getting closer and closer to only having ‘the option to end all options’ if you catch my drift. 
I’m not sure if I will ever get better. Medications, therapy, exercise, diet, mediation, nature walks etc aren’t helping.

Resistance is futile.";finnae

 I got my first job in January, but so what? It's a shitty job, with shitty pay, shitty hours, and the people there treat me as if I'm some sort of malfunctioning tool, which I suppose I am just a tool, I'm as easily replacable after all. You graduate high school, being told that you'll be able to find something good afterwards, but nope. Not in my area anyway.

I flunked out of college out of incompetence and loss of motivation, I wasn't good enough for the air force after quitting my first attempt at college, I have no career path, and definitely no real future to look forward to. Best prospect I have is a bullet to the head, and then people would be happier to have me out of the way. 

Even outside of work and school I have nothing. I never felt good enough to be in sports, there's no other activities around me to join,no clubs or special interest groups of the sort. All I've done my whole life is play video games by myself, since no one wants anything to do with me. They became the only thing I was able to enjoy, and now I feel like I'm mot able to do that. And there's no replacement for that void that would be left behind if I stopped. I tried learning some competitive games for the sake of trying to find community for once, but even that doesn't seem to work. I invest a lot of time into them, but never improve, and no one wants to play agaisnt or help a pathetic scrub like me. 

I played a lot of Dark Souls to try and validate myself through its challenge, but even all of that doesn't seem worth it anymore. About the only the thing I was considered mildly good at by other people us writing, but in my eyes I know just how wrong that is. Even by this post you can probably tell how poor my grammar and punctuation is. Comma splices, improperly placed paragraphs, all the other nonsense. I can go on and on about how much of a failure I am.

So we went to get gas first. I already knew what was going on. He wanted to use my money for gas, return the cans and get heroine. I spent my money on his gas, he bought drugs off his dealer.
I got tired assert this point. I thought of my friends and family and how much of a burden I am. How much of a prick I am. 
I thought about suicide then. About how nice it would be to cut myself. I never wanted to cut myself that badly. I thought of it and was excited about it. If I was able to be alone yesterday night, I would of did it. But my dad sleeps in the same room as me.
I tried to sleep, I wanted to cry but couldn't. I would have to explain why I was crying. So I thought of my friends and family. How they have to hate me. How my grandma yelled at me for not being grateful for what I have, saying I'm a disappointment. My friend/acquaintances. How my friend V has to think of me as a burden. Same with the other two. They only talk to me because they have too.
I'm just a failure, I don't want to get out of bed ever. I only do if I'm told or to go to school. I don't clean my room or myself anymore. I don't care about eating, I only do if its home cooked. I drink maybe half a bottle of water and a soda a day.
I want to talk to someone but don't want to be even more of a burden. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve what I have, the food I throw away, the house I can live in, the education I get. I don't even feel like I deserve to be happy anymore.
I really want to cut myself when I get home. I want to talk. I want to just disappear. 
Im a failure. I don't deserve the things I have. I feel horrible. I can't talk to my friends for their sake and my family doesn't think depression is bad, but just an excuse. So whats the point of telling anyone. 
I feel so numb. When I'm not, I want to die. I'm just done with hating myself. I don't want to be a burden. I'm getting closer to wanting to do something more dramatic. I might cut myself tonight. Why not.

Certain things I see or something thing about give me a brain zap. It's only certain things.

I walked in Walmart and they had an aisle there that had all the same product on it that an old retail store i used to work at. I got a light headed zap. I turn around then look back, zap again. When I was leaving I looked, another zap.

There's a local store with this old dude as the logo next to my gym. Every time I see that dude I get zapped. Why? Kinda scared to go to the gym lol.

I just wanted to write this down because I have reached a point in my life where I think i can't handle it anymore. It started when I was a child. I was always a very shy and scared person. After 4th grade I went to a new school and I didn't know anyone there. I was sitting all alone at first and I became very very VERY shy for some reason. Talking to people was hard, talking to girls pretty much impossible. I always felt like the odd one out. I had trust issues and felt like i was constantly bothering people just by being around. So I became kind of a loner at the time. Also my grades were very bad and I felt like a total loser. I started hating myself. In 9th grade I had my first girlfriend. For the next two and a half years she would be with me. I  had absolutely no self esteem and I was probably the most jealous boyfriend you could think of. Then I failed 9th grade, had to do it again, new class, new people, horrible for me. I managed to make friends but again I always felt like the unwanted one. I just did not fit in at all. I started staying up really late just looking out the window, thinking about life, about how i thought i was never good enough for my gf. I felt like everyone hated me, felt like a total failure. I started having suicidal thoughts. In 10th grade my grades were fucked again, and Ive had enough of my relationship. I broke up with her because my 16 year old self just didnt want a relationship anymore. Sounds like a dickmove and yeah it probably was. It ended peacefully tho and I still do some smalltalk with her every now and then.I barely finished 10th grade and switched schools again because the current one was too hard for me. Keep in mind the german school system is weird haha. Long story short, the next two years passed by and I completely failed school. It was all for nothing. I was the only one who failed. Ive never felt so stupid, so ashamed and so alone in my life. I found a great job tho and I am now an apprentice in a big company. Thats the job I wanted to do anyway so at least that turned out fine. But still I was so done with everything. Failing school was my first complete breakdown. After i switched schools suddenly people from my old school started spreading the rumor that I hit and physically hurt my ex girlfriend which wasn't true of course. I told her about it and she was shocked aswell. People who didn't even know me started talking shit for no reason at all. This led to me isolating myself even more. I started drinking the pain away. You might think that things got better after I got the job i wanted, but no. I love this company, I love this job but I hate myself. I hate everything about me. I always feel like Im just not good enough. Ive accepted the fact that I will never be a confident happy person because I'm constantly feeling nothing but emptyness, sadness, shame and loneliness. I constantly think about death. I can't deal with other people anymore. I just feel worthless and I'm scared of bothering people. I'm a loner. There's just nothing I can do. I just want to die. I can't deal with this shit anymore. I don't have any plans for the future. I pretty much gave up on everything. Suicide and alcohol are the only things on my mind. I spend the weekends driving around in my car, visiting random ass stores so I can tell myself I actually did something on the weekend. Then I'd stay up all night and drink. Until its monday again. Ive been doing this for the past one and a half years. Im just so fucking tired. I see all these people having a good life, going out, being successful, travelling, having great relationships. And then I see me drinking the pain away on the weekends, sitting at home, doing nothing. I see me not having accomplished anything in my life. Every morning i get up and ask myself if its all even worth it. I often get only 3 or 4 hours of sleep because I can't find any sleep. Nothing is fun anymore. I feel like a damn zombie. I always ask myself ""Wtf went so wrong? Why am I here? What happened?"" Fuck everything honestly. Writing this stuff down was pretty hard for me so please excuse this mess of a text. I dont even know if any of this makes any sense. Its just so hard to describe how i feel. Maybe I'm just a whiny asshole. I don't know. I'm just  so tired. I just want all this pain, emptyness, loneliness, self hatred, fears and bad thoughts to end. I want to end it all. I'm just done.";AdiDrokz

I have met new people, had very much fun, and enjoyed my life...but I've also had shitty things happen which have led me to the point of posting on the depression subreddit.

To begin with, I've had a shit roommate in Uni. He regularly purposely wakes me up before 7 am, he passive aggressively complains about issues without telling me what the problem is, he consistently insulted my friends because they didn't like his passive aggressive behavior, and he hardly ever leaves the room. This, since August, has tortured me.

Later, my bestfriend at Uni that I had acquired over first term was obligated to drop out and it left me distraught. I still dont know why it happened, but I stand by her as she continues her life. Since she's left, my friend group has changed dramatically.

At the beginning of this term, I found another potential best friend here at Uni and began building that relationship...but one of my bullshit friends in my friend group has continually made jokes about us being gay lovers because we partake in more activities together than with the friend group as a whole.

This has occured regardless of me asking my other friend to cease his incessantly irritating behavior.

Yesterday, everything broke off. We got into a fight and the other friend continually made jokes about us fighting like lovers and it catalysed my need for distance.


Today, I have spent the lot of the day crying and attempting to complete a major assignment...but I've also contemplated killing myself via 6 different methods and I don't know what to do with myself anymore...


I hate this uni and I hate the way I feel, but I know that I've worked too long to off myself now...I'm fairly certain that I would never go through with it, but I cannot help but think about it...

840;I need to just type.;1;bihp8b;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bihp8b/i_need_to_just_type/;6;2019-04-29 04:49:10;"I don't know how to begin with this, i'm going to just write and hope it comes out into something coherent.

&#x200B;

Next year i am going to turn thirty.  I have battled depression and anxiety since i was 12 or 13.  I had a difficult childhood and development, getting severe OCD around that age which caused me to miss a lot of growing up and learning social interactions with my peers, making friends. Multiple therapists have noted this is probably the cause for my issues below.   Thankfully, age and good medication and therapy has made the OCD dwindle down to nothing more than obtrusive thoughts, and i'm aware at how rare it is to be rid of such a debilitating illness,  but i don't feel lucky.

&#x200B;

I have a feeling those missed years have harmed me.  Here i am, A guy at nearly 30.  I am physically fit, perhaps averagly intelligent and i don't feel like i'm unattractive - Yet i have been without having had a Job, any friends or support networks to speak for and without reason or routine to my life, and had to move back in with my parents, leaving me without personal space.  I have a child, who's five. And if it weren't for this i probably would have acted on my thoughts of harm a long time ago. I would say he's my only friend in the world. He draws me pictures, calls me his hero and i have to fight back any urge to bawl or cry like a baby from hearing his misplaced pride in me until he's asleep, because in due time he will realize what a loser i am.  I feel underserving of any friends, love or relationships because i am not at the socially accepted 'point' in my life where i am supposed to be.

&#x200B;

There have been times when i've gone out of my 'comfort'.  I have done volunteering, attended meetings, done therapy.. and yet i always seem to fall back into the slump.  I feel as though i'm not cut out for life, and am strangely at peace with this if it weren't for the fact i have a little child who relys on me.  I am torn between the unconditional love a parent has for their child and the deep, foreboding feeling of doing something that's irreversable, because i can't find where i belong or a purpose to my being.

&#x200B;

I guess i wanted to just type out my thoughts, today has been especially difficult.  I dream of making one last break, one last all for nothing try at somehow fixing something, because i am 100% certain that i won't be here for much longer.  I don't understand why it seems so difficult to make friends, or have a job, or your own space.. these things people just 'do' feels like some kind of unsurmountble mountain to me.   Either way, any kind of comment; just a nod from someone who has read through this would be appreciated, like i said i haven't done this before.. i'm not sure what to expect.";Whatsthepoint90

I recently saw my young, male, depressed self on the search for a chatgroup for depressed teens. I found one, although it was ran by the Samaritans. The same people who hung up on me crying because they couldn’t understand me (good job, fuckheads). Since this is my first post, I’ll introduce myself. You can call me by my long reddit name or by whatever. I don’t care. I’ve got diagnosed depression an incurable mental ""illness"" which is used waaaaay too often as an excuse. Speaking of mental illnesses, why are they even called that? Who says “Hey, this person feels like dogshit! Let’s throw an incurable illness at them!”. I like to think of it as a sort of uniqueness. I used to be a happy kid but, since I was 11, things just went to crap. My parents started hitting me, my mum (yes, I’m British.) started yelling at me more and more for shit I didn’t do. I always looked happy on the outside. When I actually had friends and didn’t sit in the corner of the class listening to indie rock, they were the only people who knew my emotions. But then they turned on me and, you know, gave the year 10 shits another reason to beat me up. It all sounds so small, right? But think of it like this. You can have a massive bucket that holds gallons of water. Now drop a small bit of water in every now and then. That water takes up hardly any space, but eventually it will get to the top and overflow. That was when I was 11/12. Although I know I shouldn't (And you definitely shouldn't either), but I’ve been contemplating turning to marijuana to help me. I find it helps to sneak out at night have just walk through the forest, except when my parents scream at me at 3am on a Saturday for it. Not sure why, but I always used to love pop music until recently. When I started feeling more depressed and suicidal, I moved towards more indie/alternative rock. I'm not sure whether it was linked, I just thought it was interesting. Could it be because the lyrics are usually more honest? I guess a song like No Care by Daughter has more meaning than a fucking Justin Bieber song about sex and shit. Anyway, I’m ranting again. It happens when I need to vent.

I spent the past 8 hours concentrating and working hard to finish it and it feels so rewarding. But I still feel guilty. I’ve been letting my depression get in the way of my education, so it feels strange to then celebrate the fact that I managed to suck it up at the last minute and not be a lazy brat who can’t be bothered to do her coursework at all because she’s sad.

Should I be happy that I didn’t let myself ruin my coursework and grades? Or should I be disappointed for allowing myself to leave it for so long and have the quality be lessened since I did it all in one exhausting and anxiety filled day? 

My emotions are conflicted. I want to be happy for myself but I can’t tell if it’s my depression telling me I shouldn’t be or whether it really would be a stupid thing to be proud of. I mean, a normal person would be ashamed to leave something important to the very last moment, right?

TLDR; can’t decide whether to be happy that I finished my coursework or sad that I left it till the last moment.

It’s almost like being in a wrestling match where u are the underdog, except you know for a fact that you will lose. You can decide to forfeit the match and not fight at all, in which case you lose, or you can decide to fight and lose but at least you fought and made some friends along the way. It’s hard to distinguish though, between losing because you were just the worse player, or losing because you unknowingly sabotage yourself because subconsciously you’re not really sure that you wanna win.

Ever since day 1 I've been nothing but an embarrassing disappointment, both in school academically and socially. I remember when I first started 7th grade, while I still had my depressive episodes here and there, I still tried my hardest to portray myself as a positive, polite and overall nice guy, 

&#x200B;

I feel like all of that positivity got burned away past 9th grade. I'm now depressed almost every day, I fantasize about going into the woods with a shotgun and blowing my head off and almost every time someone in school gets a bit too close to me the first thing I think is that this person is gonna make fun of me because of something or other.

&#x200B;

Not to even mention my shitty grades which honestly, I have lost all the energy and motivation to correct.

I’m a junior in college and my depression has become extremely debilitating recently due to trauma and other life struggles. School has become such a challenge for me. I don’t sleep at night due to insomnia and nightmares, and I experience exhaustion, flashbacks, and panic attacks during the day. I have also relapsed in sh. School just isn’t a priority for me right now, and I want to focus on my mental health. My mom and therapist are really against me taking a medical leave. They think it would be worse for me, and I should just use my skills to get through it. The thing is, I typically really enjoy my classes, and I do my assignments to the best of my ability. Missing classes do to exhaustion/ flashbacks/ panic has put me way behind, and I just don’t have motivation or energy to complete my assignments. They are making me feel extremely guilty for wanting to take a medical leave, and tell me it’s not what is best for me. I feel like they are against me as opposed to supporting me, although I do understand that this is what they think is best for me. I feel so conflicted. I want to do what’s best but what I think is best for me isn’t the same as what they think is best for me. What are your thoughts? Have you ever taken a medical leave? Have you ever disagreed with your therapist? I’m just at a loss for what to do. I feel guilty for wanting to take a break and focus on myself.";lunatheunicorn1

idk if this fits the sub, i looked over and it doesn’t seem like it’s against the rules but if it is then i’m really sorry. i do have depression myself but i’m not entirely sure if it’s in the mix here but i think it is, somewhat. 

i have two online friends. we’re gonna call them caleb and amelia. 

on one hand, caleb has been suicidal for the past couple of months and i have been trying to console them. he’s been pushing me away i think and. he just blocked everyone on his private twitter account so he can “talk freely about wanting to kill himself” and whenever i try to talk to him he just fucking shrugs it off. and he mentioned doing embroidery and i asked what he was making and he got really mad and said “none of your fucking business” i. didn’t ask it rudely and i was still consoling him and i know it’s best to get his mind off things so i don’t know why he was so mad and i just want him to feel better but i feel like i’ve run out of options. i don’t know what to do. i keep trying to help but it’s not working and i just feel useless

other hand. amelia has been my friend for a real long time and her father just killed himself. i. don’t even know what to do here. of course i consoled her but i. can’t say anything i can’t relate i don’t know how to comfort or tell her everything’s gonna be okay because despite knowing they will be it’s still so fucking scary and she hasn’t texted me much and i’m not sure if it’s be alright to text her because i can’t imagine the fucking pain she’s in. 

third hand (that we all have) is just that. this is gonna sound petty as shit. but. i also feel like nobody cares about me. i don’t even have a fucking excuse i just. ive been trying to speak to people and have them care about me and have people like my art and nobody fucking does nobody likes me nobody fucking cares and i can’t do anything right and i’m gonna die unhappy and a failure and it frustrates me real bad that i feel like this because i’ve got to be there for my friends but there’s so much weight on me and i just wish i was a better fucking person who people cared about and not just a shoulder to lean on but that’s so fucking selfish i don’t know!!!! i’m so mad and upset and i don’t know i just wanna fucking disappear because every time i try to make anyone happy it either gets ignored and or hated on and i just. want to stop being a negative impact on the god damn world. mmmmmmmmmm";testawaythrowaccount

This has really started to upset my mom. She calls my grandmother names like stupid and crazy. I swear yesterday she called her retarded, but she claims she was calling the situation retarded. My mom believes that my grandmother is doing this on purpose just to get company, antagonize her, or get meds from the emergency room. Wherever I try to explain to her that this is a serious issue, she snaps at me. She gets real defensive about how it has nothing to do with me, and how it's between her and her mother. Today I asked her why she gets upset by it if it's all just my grandmother ""doing it on purpose"". I tried using her sister as a comparison. Asking her if she would get upset if she played the same ""games"" as my grandmother. She snapped at me again, and I just walked away. I'm done with it.

I’ve always been kind of numb and had erratic moments in front of people. I don’t know if feeling like there’s nothing to life than just living and existing and following each day is normal or me being hyper aware. I don’t have any goals at all and if I once said I want this or that I would later just accept death is easier. 

I’m scared I’ll become numb enough to cut myself and so forth. Not like I haven’t harmed myself because I am a numb person. You could say I have trich. Hair pulling disease as a result of being numb or needing to feel something. Right now in life I see nothing to live for.

I’ve suffered with severe depression and anxiety for about 6 years. I’ve successfully been offered 7 jobs in that time, only 3 that I actually worked at. I worked at jcpenneys in 2015 for about 3 months before I had a mental break and quit. Then I worked at target in 2017 for about 3 months, same thing happened I just increasingly got more and more anxious and depressed that I stopped going in. Then I worked at Michaels for almost 4 months before the same thing happened. I’ve tried 2 different meds, no results. I tried seeing a counselor in 2015 and then online therapy last year. Neither were helpful at all. 

I’ve been applying to work at literally dozens of place over the past few months. I had interviews at a handful of places over that time, but never offers. The last one I did on Friday I just heard back today that they are moving on with other candidates and I just broke down. I can’t imagine going back to work in retail, the last “job” I had I was hired at Old Navy and on my first day of training I literally ended up walking out because I was in such a state of distress. I don’t know why I am like this, I don’t know why I get so overwhelmed by everything. And it seems like even if I wanted to no one will hire me now because of my spotty work history. 

I just don’t know what to do with myself or how I’m supposed to live. I’m supposed to be moving into an apartment with my bf in a little over a month but we can’t afford it if I don’t get a job.

Time has proven over and over again that a lie is the most effective way to deal with the things you have no control over

Keep listening to the playlists and mixtapes they made for you, and over analyze every single word

“was this a sign that it was all going to go wrong?”

no, you were the one that tried too hard and cared too much, not them

Stay up every single night staring at your phone, attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons, these constant reminders of your loneliness into nothing more than a bad dream. Praying that just for one second you could feel the warmth of love so many others have, but never return back to you

Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself, never stop writing and drawing in it
Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip

Watch them smile as you get in your car

Always talk down on yourself whenever possible, your life is shit because you deserve it. You must have done something really bad to make them leave you like they did, it’s nearly impossible to cry now

Next up, avoid your actual friends for weeks on end even though they’re the only shred of light and consistency left in your life, if they wanted to see you they would come, but they won’t

Lay in bed for hours, stare at the birds out the window, wonder how loneliness has impacted the animals you constantly compare yourself to

Slump over your desk in school, and play the smile like a valiant warrior
but you’re no warrior, you’re a loser

Give something meaningful to someone you care about deeply, and watch them react 

Go to the gym, and by the gym I mean the parking lot of the gym, have a panic attack in the car and go back home

look at yourself in the mirror
wonder where the passion went

Try and find your brain through bottles love, you realize you’ve spent this whole time trying to be at peace with your heart when you should have been trying to communicate with it

Take time out of your day for that friend you care about deeply

watch in terror as they cry in your arms

Lastly, start to lose interest in the things you love, watch as you take a backseat to life

don’t try to fight it

slowly become a secondary character in your own motion picture

But most importantly, drown every horrible paralyzing feeling in alcohol

somewhere along the way of learning to conquer these pains you realize you weren’t looking for a way to conquer your loneliness 

you were looking for a way to talk to it.

Of course there will always be an issue of accessibility and availability of therapists (and affordable ones at that).  Just feel like even if we don’t have anything apparently wrong that we should still get checkups in order to vent about how we feel, make sure we’re in touch with our mental health... more of a preventative measure instead of seeking help after we’re already severely anxious or depressed etc.;tryingtofixmyacnelol

Initially, I believed the problem with myself is severe anxiety, not depression. I saw a therapist before seeing a psychiatrist, and ""talking it out"" doesn't work for me. I'm not an outgoing, talk about feelings type of guy.... I'm introverted and don't like to open up to people very often.... though I did open up to the therapist. The therapist came to the conclusion that my ""problems"" stem basically from ""laziness/anxiety"". So I asked him to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and he told me he is just a therapist and can't prescribe anything......

&#x200B;

Anyway, after dealing with the medi-CAL (california free insurance) people, and request a psychiatrist, I deal with the hassle/wasted time of them referring me to someone else! It ends up being a woman whos IN TRAINING to become a therapist! aka, complete waste of time for me. After explaining myself to her, she did help me actually get an appointment with an actual psychiatrist, which I appreciated.

&#x200B;

So, I go see this psychiatrist. Not that I have anything against immigrant doctors, but my psychiatrist is a Vietnamese man who had a very hard to understand accent. After talking with him on the first appointment, I tell him I have severe anxiety, which has persisted for about 2 years now. I explain the situations which caused it to arise, and yadda yadda. 

Throughout the entire time, I didn't say I was depressed. He just kept hinting at it over and over, until I finally said ""well yeah, sometimes I am sad, uncaring, don't leave my house/room, etc etc... So then he says, Ok well thats depression! So he prescribes me Lexapro... he says it is also for anxiety. I was thinking there was something out there that was JUST for anxiety, which is what I believe my main issue is, as in the past I've heard both good and bad things about anti-depressants, I personally did not want to take them. Welp, there I was with a prescription for Lexapro...

After taking it for about 5 days I began to notice side effects. I would get headaches, sweat, and have sexual side effects.

After about 3 weeks, I still had anxiety, even more in fact it seemed. And I felt more depressed, knowing im taking these pills which seem to do more harm than good so far. The Doc said it could take 2 months for full effects....

&#x200B;

Well, things never got better for me on Lexapro. I told him this and he prescribed me Clonazepam with it. Cloneazepam actually seemed to help... I would take it, and get a noticeable reduction in my anxiety, would feel calm. If I take it at night, it helps ease my mind so Im not worrying about things constantly, keeping me up all night...

&#x200B;

So, I asked the doctor if I can stop the Lexapro and just take the Clonazepam. He said no, the lexapro helps the klonopin, etc etc. Even discussed trying something besides Lexapro, but he told me no to continue the Lexapro. 

&#x200B;

This is a huuuuuuuuge wall of text, and I havent even gotten to my point yet so I'm going to skip straight to it.

Last time I picked up my Lexapro, (which has been going straight into the trash can), I noticed the prescription paper said (Your insurance saved you $542.93). WTF!. Are you actually serious. The klonopin it says (your insurance saved you 24$), yet the Lexapro is 20x more expensive!!!!!!!!??!??!

&#x200B;

Thats when I realized its a big fucking scam. Doctors are prescribing people these daily pills which do more harm than good to some of the patients, and its all for that $500+ insurance money.

&#x200B;

Yes, by now (its been 5 months) I am depressed. My dad died of cancer a few days after Christmas. I left my state where I lived on my own with roommates, to move back to my hometown to help take care of my dying father. His passing affected me deeply... I am now stuck living here, in this city which I HATE, no friends, and ALL i want to do is move back to the state I went to college at, and have been living for the previous 6 years. However, I have no money, just debt. I have too much anxiety to ""get a job"" (honestly I do, I get crippling anxiety when my SISTER or family come over and I'm not in my room with my door closed)

&#x200B;

I spend my days feeling tortured in this room, suffering from a dull-anxiety filled existence. However, these ""Pills"" are supposed to cure my ""depression"" which they havent. However, they cost $500+ each refill and guess what? That's about enough to legit ""cure"" my ""depression"". I cannot work at the moment, I am unable... I would honestly rather kill myself at this point my anxiety/unhappiness is that high. 

&#x200B;

What would help? Something that seems so simple...

To move back to the other city, to have an apartment for \~6 months, and funds to live off for that amount of time. 

THAT would cure my depression. THAT would allow me time to get my life on track to help me rid my anxiety.

(I would focus on doing what I feel I need to do to FIX myself... I KNOW what I NEED to do... its not taking some damn pill that just gives me side effects. I NEED to go to the gym, change my diet, BE AWAY from my immediate family and people who give me huge amounts of anxiety.... THAT is what would help me. THAT is what would fix my mental state. THAT would be ample time for me to fix my own problems, and then get back in society....

&#x200B;

I've had jobs. I've been a social person. the past 2 years have messed up my mental state, and I'm stuck in this ""WELL IF YOU WANT TO MOVE, YOU HAVE TO GET A JOB, SAVE UP THOUSANDS, RENT A TRUCK, AND THEN WORRY ABOUT GETTING AN APARTMENT"" - yeah, sorry, I have .01% motivation to do any of that, I'd honestly hope I die/kill myself before being able to do all that....

&#x200B;

Anyway, this is a long stupid rant.

&#x200B;

TL:DR

The price of my monthly useless medication is enough to improve my life/cure my mental issues much better than taking an overpriced pharma-pill which is currently going straight in my trash can. Different people have different reasons for their depression/anxiety, and sometimes a magic pill isnt the answer, yet currently in our society it seems to be the only option....";apparently-depressed

What I mean by that is, I was taken out of therapy cause I seemed to be better and it seemed there wasn’t anything wrong anymore. But even though I was told I was better (and being honest I did feel a whole lot better than when I started therapy) I haven’t felt like I did originally, pre-depression, if you will. It feels like there constantly something there nagging at the back of my head that I can’t make out, as if it’s constantly in my peripheral vision but every time I begin to make out what it is, it changes or darts away. I’ve made attempts to seek out what it might be; originally thought I might be autistic or have an antisocial personality disorder or some shit, I took tests when I was having therapy and apparently I wasn’t (well technically I’m nearly autistic, out by a hair) so it’s not that. Thought it might just be cause I’m lonely, then I made new friends when I started college, that didn’t change anything so it wasn’t that. I thought it might because of my body, that I wanted to be thinner, so I starved myself (yeah great move, Slice) and tbh it felt good for a while, but it still didn’t hone in on the feeling. I thought it might be my general attitude towards existence, I feel like nothing in the universe matters, not even the universe, I feel there could be nothing rather than something and there ultimately wouldn’t be any difference, that also doesn’t seem to be it, cause even when I have my bouts of optimistic acceptance, where I use this belief to motivate myself, I still feel that there’s something off. It’s as if there’s something there just filling up an entire section of my brain, not allowing me to fully engage, not allowing me to be fully happy. But I should be better, that’s what the counsellor told me, that’s what the doctor told me. I was able to put it off and get on with it and be “fine” for 2 years after therapy but now it’s actually getting to me. I need to know what it is, I can’t just be shit for no reason, right?

I wouldn’t call it depression at the time. I have been through many traumatic events. 2 years ago I moved countries and live by myself away from my family.

Once I first moved, I was very cheerful, making new friends, joking around constantly, keeping up with my work. Had a social life. I was happy. 

But about a year ago i broke up with the only girl I’ve ever loved. I think this is what made me spiral out of control. I had been sad the last weeks before we broke up, but after it happened I just didn’t know what to do with myself. I hate her because of what she did to me, genuine hate. Whenever I see her in class every day, hear her voice or simply think of her, I get physical chest pains and intense feeling of dread and depression. My life used to be 50% her and 50% school work.  This is the point where I spent about 3 weeks trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I think I’m depressed.

Things that used to make me happy and I enjoyed, I’m not interested in anymore. I can’t enjoy a show. I can’t do sports and skate. Nothing brings me joy. Just this weekend I had my school prom, which was amazing but I was never happy during it. I left early in the rain walking home. The same weekend I went to a rave of my favourite type with friends. The rave was great, but I didn’t enjoy anything. I can’t enjoy anything no matter how hard I try.

At the current moment, my friends have had 2 years to get to know me. Everything was great in the beginning but my depression slowly pushed everyone away. No one wants to hang out with a sad piece of shit. I no longer feel the need to talk to them, which led a lot of people to shut me out. Everyone knows me as the sad troublemaker. 

Now I have loads of work every day. I have other responsibilities such as finding a apartment and a job. I’m uninterested and unmotivated.

I’m uninterested in life. I’m never happy. I don’t want to wake up in the morning. I’d be ready to kill myself, if I didn’t know how much that would hurt my family. I have people who love me, but are unable to understand my situation in any way. I’d never commit suicide, maybe I’ll be happy soon, maybe I’ll be happy in years. Maybe. 

I’m completely alone. 

I tried all the usual shit, going out more, exercising, eating good, keeping myself busy.

I can’t sleep at night. I get random bursts of needing to cry. I’m anxious and stressed all the time. This is what pushed me to chemicals.

Chemicals and self destructive tendencies. I don’t want to hurt myself but maybe subconsciously I do. I repeat dangerous mistakes multiple times, things that can ruin my life. I ended up in the hospital once. Scared my parents to death which haunts me every day 

Weed helps, but only as long as you’re under the influence not in every day life . It makes me forget. I won’t do it anymore, it helps, but it’s too expensive and not worth it. 

The next thing was benzodiazepines. After some research I saw that it’s prescribed to people who have similar issues to me. (Insomnia, anxiety, depression). I abused them very rarely, only when I wanted to completely wipe my mind and pass out. Otherwise i took low doses every day for about a month. (10mg Valium).
It helped. It really did. It kept me motivated to work and to be social. It made things good again for the time I was using it,but benzodiazepines  are dangerous, addictive. I didn’t want to do it without a doctors prescription and a real schedule of how to use the medication. So I stopped.

As soon as I stopped everything went back to the way it was. If not even worse. I was back into the suicidal mindset. Everything got much much worse. 

The next thing was cigarettes. My dad has smoked his whole life and due to watching and smelling him do it while I was a child, I hated it. I would literally vomit every time I try a cigarette. But now I smoke. It’s awful and I don’t want to do it. 

The last thing is alcohol. Alcohol helps a lot. It gives me a couple of hours of not feeling completely worthless. It helps with insomnia. Helps me fall asleep by blocking out my thoughts. I haven’t been doing it often yet, but I can predict my usage will increase. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to fix myself. I’m tired of being depressed and broken. I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. I don’t know who to talk to, so I scheduled a shrink appointment which will be soon.

I need help. Someone please tell me what to do. 
I’m uninterested in life and nothing makes me happy. 

I just want to be normal. I want to smile. I want to care. I want to not let my parents down. I’m lost.

* Can't socialise with anyone without being really awkward. Everyone else in my class does it ten times better. I also get panic attacks in social situations.
* The list goes on.. I just can't count them.

Then it started to decline so very, very slowly. My Ex started to take away my routine bit by small bit. She stopped me from working out, seeing friends, or focussing on work. She was insanely, sickeningly jealous. I don't know how I let it happen to me, its not something you will notice while you're in love justifying things to yourself. 

I ended up chosing her over EVERYTHING. Once she felt comfortable about having control of me emotionally, she started to manipulate me, emotionally abuse me, and strip me of my own identity. She cheated, lied, and fucked her way to whatever she wanted to feel. She would hurt people just to get attention. In my life I have never met a human being so cold, calculating and absolutely reckless. She stopped at nothing. She attacked my parents, my sister, even her own family members verbally and shamelessely every day.

My old self died a slow death during that year. 

At the start of 2018 she left. Dumped me out of nowhere, but still kept abusing and controlling me for at least half a year. At this point, I was too weak to block her out of my life, to end contact. It was not until October 2018 I started looking for help. Because I needed it. I never wanted to kill myself or harm myself in any way, but I was sliding deeper and deeper into a hole I could not climb out of on my own. 

I lost my heart. My fire. My conscience. I did not know who that man was anymore whos looking at me when I look into the mirror. I moved out of my flat and back into my parent's house. I've been in Therapy for almost a year so far. 
I still can't engage in any romantic or intimita relatioship, because I can not trust any woman with my love anymore. It sounds silly, but I will have to learn how to do that again.

The moment I knew I needed help, was when I collapsed one evening. I had a panik attack like never before in my life. It left me naked and scared. The next day, I went to my doctor and told her I need help immediately. 
I was sent to a mental hospital in which I stayed for about a week, until I was stable enough to sleep at home again. 

After that I went to a day clinic for 8 weeks, in which I went through multiple group sessions with people who had similar issues. I did not feel alone anymore. At the start of my last three weeks, a woman my age started visiting our group. 
We immediately got along with each other. It was amazing, we felt a connection to each other from the first moment.

Don't worry, this won't be a love story. We're not in love, or have anything more intimate than the ocasional cuddle in bed. 

But we told each other everything. We talked for hours, opening up to the other one. 

In therapy I learned, my Ex is suffering from BPD.
It doesn't excuse what she did in any way. But it made it worse, and it explained to me why she acted the way she didn't. My questions finall, got answered. 

Now this girl from the clinic is also fighting BPD. You may wonder right now, what the fuck I am doing letting someone like this get close to me again. 

But I learned from my mistakes. We've talked about it. She knew she would eventually end up using me for sex, so she told me. She told me about her sexual freakouts, her drug abuse, the way how horribly she treated men. 
She told me about her abuse, the rapes she had to endure, and the hardship of being a foster child, whose mom abandoned her at a very young age. This woman is fucked up in her head in any way you could imagine. 

But she does not let her sickness control her behaviour anymore. Shes still struggling with her sex drive, but that doesn't worry me. 

She helped me realize, everyone fucks up in their lives, everyone can be a horrible person. 

But the difference is, she values me enough to protect her and me from herself. Its ironic, that the very reason I got sick in the end is the one that helps me heal. 

As weird as it sounds, letting go of the past and not judging people for their mistakes is something I forgot how to do. 

Now ofcourse that won't really help you get better, so lets fast forward to April 2019. 

I've been friends with someone from the US, I live in Germany. In January he decided to come over and hang out for a week, go sightseeing and the likes. 

We had an amazing week. 

The morning I dropped him off at the airport, I was struck by the realization of what my sickness and my anxiety took away from me. What I have been missing just to soak in misery and pain for two years. It changed my perspective in life, and I want you to try and do the same thing to your perspective on your life.

We are where we are right now because of whatever happened in the past. Thats something we all have in common. It happened and the consequences are here now, ours to bear. 

Most of you can probably relate to imagining how much better everything could be, about dreaming, wanting, longing for something we think is out of reach. Be it weightloss, a test, university or success in life. 

We need to stop waiting for motivation. Motivation is a moody fucking bitch, who always arrives way too late and never stays enough to help. We think about the past and the future, but we forget to think about today. About right NOW. 

Ofcourse your dream will seem totally out of reach to you right now. Theres so much work to be put in, its scary, demoralizing. 

Yesterday happened and we will not ever be able to change that. Tomorrow is uncertainty. Worrying about what could happen tomorrow, will stop you from being the great person you have the potential to be. 

Act now. You wanna lose weight? Go for a walk, 30 minutes, each morning. No excuses. If it rains, put a coat on. If its cold, wear a scarf. Half an hour everyday. You focus on that. Nothing more. You will never do 100% of what you need to do to get where you want to be in one day. Instead, focus your energy on doing .1% ever single day. 

If you keep doing it long enough, you will stop having to force yourself to do it. Then you will enjoy it. One day, you will excell at it. 

And never be ashamed of failing. Failing is human. Without failure you can not succeed. Whenever you fail, and you feel like crying and screaming, then fucking cry and scream until your lungs run dry. It does not matter. Its okay. 

Try again tomorrow, try again and again until you stop failing every day. You'll fail maybe every second day. And then every third. Fourth... so on.

Don't forget to reward yourself. Treat yourself. Take a nice hot shower, a bath. Start getting back into that hobby you stopped enjoying years ago. Learn something new. If you're on a diet, its perfectly fine to reward yourself with artery clogging junk food once a week.

Whatever is in your head as you may be reading this, what you always wanted to acheive, experience, or do. Do it now. There simply is no other time than now. 

Don't let your depression control you. You alone decide who you are and what you want to do. 

Lets do it together, guys. One tiny bit every single day. We will lose battles. Trust me. There will be days where you want to throw it all down and give up. But you won't. You won't, because we will win this war. We are strong enough. And if you think you're not, then set out to become strong enough. 

This is your life. Yours alone. 

Go out into this world and strive. Light that tiny flame in your heart, kindle it. Strengthen it and let it consume you until you burn bright with passion and strength again. 

Go, and act. Do what you want to do. A tiny amount each day. Work and take what you always felt like you deserve. 

Stop dreaming, waiting and making excuses. Start acting NOW. I will be with you out there, fighting my fight. I will think of every single one of you out there and I will know, together we can become stronger than we ever were before.";Karthagos97

First things first,i apologize for my spelling error in my username. I used to have a Reddit account a while ago,but i ended up forgetting my password after a long time of inactivity so i had to make a new one. The spelling error doesnt matter though,as this isnt really a throwaway account. I wont be using this account anymore on my twentieth birthday on June 21 2019. 

I have decided to end my life on that date. There was a time,many years ago where things weren't so messed up. Where i actually had good days. Good days meaning i would wake up without feeling heart piercing sadness. Without feeling the mental scars of all of the things i have been put through or the ones i put myself through. The memories of people i have lost. I actually had a sense of self. I had things i enjoyed. 

But for the past few years,its slowly gotten worse. Way worse. I lost a job oppurtunity that i had been looking forward to due to my mental health history in February. I felt so ashamed,especially after i had to tell what is left of my family that it wasn't going to happen after all. I quickly fell back into using drugs,after being sober for a year. Since early February,ive been smoking a lot of meth daily. 

It helped at first. It was my first time trying it. I used to use many different drugs,and was addicted to prescription medications (adderall,klonopin,percocet) and dissociative drugs (ketamine). Meth at first worked great. All of my feelings of pain were gone. I lost so much weight,i'd go multiple days without eating. I felt energy,and the emptiness was gone. As of the past two weeks,i've been feeling shitty. 

The high doesnt help anymore. I just feel slight mental numbness,with tons of energy. When i comedown or wake up without it,my depression is amplified to a point i've never was possible. I've slowed down my use,and its not as bad now. Now its just back to being depressed as usual,while being tweaked. 



I've sat and thought about things. I know i'll never be okay. I know that i'm fucked up. I know i'll never forget the shit i've seen and been through. I know that life isn't right for me. I've always wanted to start a family. You know, wife,kids,some pets and all that. But i know i shouldn't. The idea of my child feeling/thinking the way i do makes me sick to my stomach. And the last girl i dated (last year) told me that no girl would ever want me. That she wasn't in love with me anymore. She used all of my insecurities against me,and ran off with someone i thought i was friends with. 


This is beginning to turn into a long rant,and for that i apologize. I don't know if anyone will see this. But the purpose of this account is just for me to get my feelings/thoughts/whatever written out,so i can put things in perspective. If my future posts are relatively professional,then i'll link this all to my Facebook rather than a suicide note when the day comes. I will also be using this account to talk with anyone that would want to ( i do not want to be talked out of it,or get told false promises of how things will change or get better). 

Thanks for reading. I apologize for the long text. I wanted to keep introductions short. Have a good day,all.";Throwawsy274746474
919;My depressed boyfriend broke up with me. Is there any chance of reconnecting?;6;bifnsj;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bifnsj/my_depressed_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_is_there/;2;2019-04-28 17:29:35;"My boyfriend \[21\] and I \[20\] have been together for about a year in an LDR (about 2 hours away) before he broke up with me on Friday. He has been struggling with depression quite severely for the past 1.5 months because in September he moved to a new college, couldn't attend class due to anxiety and struggled to make new college friends because of said anxiety. When he had an episode in January, I told him that I would not leave his side, even if he or his depression pushed me away; and back then he cried, hugged me and thanked me for that. Despite our individual struggles, we were very loving and were always there for one another. We spoke about the future \[as all young couples do\] is somebody I truly love and care about deeply.

It did get worse, however. Fortunately, he started to take some new meds and is in the early stages of seeing a psychiatrist now. But fast forward to now, on Friday he said that his whole life felt out of control and that he was so lost. Therefore, he said he couldn't be in a relationship right now because he didn't feel like he could give me what he thinks he ought to be giving me. We exchanged ""I love you"" and through the tears we said goodbye.

To be honest, it's been only about 48 hours since this all happened and I am doing more okay than I thought (but perhaps I'm in denial). Anyway, he called me today and proceeded to update me on his weekend. He told me he was proud of himself for seeing his friends, and I said ""well done"" and meant it because I know from previous experience how hard it is to bring yourself to show up for those closest to you (e.g., friends). Then, we proceeded to talk about how he is feeling, and I was saying many things to which he said ""yeah! And nobody else understands this about me,"" and ""I can only really talk to you about these things,"" which did confuse me a lot.

Out of selfishness, I brought up the relationship and he began to cry. I reminded him how, in January, I told him that I wouldn't give up on him even if he pushed me away and that I still hold myself to that because I believe you don't give up on those that you love. I acknowledged that this is just a breakup for me, but this is his whole sense of self that is up in the air at the moment. He agreed and this stung, but it's the truth anyway.

We still proceeded to talk and I tried to direct the conversation onto slightly less negative things and said: ""My dad is returning from his trip. I'll be coming home in May and I'm so excited to see my family."" And he excitedly said: ""Oh my Boo \[our nickname\] is coming home!"" I felt awkward at this point and I said ""maybe we can hang out?"" and he said, ""I'd really like that."" Before we hung up, I said to him that I wasn't giving up on him \[selfish I know\], and more importantly, I told him that I didn't want to treat him like he was fragile, because I said that I knew he was strong and I wouldn't treat him like anything less than. He cried and said ""Thank you, you have no idea how much I appreciate that. Everyone treats me like I'm broken and it makes me feel worse."" But then, alas, he was quite upset and told me he had to go. We said ""goodbye, love you,"" and hung up.

**So here are my questions:**

It is all too fresh and I am confused. Is it possible that he does not love me anymore and that this could be an easier way of ending things \[cynical\]? Or that he possibly still wants me in his life but doesn't know how to, considering everything else in his life is uncertain?

Furthermore, should I continue to keep in contact with him? Logically, I would say no because this will keep me in a prolonged state of denial. But as the only person he can talk to, I don't know how I could look at myself if I took the only person he could talk freely to and without self-consciousness. Next, I don't know whether to abandon hope on ""us."" As the breakup is so fresh, the only thing I want is to see him, hug him and have him back in my life. Selfishly, I am still too in love with him to just be his friend. If I put my all into him with a vested interested in getting back together, I would just end up resenting him if it didn't work out (again).

Sorry for how long this is.

\[**TL;DR**\- My depressed boyfriend broke up with me because he ""can't"" be in a relationship at the moment. But then called me two days after and said ""love you,"" and wanted to meet when I was next home. Confused, heartbroken, and unsure whether to stick by him despite him saying he ""can't right now,"" or to just move on by myself, no contact.\]

920;I've been suffering from sever depression all my life and you're the first one to know about it.;3;bifmpv;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bifmpv/ive_been_suffering_from_sever_depression_all_my/;0;2019-04-28 17:26:53;"This is probably going to be a very long post because I haven't really, like, ever talked to anyone about my problems. Not my friends. Not my family. Ever.

Guess I'll start from the beginning of my life. My mother was married off at a very young age to my father. She was unfortunate enough to have to provide dowry to the groom's family. That's not all. She was belittled and verbally abused as her mother-in-law didn't find the two beds, three couches, a huge wooden cabinet, a dining table and TV to be good enough. She used to verbally abuse my mother and in some cases, physical abuse was observed. My father was about the same and never really supported his wife in anything. He'd stay out all night and get drunk while my mother was locked in the house alone. We had a joint family then. There were four small houses that shared the same piece of lawn. Grandma used to stay in one of them with her only son who never married a girl while her other three sons used to reside in the neighboring houses. This part is important because my grandma could visit my mom and give her a hard time about everything while my dad was not around. She used to back up her son's abusive nature and getting drunk.

Once, while my dad was abroad for a business trip. My mom took us to a small trip with one of my distant paternal uncle. My dad had no idea about this. My maternal aunts accompanied her there. (yeah, crazy. I know.) One of my maternal aunt ended up marrying that uncle later on. My dad came back from abroad and found out that we had gone to a long trip with that uncle. He accused my mom of sleeping with him. My mom denies and I trust her because she was there with us. Also, that uncle used to like my mom's sister. So yeah. Anyway, shit got out if hand and all. That uncle came to know about how my dad got all furious and abusive at my mom. He called the police that came to our home to arrest my dad. The place where I live, this is a matter of disrespect. They didn't arrest him as grandma explained what had happened. A lot used to happen like this. I can't type 300 pages now and you don't wanna read those. 

I can go on and in about hundreds of stories of what I've seen. But, I'll just say, I've seen a lot of fights in my family from a very young age. It always used to have a bad effect on me and my other two siblings.

My mom used to cry to us about how she had sacrificed herself just for us. She would've left my dad if it weren't for us; told us never to be like our dad or like anyone in this family. On the other hand, my grandma always used to tell us not to be like our mom and how her family was crap and all. I never had a role model or someone to look up to my whole life.

I promised myself I'll be successful in life, will never be like my father, treat women with respect and never touch drugs or drink. I stand by some of these till now. I'm in high school and have never puffed one cigarette. Yeah, I know I'm a wimp. But I have this fear that I'll turn out like my dad. My dad stopped smoking after he had survived his first heart attack though.

You might be thinking what an arsehole of a man my dad is and he is the reason behind all this. Tbh, I wish it were that simple. I'll jump back into the present timeline because I don't want to make this even more long than it already is.

My mom, being impulsive and having anger management issues, used to yell and make things worse for the family. I mean, you can't really blame her. I think she is a bit mentally ill for having to go through all that mental abuse for a long time.

Now, I'm 19 and my parents are sorta afraid of me. I'm like a babysitter that has to barge in everytime they start a fight. I scream. I verbally abuse them. Sometimes, I shove them away. I broke my father's phone once. They remain silent and break it off. I go to my room and cry like a baby. A ""tough guy"" crying for why he has to do this and behave so harshly towards his parents. Sweet talk never worked. I stopped talking to my mom after she had blamed me for everything and a few other series of events. I still don't talk to her. She just calls me for dinner and stuff. I can't stand her but I still love her. My sister and I also stopped talking for a long time because of one incident. Same goes with my brother. Yeah, crazy family, right? No one gets along. 

There is a very recent incident that has pushed my depression up the roof. My mom found a photo of my dad with an Asian girl on his phone while he was on a business trip to China. This incident started a mess once again. My mother left the home for her father's house (this has happened a thousand times). My father got her back again. They don't really love each other. They're just staying under the same roof for their children. I think that's quite stupid tbh. A divorce would've been very peaceful compared to all this drama.

After a few months of that incident, my mom accused my dad of having an affair with a woman. My dad denied and told her to show proof. All she had was a suspicious pattern of my dad's weekly schedule and a phone number which she had called and screamed at. That phone number never picked up ever again. My mom brought her brother into this who eventually fixed everything for us. And, according to my mom, her brother had tracked that woman down and confronted my father about it.

Fast forward a few more months, my dad finds out that one if his friend was calling my mom day after day. Weird because my mom never really had much friends since my dad's family kept her like a prisoner. We got really pissed at her for doing this behind all our backs. They never slept or anything. It's just a bad practice for a wife to call random men where I live. I never really confronted anyone regarding these because I have had enough. I don't talk to this family much. I eat alone in my room. I stay alone in my room 98% of the time. I go out to bring food. I have isolated myself.

I used to be a bright, organized student. I used to be on the top scorers list. My grades started to fall after class 5. Now, I'm in class 12. I have failed in two subjects. It's not like I don't understand maths or physics or chemistry, it's just, I can't focus in anything anymore. My attention span has become close to zero. My mind wanders about how miserable my life has become. I never stay happy. Even if I'm out with my friends, it suddenly hits me that I'm a bag of shit. They're going to be successful in life and I'll just be struggling here for not studying. I can't study. I got myself a new gaming rig to help my mind of this shit. It never helps. I used to live reading books as a child. Now, I just can't focus. Sometimes, I find a relatable story to a part of my life and have a mental breakdown. I cry alone in my room. I have formed this mask that I wear every day. I'm a tough guy outside. So tough and stable that most of my friends come to me with all their life problems. They say I'm easy to talk to. I try to help them through it and I do. All if them think I lead the most perfect life as they have never seen me to get sad. ""Life's great."" is what I tell them. I never talk about my family to them. I have the fear of getting judged. Also, even if I vent about my problems to them, they really can't help me here, can they? I got off from a phone call with one of my friends. She's been going through a tough time and calls me every time she needs someone to talk to. These used to help me to forget about my life. I ponder over the problems of others and help them with it. I've never quite helped myself or asked for help. 

Most of my guy friends that had depression used to vent to me. Now, they vent to the girls they're dating. Dating is a no-no for me as well. I don't want my girl to bear my mess. I fear I'll never be a successful man and will only cause her to suffer later in the life. She'd be better off with someone else who's not suffering from severe depression. I try to be the person that's always there for someone but, I don't want anyone to go through my mess with me. As I said, they won't resolve my family issues. 

Oh also, my dad's side if the family practices black magic. What's that? You're confused? Yeah. Me too. I don't know what to believe. But there are some proof that my grandma and her sister practices these rituals. My mom says she has cursed this family and disputes occur only for this. My maternal grandma forced me to wear a holy Ta'wiz (amulet) around my waist to protect myself from these. My mom has urged us to cut off relationships with all my paternal relatives. It hurts doing that considering how close I am with one if my paternal aunts. She's like a second mom to me and has always loved me from my childhood. Now, I don't talk to her at all. Ignore her calls and messages. I don't know if she's evil or practices black magic. Part of me does not want to believe in all these but part of me does, given the series if events and proof. Hence, I've just isolated myself from any familial relationships. 

I feel like it was a mistake to be born here and I don't belong here. I feel alone. Suicidal thoughts engulf me sometimes but I'll never take that path because I make myself believe in my religion. Sometimes I wish I died in an accident or something. I just don't know what to do. I can't sleep. I've developed a tendency to stay up all night or sleep very less. Sometimes, I sleep for 14 hours straight. My parents know all these. I guess they're just nit aware that I'm suffering from depression or they are, because I had mentioned this to them once while I was screaming at them to stop fighting. I feel like my sanity is slipping away. I have a physics re-test in two days and I can't focus a bit. If I fail this time, I'll have to repeat a whole year again. 

No one has ever been there for me. Mostly because, no one can see through this ""Life's never been better"" mask of mine.

I've struggled with autoimmune disease and mental illness for a long time, and it has taken its toll. Those things have been playing off of each other a long time, with the autoimmune diseases exacerbating my mental health issues, and the consequences of poor mental health exacerbating my autoimmune diseases. Oh, have pretty bad gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia too. After years of depression, anxiety, and manic bipolar episodes, I got to the point where I felt I needed to kill myself because I saw no way out. Turned to hallucinogens to try and comfort myself until I had the courage to do it. Last night was supposed to be another drug-induced escape from my bullshit, but things didn't go as intended. I hit rock bottom. For whatever reason, I decided to try DMT last night. Did it orally with a MAOI not unlike ayahausca. Had a fairly strong trip which quickly went south as the nausea started to pick up. Turns out, becoming a fat lard spending your Saturday night tripping balls in the bathtub desperately holding onto your sanity and fighting the urge to puke is what it takes to hit rock bottom. Just hope this experience doesn't escape my memory any time soon, because I can't afford for this cycle to continue any longer. Suicide is nothing more than an untimely descent into madness, it's not the solution. Sometimes the primal desire to fight for your own survival is what it takes to snap you out of a negative mindset. We all have to beat it somehow. And honestly, I'm grateful this is how it happened as opposed to a failed suicide attempt. Could've been so much worse.;Yup_Im_Depressed_Lol

This ""X"" is someone who used to be in our class but moved away. They used to be my friend too, but I cut it off after they became an asshole, but my closest friend still talked (talks?) with X and I was hurt.

Ever since late October - early November, I've gone through a cycle of sadness. I feel a spike in happiness, but then it slowly declines until something happens that puts me into a deep state of melancholy and hopelessness, which continues until something happens that makes me really happy, and the cycle repeats again. I at least know enough to realize that it's because of the fact that I feel lonely, so usually, the cycle correlates with social interaction. Sometimes I've been able to shake the cycle, like when I told how I felt to my parents, and have been able to feel happy for a good timespan, but it always comes crawling back. Last night I had a bad ""relapse"" of this cycle.

&#x200B;

For some background info, I'm a high school male who does his best to be cheerful and happy around others. I like when others like me, and I want to have as many friends as possible. I'm extremely caring, and try to comfort or lend an ear to those who are feeling down. I've had girls on occasion tell me I'm very sweet and cute, but in a friend sort of way.  I've never had a girlfriend, but I've had many crushes in the past, most of which I've never taken further than a simple exchange of words from time to time. I have a steady group of friends, both male and female. Many people say I'm extremely smart, and I guess this is true to an extent, as I care about my grades and put in some effort, getting straight A's, but I feel that people give me too much credit, I have a hard time understanding math in particular, and I tend to overthink things.

&#x200B;

That brings me to what has happened lately.

&#x200B;

There's been this girl that I really like, from what I hear she's really sweet, and she's one of the most stunning girls I've ever seen. I could go on and on about how pretty she is. I first noticed her last year and tried to talk to her, but I felt like I was annoying her and soon stopped. I told myself that I would get over it, but I've felt my crush on her return. Yesterday, by pure accident, I sent her a video of my failing to snap my fingers that was for a friend. I decided to take the opportunity to start a conversation with her, and it seemed like everything was going at least okay, she showed at least a bit of interest, and I was hopeful. I woke this morning to find that she had left me on read to a message that I had sent her before I fell asleep. Ever since, I've felt crushed, like I'm not enough, or a stupid idiot that can't even get a girl interested in a simple conversation. I feel like everyone can manage to get a lover but me. 

&#x200B;

I suck at getting a girlfriend because I suck. I'm not as funny as some friends who have partners, nor am I as good looking or charming as others. I'm just me, and me is not enough to get jack shit done. I don't blame anyone else for this, I'm who I am right now because of decisions I have made in my life, and I alone am responsible for them. The girl left me on read because she wasn't interested, and that's not here fault, its mine for not being interested enough.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to feel my happy attitude fade right now. I feel fake for trying to keep this up because I'm not happy.

&#x200B;

It goes further than that, though. I display a cheerful attitude because I like to have my peers like me, and I like being happy, but deep down, I'm truly unhappy. I don't want to share this side with anyone because if I'm unhappy, then what reason is there to befriend me. I'll just be another depressing loser at my school. Along with that, I don't feel comfortable sharing my feelings with others, it just feels awkward and strange to me. I'm more than willing to hear everyone else's problems and support them, but I don't feel like I'm comfortable for people to hear my own. I once saw a post that read ""Loneliness isn't about not having friends, it's about not having someone you can tell everything to"". I agree with that wholeheartedly, I have nobody that I feel comfortable telling my deepest feelings to. That's why I've wanted a girlfriend for the past couple of months, I want a mutually supportive relationship.  But it seems that for the foreseeable future, that's just a pipe dream. 

&#x200B;

I don't know why I'm finally sharing my feelings here rather than to someone I know, I guess this just feels easier. Maybe somebody out there is feeling what I'm feeling, and they won't feel as if they're completely alone. Maybe someone will provide some insight that would be helpful.

&#x200B;

Have I ever thought about harming myself in any way? No, but I sometimes think about how people would react if I died. Obviously, people would be sad, very sad, but am I really that important? I daydream sometimes about doing great things, bringing change, solving problems that others failed to solve. I know that these are also pipe dreams. I'll probably be an average person, and if I'm lucky, I might be able to find someone to love, but that seems up in the air at this point. 

&#x200B;

Like I said, I don't know if I have depression. I might have bipolar disorder, as I'm fairly sure my mother does too, along with the fact that I experience mood swings between happy and sad. All I know for sure is that I'm lonely, and it seems like there is no end in sight.";jAnSb0B

Well that's how I'm feeling now, certainly the state I'm in ain't as bad as most, and my upbringing probably want as bad as most of the heinous stuff other redditers have been through but this shit still hurts me. 

For as long as I can remember I've been bullied by girls and boys alike, judged, tormented, called names, and just been the butt of most jokes(up until like yr 9 which is 13-14 where I got big), but surprisingly I got it worse from the girls, always calling me 'weird' which arguably back then I was,  and said I was ugly, annoying, and just in general got laughed at alot. Now whilst going through all this I've never really had many friends, I'd say about 7 real friends spanning my whole life, each drifting in and out of it over time, and I never really had one person to talk to about being the butt of all these jokes, and how much they're effecting me. In turn i missed a lot of school because i just didn't want to be put through it.

Whilst all this shit is going on my family is slowly breaking down, my parents fighting every night, my only brother left at home not giving a shit about it, and just going on as normal whereas I was a shit show, especially when my dad tried to kill himself. Still no one knew about any of the stuff in my life and mostly still don't and I dotn talk to anyone about it and I'm 18 now and I'm just hurting... like I have no actual friends (the people I hang around with all ditched me in yr 11 i was 16 and they ghosted me for a whole year which made me have bad trust issues) 

I cant interact with girls face to face because of all the trauma I've faced from bullying from other girls when I was younger, and I know this because I talked to this girl for a while, and were both going great were happy but we went on a trip to barcalona with the college and I couldn't interact with her at all unless I was drunk. She called it quits a week later (apparently because shes not over her ex, but imo that just seemed like a convenient excuse to dup on my boring quiet ass) I mean I'm over her now but the principles there I cant have any real interactions with people, make friends, or have a relationship because I'm just so fucked in the fucking head. And it's just making me feel like pure shit. And I assume that other people will relate but I just feel like I want to die, but I dont want to die? Like I want to be alive just not exist. Idk it weird. But I just dont see how I can get past this stage in my life. It's just an to big barrier, and I feel like I should just stay away from relationships, new friendships and just be lonely and just chug along being the guy with no friends or partner, even though I want friends and a relationship I just think I'd be too boring and quiet for them to like me... idk.... I guess I just dotn know what to do...

I basically do glamorous call centre work and collect debt from people. It's brutal, I haven't been trained properly and it causes me insane amounts of stress. I sincerely believe that this job has worsened my mental health issues, leading to another nervous breakdown this week.

I have told my boss about my mental health issues and she has been supportive, but I guess I don't know what to do from here.

953;Spiraling backwards;1;bies73;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bies73/spiraling_backwards/;0;2019-04-28 16:12:33;"Long story short - I have been having an awful semester. I started cutting and was just crying all the time. Part of the reason for this was feeling hurt from my friends. I was trying to explain to one of them how they hurt me, but they just trivialized everything to ""being in my head"" and really made it seem like they did nothing to hurt me. This friend is also someone I have gone to about my cutting now that I have started. I have spent the past few weeks trying to get my friend to realize how they have hurt me because their ignorance just felt insulting. Anyways, I finally reached a point in the semester where I felt genuinely happy. I even stopped cutting! Then, I wrote my friend this letter, which looking back, was written very depressingly but the purpose had been to convey that the friend did not seem to care for our friendship and it hurts that they do this to me and I no longer want to feel this way and continue ""crying and cutting"" about a relationship that is inevitably over. That letter prompted my friend to grow concerned for me (so apparently they DO care) and report me to an RA. Now, campus staff know and are forcing me to create an action plan with them that includes going to therapy (which I already started going to on my own) and it just makes me feel like I'm under the spotlight.

I'm upset because I know my friend was trying to help me, but they only made things worse. I was at a good point in my life and recovery, but unknowingly, I suppose, they just pushed me right back to where I started or at least that's how I feel. Every day I am fighting the urge to not spiral backwards (my grades are finally getting better but I am losing motivation...), but it makes me frustrated because I was in a good place before they intervened.

954;Feeling lost;2;bierps;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bierps/feeling_lost/;2;2019-04-28 16:11:18;"&#x200B;

So I've struggled with depression for about 3 years and it has fluctuated from mild to severe in that time period

I have managed to live with it for the most part however these past few months I seem to have completely lost grip of my life. My relationship has fallen apart due to my illness and she has moved on quickly which hurts like hell. I drink and use drugs more often than I ever have to escape my problems because i'm not scared of what could go wrong. I impulsively attempted suicide after a particularly heavy day of drinking 2 weeks ago and it has worried my friends and family.

I am currently taking antidepressants (celexa) and going to cognitive behavioural therapy but it doesn't seem to be working out for me. I am going to my last therapy session tomorrow and whilst initially it seemed like it was going well I am spiralling into the darkness very quickly and at the moment it seems my next suicide attempt is more of a when than an if, although this time I aren't proud to say I won't make the mistake of failing.

So i'm here to vent. I want to get my feelings out and try articulate them even if no one reads or responds (although it would be nice to hear some thoughts or ideas on how I can get myself out of this.)

So, firstly - my relationship. I can't blame anyone for this except myself, even if it hurts and makes me so angry when I see her with her new interest. Throughout the relationship I was distant, I found it hard to get out and do things with her. I assured her it wasn't her and that it was my illness making me feel this way, and that I loved her. She waited for me for a long time, but after countless discussions of how it was making her feel, I made her hard decision easy by letting her go. She was too good for me, I hate how I made her feel, how lonely she was, I hate how much she loved me because I am a piece of shit who couldn't see what I had and now she's gone I feel awful for putting her through it. I still love her, and every night my emotions take over and I get thrown into a mix of ugly emotions, such as rage, regret, jealousy and sadness. This makes me drink, and I drink until I have forgotten my problems and passed out. I know how hard this is for me because I was in a similar situation with my ex girlfriend and that made me feel very low. I hope she's happy but I hope she doesn't forget me, because that would break my heart even more.

Secondly, my suicide attempt. It's the second time that my reckless decisions have nearly taken my life. The first was  a serious overdose on a cocktail of illicit drugs, the second was a desperate attempt due to having a breakdown after a night of drinking (overdosing on my antidepressants and taking ketamine/mdma and drinking a lot of alcohol.) I thought I was at my lowest before I took the overdose but damn, waking up in hospital alone was a whole lot worse. I was in a lot of pain and in a state of confusion, I didn't know what was going on and I had no one I knew around me to tell me. As scary as this was, ever since I can't shake this feeling off that I should have died. The life I'm living now is borrowed time, because I don't want to live, I can't handle my illness for much longer. Especially not on my own. The only person who made me feel better was my ex girlfriend and she has now gone, and I don't blame her. It's hard to love someone who is going through something like this. She never understood fully how I felt because it's impossible for me to tell her. I can't describe the turmoil I go through every day, and that must have been very hard for her. I just hope she knows I love her and that it had to happen for her to live a happy life.

I'm just at the end of my rope. I have tried holding on, tried having hope, but nothing seems to be working. It's a dark road and i'm lost on it, I don't know where to go from here. I can't see a saving grace, even though I have friends and family who love me. It's just all too much to handle and I wanted someone to know so I posted here. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far I guess, hope you're doing well. If you are going through anything, for what it's worth I love you as a person and hope you can find the light.";scottzeh

I’m having trouble recovering from an extremely painful break up even though it was a year ago.

I suppose I should at least give a bit of detail before I get started. I’m 20 years old and I suffer from Aspergers and bipolar disorder and unlike other people with bipolar my mood can shift from happy to extremely depressed in almost an instant at any time and for any length of time without any sort of trigger. My parents had divorced a year after I was born and I was bullied daily for about half my life. To put it simply isolation is no stranger.

About a year ago I began dating a girl whom I had fawned over for my entire high school life and to be honest with her I was truly happy in a way I had never felt before not even in past relationships. Time passed and we eventually moved in together (against my families wishes) and had gotten an apartment together, we even had a stray cat we found together and took care of. As time passed through I noticed her become more distant and spent more time with others and next to none with me. I’ll spare all the details but eventually things came to a head and she tried to leave while I was asleep I had woken up though and pleaded with her to stay and explain what was wrong as she wasn’t willing to and eventually I just let her leave and she promised she would come back after we had some time apart. 3 days later I got a text from her telling me it was over and that I had four hours to leave. With the help of my ex and now best friend funnily enough she helped me pull it together and get out with my cat as well. As we were leaving she showed up with cops in tow I guess to make sure I left and we haven’t spoken since. Afterwards she went around telling my friends and others I was abusive and my “friends” weren’t my friends anymore after that though some saw through it but not many.

Now here I am a year later I patched things up with my family and am staying with my grandparents until I’m able to be self sufficient. To be honest though I don’t know how to do that my trust in both myself and others is still utterly shattered and I now avoid the very things I also desire companionship of any kind. I still miss my ex despite also hating her in a way and nowadays I just feel stuck wanting to die but not being able to because of the family and very few friends I have left. I’m just not really sure what to do with myself anymore and while I’m going to a therapist at the behest of my father starting Wednesday I’m so scared it won’t help. I don’t want to be alone in life but now people just scare me if someone anyone could just tell me how I’m supposed to get through this and rid myself of my pain and fears I would be in your debt.";BitMitter

This is more of a rant using a throwaway account. Feel free, seriously, not to reply or anything. Some family know my regular username, and some friends, hence the need. I just need a vent, really. 

I've lost... ah, fuck it. So much. Like, not in comparison to some people, either or this sub (I'm sure), or those not living in currently sunny London, but instead in some war-torn area, but... well, it's loss to me, so it hurts. 

Former career? Gone. Taken from me by my family, after I'd spent years of my life working toward it and thousands of pounds on it. That really hurts. Now I've settled for... 4th best? 

Former promising sporting venture? Gone. Got injured. Never recovered fully. Now will never recover. Take care of your joints, people. It sounds petty but I was having a blast, and now there is 0% chance I will ever get to compete and be able at my former level. It was my go to, after my former career fell through. It sounds stupid, I know, but I really liked it, and it gave me something. 

Living in some shitty room with no space, all the while my two parents and two step-parents sit pretty with big houses, and my two siblings are more than well cared for and sorted for the future. I expect nothing financially, for the record, but they damned well know I have nowt from all I spent on my former career. To the tune of £20,000. If I had that back, I could help myself. 

Grandad died recently. I watched it happen. Heart failure. Tell you what, there's not much worse than watching a frail 95-year-old gasping for air every two mins because his heart is barely able to sustain life. I cried once, but only a little. To be honest, losing him (despite us being more father/son than I am with my actual dad) was just another kick to the curb, which I just accepted as my lot. I was beyond sadness, though. I even called him (we spoke twice a week on the phone about random crap, usually) after his death twice  out of habit, only to be greeted by a voicemail and the remembering that grandad weren't alive anymore. 

Her funeral was shit too. I sat there playing umpire whilst my mum and to-be husband got sniped at by my highly bully like and petulant step-father. Truth be told, I nearly decked him. Wish I had.

And the final kicker? I lost the love of my life some time ago, to this shitty disease called depression. No getting her back. She's gone. 

That's all led to me not feeling my best, I won't lie. I wouldn't mind, but the only thing I really want is to start repairing each bit. I've started, to be fair, but the one thing I can't do is form relationships. It's like that part of my brain has just shut down completely. I've pushed away two genuinely great women because we got close and I didn't know how to deal with that emotion anymore. 

So yeah... rant over. Job. Sport/other job. Relationships (or the now lack of them). Family. It's gone well!";throwaway768305

I am 16 years old and when the new year started I had the feeling that everything will get better this year because in the last one happened a lot of bad stuff. And for the first few months it really got better: I made new friends and I also met a girl I fell in love with (I will mention her later in this story). But since around the start if march things went down so fast that I could start crying again. It all started with a party, where I and the mentioned girl slept in the same bed together (no we hadn't any sexual contact) and we cuddled and the next morning was the best moment I had in my entire life. But after a few days when I asked her if we are a couple noe she answered that she has some problems in the moment and that she still is very unsure how much she likes me. And that is okay for me because I can't and won't blame her for her feelings and she also had a very hard year 2018. But since then some I call them ""dark thoughts"" took place in my head that say, that she doesn't like me, that I am just an annoying piece of sh*t and so on. When I told her that (a good friend of mine suggested that after I wrote about that with him) she said that she is very sorry that she dragged me into her problems and that she doesn't know how to help me, but that she will help me if I need it. But these ""dark thoughts"" don't stop at only the topic of love but also show me something like a bad or maybe real version of myself. The more days pass, the stronger I feel lonely (even if I know that there are people that care about me), useless because I don't have any talents that are important for a future job, broken, left behind, forsaken, lost. But all that reached a new level last week when i had something like a panic attack, where this ""dark thoughts"" nearly screamed that I should cut myself and all these things I explained before. I was able to resist this desire under tears. But it left me more broken and desperate. I talked with my best friends about that (also my crush) and my crush gave me some advices how to deal with a panic attack. But I can't say if they'll help next time because there isn't passing a day without thoughts about cutting myself or just ending it all. I even made plans on how I would kill myself but I think I wouldn't do that in the next time because there is something like a last hope inside me. But most time I just feel empty because of doing nothing because even the tiniest thing I have to do produces an extreme high amount of stress. And I don't know if I could tell my parents because I think I don't want to get any ""professional help"" from a doctor or something because I would just feel more like a freak who's unable to live a normal life. Also something awful is that I feel like I don't have any talents even if I am doing Kempo (a traditional japanese martial art without hard body contact and I have the first black belt in this) because sometimes I am unable to give 100% of my power and I never had something like this before. And when a friend of mine does something awesome, cool or better than me I start to feel like crap and uninteresting because it seems that I don't achieve anything. For example when a friend makes a cool comment in class or just do something and getting attention and acclaim for it. The only time I don't feel like that is when I do something funny with my friends or when I have ti give some Kempo lessons for the kids group that I have to teach because the kids make me happy with their power, enthusiasm and happiness and I also can't and don't want to be a bad role model for them. But when I am in school again for example I start to feel crappy again. These thoughts about hurting myself torture me and I don't know how long I can resist this horrible desire. I don't know if you can call this depression and would it help me to know that? I don't think so but it definitely is a big problem for me. If you read this I hope you're doing better and I want to thank you for paying attention.

Edit: Also when my friends say that they will care about me and love me I feel bad in a few hours.";TheGreatestYee

I apologize if this post is long, and ambiguous.  I just slowly feel losing myself and I keep feeling like something is stuck in my heart, and I keep looking into the wall and spacing out.

During highschool, I was very motivated, positive, and a happy individual.  I would say my key strength was how decisive I was. My parents were always out of house working, and I was always left alone with videogames. I grew fond of them and how intricate some of them were. My brother went off to college and I was alone until 9pm on some days. I never resented my parents for negligence since I knew they were working for the well being of the family.

&#x200B;

College came, I decided to try Comp. Sci like my brother did. He was already done with college and had landed a few internships. I thought to myself: There is nothing a human can do if the person is determined and put his mind to it. I ended the semester with a B+ in Comp. Sci. I was happy.

&#x200B;

Second semester came and I got obliterated by the second level Comp Sci course. The TA hours overlapped with my English course. I didn't go to any english courses and focused on Comp Sci. It wasn't going well. I decided that If I struggle in 2nd level course, the higher I went the more I would suffer. Besides, I didn't even learn anything myself..I did everything I could to get help. I befriended nerds, played games with them, ate lunch with them to get all the help I needed to pass the weekly projects. I wasn't happy. I withdrew from the Semester since I had failed English and had gotten something like a D on comp sci.

&#x200B;

I took a break for 6 months, working in Dunkin / Starbucks to find out what I liked. I didn't find out, and decided to try Math since I was confident in my math skills.

&#x200B;

I went back to college, first semester went fine, then second semester I got shit on again. I currently withdrew and I am home now.

&#x200B;

I coped with video games when things were hard. It helped me occupy my mind and I passionately liked, and still like video games to this day. I could go on for more than 10 hours, even 24 hours if I really wanted to.

&#x200B;

I am searching for my third major now. I am sad, and dissapointed in myself at how I couldn't get anywhere when people around my age are graduating or are heading for their senior year in college. My family decided to move my computer to living room so I could study and get a real estate salesperson license. They are restricting me from video games. I don't even know what it is, but over the years I became less confident, less decisive, and my head got fucked. I don't even know what the point of writing this is. The past months have been the worst since I failed, I made my parents waste money on me, my father had a stroke (he is okay now but it was a painful experience), things with my girlfriend have been tough, and more. 

&#x200B;

I think I cling onto video games since it gives me a sense of achieving something. I compete at the very highest level, and every decision I make in game that leads me to victory gives me satisfaction. Now that I can't play games, maybe I am feeling down for not being able to escape my continuous failures in life.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend's dog is also dying and I need to be there for her. But I end up feeling worse for trying to make her feel better and feel worthless. I usually end up staring into the wall and not being able to think anything. By that I mean I try to think something, but  I can't because I don't know where to begin or what to think.

969;Girlfriend has depression;1;bie9hz;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bie9hz/girlfriend_has_depression/;1;2019-04-28 15:24:50;"So here goes nothing, I’ve tried a lot of things but have frayed away from social media until now. I’m seeking advice. 

My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years has seeking depression and anxiety. We live together and are fairly young too, (20, 21). I work full time for a large company, go to college part time, and I’m working to start a business of my own. She works part time at 2 companies (maybe 30 hours or less a week), does not go to college and complains all the time about how tired she is. Needless to say, I pay all of my bills and some of hers too because she doesn’t make much money. 

Her depression isn’t without reason, she knows it frustrates me that she can’t hold a good job, pay her own bills, and help with rent.  She also has put on weight recently and is very upset with her own body even though I tell her I love her body everyday. She also does not have close family near where we live (even though she’s not really close with anyone in her family). It’s basically her, me, and my family where we live. 

What really bothers me the most is it feels like she’s taking advantage of me. It always seems that I’m doing the house work, I’m cooking, I’m paying for everything while she barely does any of that. If I say something about it, she breaks down and gets mad and doesn’t talk to me. 

The thing is, I’m compassionate. I get the spot she’s in. She doesn’t like her jobs and she barely has money. But to any reasonable person, the answer to that is to either find a better job and or work more. But she doesn’t do that, she just complains. This takes a toll on me because in my eyes, she has it easy and it when I address this to her, again she blames her depression.

I’ve researched depression quite a bit since dating her, i understand it’s an illness and it has to be treated. By no means do I think she’s lying to me when she tells me that everything she is doing or isn’t doing is because she’s so depressed. 

I’ve talked to her about getting help and her physician knows and has given her medicine but it doesn’t help. I asked her to make an appt with a psychiatrist but she doesn’t want to do that claiming that “she won’t have the motivation to go”. I’d take her myself if I wasn’t so busy all the time. 

I don’t do this often but I’m seeking advice and wisdom from fellow Reddit users. I feel stuck, she’s far away from her family, we have a dog, an apartment together and I haven’t been happy lately. I would be happier if I didn’t have to worry about her as much. If she paid her own bills and helped me with joining expenses like rent and groceries. I would be happier if she was happier.

I've been on antidepressants for around 3 years now.I have scheduled appointment with my doctor to talk about my medication and maybe even quitting it.

But the thing is... I don't know if I am ready for it. I want to quit them because the side effects are getting on my nerves. They aren't THAT bad but after three years I've had enough. I'm really forgetful now days (and TMI: my periods got really bad when I started my medication) etc. (BTW: I've also forgot to take my medication, because of my medication. Irony) 

For the past few months I've felt tired, sad and numb. I don't talk to my friends after school, I just play videogames. Of course this might be because school is about to end and last essays etc. are piling up. But it feels like I am ''falling back to my old life'' and I'm not sure if this is temporary or not. 

Any advice?

It's a long post so would really appreciate it. It might be long since I tend to go off topic easily. 

I always have negative thoughts about myself and my future in my head. It all started in 2017 when I had the worst possible year I could have. My last year in high school ended up with me failing in math which forced me to drop for a year and sit at home and do nothing but prepare for the retest again next year. Sitting at home for a whole year depressed me to the point where I literally became emotionless. Nothing seemed to make me happy or sad and everything was just ""meh"". 

I thought I'd end up taking some courses but and was excited too. But only for a while. Blame - sitting at home. I'd stay up late at night, sometimes up till 5/6 in morning doing nothing but just scrolling through social media and YouTube. I had no friends in my city too. I did have a couple in school. One was my classmate and best friend. And one was a friend younger than me. They both did try to help me but them not being physically present didn't do much. And at the end I stopped telling them about my feelings. My retest came in March last year and results came in May. I cleared. Was a little happy. Only because I FINALLY cleared high school..

Got enrolled to a college in June and started in July. The first month went normally and wasn't really exciting except for the new college feel. The first week I got to know I won't get good friends whom I could trust upon. We had a ""bridge course"" in the first month. It was nothing study related. Just that we could get used to college life. On the last day of the bridge course, I met a girl in my class. We exchanged numbers because I had to send her pics of our class and a professor teaching it for our bridge course report. We start talking and now we've been in a relationship for 7 months. 

All this time I was literally an open book to her telling everything about myself and my past and all. And it did kinda help me. But after a while, even that stopped. It felt like no matter who I talked to, nothing would help. I've started hiding my emotions and thoughts a lot more now for the past month or so since I've ever did. I keep most things to myself and let little out. I don't want to continue like this and end up ruining my college life and my potential career.

976;I'm in a stage where I just want to smoke weed and play video games but my brain knows that this is not possible. I think I need some help or advice.;2;bie006;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bie006/im_in_a_stage_where_i_just_want_to_smoke_weed_and/;0;2019-04-28 15:00:30;"I just felt the need to talk to someone so here it goes.


I was born and raised in the country. My parents were working all day long until the sun came down and it was time for bed. I'm from the Balkans and a lot of the families here were/are poor by default and mine was no exception. I was never needy but shame is a feeling you can't escape from when you are the poor kid in school. This had an effect on my education as well and I barely made it through school. When it was almost over I realized that I fucked up and that I will probably be working in some low-budget restaurants for the rest of my life.


The lucky circumstance in my fucked up life is that I could watch TV all day and a local TV station was broadcasting CartoonNetwork where I learned the English language on my own. This encouraged me to seek online jobs and eventually I got into marketing. It was fantastic for a year, I learned a ton of new stuff and was making more money than anyone I know. I even started helping my parents with some cash that I could spare. This was the peak of my life, financially and morally. Everything I wanted as a kid was available and affordable but I later figured out that money can't keep you happy very long.


About a year ago I realized that I hate my job. No one told me that moral and marketing don't go along very well so I started weeding out my clients. I kept the ones that were selling useful products and stopped working for the other guys. This had an impact on my financial situation and I moved to a smaller apartment but nothing changed. My depression was developing fast and I was aware of it but there isn't anyone you could talk to. People here are very conservative and as soon as you tell them that you might be feeling depressed they tell you to fuck off, get a beer or pop some pills. The therapsts aren't helpful as well. I had a long chat with a lovely lady a few months back and she was amazed that I am aware of all this stuff but can't get through my depression. I don't blame her for prescribing pills but they aren't working. The people I hang out with are also very conservative and can't understand how someone who makes 5-10 times more than they do can even think about depression. So I'm now left with 3 close friends that understand me to some extent. One of them is with me every single day and most of the time we just smoke some weed and play video games. Those are the only two things that can still make me happy and trust me, I have tried everything. From going out to making parties at my place. I just don't feel relaxed around people and I also think that could be my anxiety slowly developing as well.

I am sorry for this long post but I had to let it all out. Right now, I am one rent behind and slacking at work as much as I can. Just 10 minutes before I decided to post here I was trying to work on a marketing campaign but I just can't. It feels so meaningless, hard, annoying... I can't explain it but you are probably familiar with the feeling.


If there is anything that you think would help please share it in the comments. So far I have tried the things I mentioned above along with exercise, yoga and meditation. As a temporary solutions there were helpful but nothing lasts more than a few hours. After that I'm back to thinking about the meaning of life and is it actually worth it.";calderh18

At the end of the day, you've got to do it for yourself because in this world, no one's going to help you."" He said other things too but, now he said it I'm already doing what I can to improve my life. I've been stuck at a bump for god knows how long but now I want to change that. I never listened to people's advice and I've been letting down others, and now I want to do it for them and myself, because happiness is a reward that is ridiculoisly hard to get, but is worth it. Because the days where I'm sitting around, doing nothing, are the days that I'm letting myself down. Everytime I wake up late, I'm letting myself down. Everytime I don't leave the house, again, I'm letting myself down. It's going to be really fucking hard to kick it. And it's remarkable because for the past few weeks I'd been planning to top myself. I've tried to before and I regret it. The last time I spent a week in hospital. There's nothing more lonely than being in a hospital bed after trying to kill yourself. And now I fucking promise myself, anything I want is achievable, but it isn't gonna happen waiting for others to do it for me. Life isn't worth giving up on.

I’ve been going through a lot recently. My father died a few days ago. My depression keeps getting worse and worse. And I’m so burnt out in terms of school. My family is in shambles and has little to no money. So the thing is, I had an interview yesterday for a scholarship. The interview went extremely bad. I’ve done about 5 interviews thus far and none of them went like this. There were about 7 or 8 people interviewing me—the most I’ve ever had—and they were all male. I’m a guy myself but just so you guys understand, I’ve only had female interviewers and 1 male interviewer in the past. So it was kinda like new territory for me. I only mention this because my prior interviewers seemed much more easy going. The group of guys that interviewed me were pretty old for the most part and seemed a bit up tight. Anyway though, the interview went horrible. My mind went blank and I felt I wasn’t prepared. Part of that is my fault especially because I didn’t do much preparation. I hate to make any excuse because I do recognize that it was my fault and responsibility, but with my dad, depression, school work and all, I felt that I had so much weighing on my mind and couldn’t really focus on the questions being asked. Also, I have social anxiety so there’s that. It was very traumatizing for me. It almost felt like they were feeding me backhanded compliments and they didn’t seem impressed. They didn’t like me. I was noticeably nervous.  They looked at me like their shit didn’t stink and that something terribly different about me. I probably won’t get the scholarship truthfully. Also, I guaranteed my school counselor hyped me up so I can even have the opportunity to get this scholarship and I don’t want to disappoint her. The interview went so bad that it made my depression worse. I was even considering suicide again yesterday after day, especially with the build up of things I got going on. I’m depressed about many things and one of that things is feeling lonely and not really having anyone that likes me. Sure it’s hard for me to express what’s going on due to my social anxiety and all that, but I always felt no one liked/likes me. I could really use some encouraging words. I keep replaying the interview in my head and I don’t know how to face my counselor tmrw. If you guys need more details, feel free to ask. Thanks for reading this far. Also, if it sounds like I’m making a bunch of bs excuses please say so. Honesty and advice is all I’m looking for. Thanks again!;aceanime

You live with other people, so you go through the motions rather than staying in bed all day or crying for a while, you don't let on how much you're hurting on the inside because they wouldn't get it, or they'd think it could be fixed with an ""I'm here for you"" and a hug then get confused or frustrated when that doesn't work. You don't want to reach out, because the few friends you have you feel like you lean on all the time and they're getting sick of you and will find better friends to spend time with if you keep your shit up. You don't want to talk to anyone about it, because someone ALWAYS has it worse, and even though people SAY that's not an excuse to trod down on someone else's sadness.. that's exactly what they do with it. People ""don't get how you're depressed"" because you have a roof over your head, family that aren't dead or drug addicts, and food on the table, and it just ""doesn't make sense,"" so you stop bothering to tell them and just pretend you're fine. You feel like you're broken in a way no one can fix, yet sometimes you try and fix it with the stupidest things, like throwing food, exercise, being selfless for others instead, whatever hobbies at it, then feel guilty for overindulging in those things and realize it didn't even work.  


That was kind of a stream of consciousness and I'm sorry, but it's hard today. My birthday's coming up soon, and while my mom is kind enough to be trying to organize something even though we're low on money and it's not a ""big"" birthday, I'm just crushed by the awareness that if she didn't do that, no one would give a shit or even know. Last year nobody remembered other than my mom, and my dad probably because she told him. We have a very close-knit extended family, EVERYONE remembers everyone, everyone likes to schedule lunches or get-togethers for everyone's birthday, but when I was alone at a shitty college dorm with a roommate whose friends kept ripping me off and inconveniencing me, only weeks after my grandma (see: light of my life, visited her almost weekly when I could) had died and I had nobody, nobody even bothered to remember. Now I know it was probably my grandma reminding everyone, that no one actually cared, I'm just forgettable. A nothing. Just someone people tolerate and invite to family events because it'd be socially impolite if they didn't, since I'm technically related and all.  


I feel like a disappointment to the few people who actually bothered to put any stock in me, so I basically just reassured them that the others who disregard me and ignore me did right. My mom tells me all the time ""how highly people talk of me"" in the family, but I know that's a lie when I'm just some pathetic college kid barely passing classes who does nothing but grind through work, whine about the work, and then waste my parents' money on an education I don't deserve. I feel like everything is a waste. I was ""fine"" yesterday, or at least I didn't let the thoughts take me over like this, and I don't know why I can't be ""fine"" today. Even if it's fake fine, I'd rather be fake fine for a while than deal with this shit over and over. I just hate myself, I hate all the decisions I make, and I feel like there's NO ONE in my life that's better for having known me (other than maybe a ""Well at least I didn't end up like cyclothymicfirefly haha"" way.)";cyclothymicfirefly

Anyway, I'm going through a tough time and that IME often leads to feelings of depression: not ""being sad,"" but more like being emotionally deadened or muffled, as well as being emotionally fine... and then suddenly incredibly irritable or angry, like Hulk-smash angry, though I'm able to control the smashy part of that at least.

I've also noticed that I tear up really easily, and not in response to any stimuli. Just all of a sudden my eyes tear up, it can be difficult to see, etc. I'm not ""crying"" in that there's no emotional component, and no feeling of release, just kind of leaking from my eyes I guess?

So my questions are, first, are these kinds of symptoms -- emotionally muffled, sudden bursts of irritability, and excessive tears -- typical for depression? \*Is\* there a ""typical""? 

And at what point do I stop just toughing this out (that's what I've always done, knowing the time would pass, etc.) and seek mental health help?

I’m about to start university and recently went to a psychiatrist hoping to get medication for my ADHD to help me focus on school, but the psychiatrist said that most people are usually able to manage their ADHD by the time they reach adulthood. 

She added that the lack of focus, being easily distracted and inability to stick to routines is a symptom of depression (I do have depression and infrequent suicidal thoughts but I’ve been “okay” lately) so she wanted to treat that instead and put me on Fluvoxamine. It’s also supposed to help me sleep better, and I know this may be entirely too early to tell as it’s only the third day, but I still haven’t been able to sleep at night. I feel the same, no energy to interact with people but not actively suicidal either. I’ve googled and it says it’ll take about 8-12 weeks for the antidepressants to take effect. 

What happens then? Those who are on antidepressants, how do you feel? Do they work? Do they make you happier/look forward to living? Do they give you energy? Does it help with focus and concentration? Or are there still days where despite taking them you still feel like you’re better off dead?

But I've done some self-reflection. And I deserve it. I deserve it all. I deserve the loneliness, the fact that I have no friends and that my parents don't actually care unless it effects their social image. I deserve the fact that I've never successful at anything. I deserve how ugly and repulsive I am. I deserve all the bullying I had. I deserve to be depressed. (Although I reckon I'm just making this depression thing up). 

I'm not a good person. I have literally nothing good going for me. I've had horrific thoughts. 

So when I finally die I'll be glad that I'm no longer around to do anything bad. I'll be glad that I never harmed anyone. 

It'll be a good thing for everyone.";Spicy0nions

I'm 20, in college, not very many people to reach out to besides mental health professionals or doctors.

My ribs started to show through and I figured, why not just starve to death? This scared me but what scared me, even more, was how I stopped going to class and used being ""sick"" as an excuse to lay in bed all day.

I’ll distract myself with video games or something. Keeping my mind from focusing on how much shit sucks. I’m always anxious though. Super anxious but I don’t really have panic attacks. 

I don’t think I’ve ever been actually happy. Just distracted from my fucked up brain.  I’ve been struggling for so long. Whenever I get real sad my parents fucking take my phone or some dumb shit. So I put on a mask. Hiding it makes me even more anxious. I’m not allowed to be sad. 

Of course my dad is making me play baseball again. Out of his own selfishness. He signs me up for shit and gets pissed when I don’t want to. He asked me if I wanted to play and I said I wouldn’t mind. He wasn’t ever going to tell me I had a game the next fucking day. All of that’s kind of unrelated though.

993;How to help my boyfriend who is battling depression? How to help myself cope as well?;6;biddol;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/biddol/how_to_help_my_boyfriend_who_is_battling/;3;2019-04-28 14:03:23;"For the first 5 years of our relationship, we were perfect. but then, slowly over the last year or so he's been changing. 

He's a very smart man, in school he had always been top of his class, even one of the hardest physics teachers at our community college was impressed with him and asked him to be a paid Tudor for the school. He has always been so kind to his friends and family and always wants to help. A few years ago I was in a car accident and was in the hospital for a week and he stayed with me every moment sleeping on the chairs in my room. We have gone on month long backpacking trips and have learned to work together as a team.  He used to be an avid sci-fi reader, he used to build these huge RC cars and he was into kites and philosophy and cars ( he has a beautiful little Datsun sport that was once loved and taken care of is now peeling from the sun and cobwebbed and has mold inside :\[ )He was also so upbeat! Optimism poured out of this man like a fountain. But now...?

&#x200B;

He cries maybe 2-7 days out of the week, like epic cries that leave him exhausted. He has insomnia and bearly sleeps and so just lies in bed for 14 hours, and then he feels bad lying in bed all day which makes him more miserable. He has started smoking a LOT of pot, he claims it helps but when he started smoking pot I never notices these sad behaviors. He says mean things to me, and tells me that he's depressed because of me...that even when I don't say anything, he can just FEEL me judging him. He avoids his family like the plague ( which is hard cuz he lives at home ). He refuses to see a therapist, he refuses to get help. He has 20 more weeks total of university before he gets a BA in physics but I fear he wont make it.

&#x200B;

I am afraid to wake him up ( I also live with his family, also in university for a BioChem major. ) He is either mean to me or he will start crying when I wake him up. I try to wake him up with kisses and snuggles and he bats me away, the other day I did not wake him up and he slept till 7:30pm and he said he was mad that I didn't wake him up and he wished I could be more assertive.

I have been working and saving money for such a long time. I have been paying for him almost since we met. I bought his car, I pay for  his insurance, I payed for his classes ( after he failed to fill out the college money aid form) I buy all of the food he eats, I bought all of his clothes the last 4 years, I'm INVESTING in him because I believe in him and I want him to succeed. I try my best to listen when he complains and I try my best not to argue. He says hurtful things though like I'm too fat ( I have a normal bmi) and that its my fault he's depressed. I will say "" what am I doing to make you depressed? , I will stop"" and he gets frustrated and claims that I'm starting ANOTHER argument with him. Like, what? no, I asked what I was doing wrong- and he will cut me off and say that I just don't get it, I just don't understand. and if I push harder he will get up and leave and not talk to me.

these times always makes me cry. what happened? We have been together for so long, why is he acting like this? why now? what's changed?  I suggest therapy and he refuses, I suggest medication and he gets panicked and angry. I suggest a walk and he says "" no...I have to study"" and then lies down in bed. I try to get him up and he bats me away and says mean things to me.

&#x200B;

I have started seeing a therapist for myself about 4 months ago which I admit is helping a little, shes someone to vent to, and we are working on not letting him get to me so much.

I read articles about depression and they say to be supportive but I don't know how? I try to support him but I cant win when he says "" I FEEL you judge me"". I have tried many things after he says this ( he says it often) and they always end up with him upset. He even gets upset when I leave, I tell him that I have to use the restroom or anything to get away without hurting him but he will say "" your just leaving because you are disappointed in me..."" 

wth?? hes never said things like this before, what happened???

This is also taking a toll on me and my own schooling. We both commute 3 hour round trip / day for  school (we do go to different schools but our schools are almost next to each other) and we are both taking really heavy classes. I WANT to join a club and I WANT to volunteer and I WANT to get an internship but he argues that I shouldn't and he gets upset when I talk about them. Then he talks about how he's probably going to fail school. I am missing out in my schooling to avoid making him worse.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do. every day I keep trying. I love him and I'm not looking for anyone to tell me to leave him, please none of that. I am just looking for ideas on how to help.

When I kiss him awake and he bats me away, was that the right thing to do? should I have left him to oversleep? should I keep pushing him to study and do well?

He has told me that, even me suggesting things put him off, should I suggest him to sleep in? 

Therapy is out the window, he will leave the room if I mention the word. This morning I tried to cuddle him and he pushed me away ( he cuddles me all the time though, I just cant cuddle him), should I have pushed me cuddling him? Should I continue pushing him even when he fights back? or should I step back and let him oversleep, miss doing homework, let him feel bad about himself?";honeymyhoney

I haven’t had any issues for several years. I started to notice a few months ago my temper getting shorter, and bursts of anger. Then horrific anxiety that is just nonstop. I started taking Prozac again, and I have an appointment with behavioral therapy next week.

I’ve been taken the Prozac for barely a week. I’m trying to give it a few weeks, but this is horrible. It is taking so long to work, and I feel horrible. At times I can feel it starting or attempting to level out my moods, but what I am feeling intense.

I am someone that isn’t very emotional, I am very logical, and don’t care what other people think. Now, I am paranoid and even bearing the phone ring gives me a panic attack. I even accused my husband of cheating even though I know that isn’t what he is doing or would do. 

I apologized to him about it since I knew it wasn’t the case, but I feel like shit since I can’t control my damn emotions, outbursts, crying spells.. I am overthinking everything, and extremely paranoid. 

I feel like people are looking at me strangely, I dropped two classs I was taking since I can’t concentrate or remember anything. I can see if behavorial therapy will give me an off work order until it mellows out

The pain is just nonstop, and now I’m starting to get insomnia. It’s just that weird achy feeling in your chest, paranoia, crying frequently, it just doesn’t stop.

I do have some stress in my life, but I feel like these issues just won’t go away. I’ve done mediation, relaxation techniques but my body is constantly in fight or flight mode, especially the last two days. 😑. I am worried that Behavorial Therapy won’t be able to help me, and that this pain will be here for the rest of my life. 

I hate it. I’m an independent person, and I have to be reminded to eat something, I feel helpless. I love taking a showering in the morning to wake me up, or when I get off work as a way to relax, and now I’m getting panic attacks over going to take a damn shower.
 
It is so dumb that it is taking me hours to do certain things. It just keeps hitting me over and over and over. I try to push it away, and it basically says NOPE then there’s more crying and emotional outbursts.

I’ve only been taking the Prozac a week at 20mg... so I’m thinking a lot of this is just me (as I’ve experienced this before taking it but not as intense).. and it’s trying to work.

I’m just so tired. I want to be like everyone else,  normal. I want to not start crying uncontrollably for an hour, I would like to eat without feeling like throwing up.. I just want this lump in my throat and heaviness in my chest to go away. 

I’m starting to get insomnia... I’ll have to wait until Wednesday to see a therapist, and possibly call my doctor and see if I can have the next week days off.

I hate this. I hate feeling so vulnerable, and helpless. I know that my thoughts are not logical.. and that my behavior and emotions are insane right now.. but I can’t even control it and it’s frustrating.

Sometimes I feel myself drifting off just staring off, I’m even starting to question if everything is real, this just feels like a dream.

It just won’t stop.";Artemisgalan
