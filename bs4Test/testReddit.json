She genuinely doesn't. What happened could have been considered abusive, so if you're triggered by these kind of things I advise you to stop reading.\n\nIt was September this year, and I finally was diagnosed with depression after a whole year of feeling like crap.\n\nIt happened after I started crying while making some notes in preparation for an exam. And my mom pulled me to go out for a 'walk', and I was too sad and tired to leave, so I begged her not to bring me out. Then it started happening, she started forcing me to change and gave me a slap.  And then she dragged me outside for a walk, and started yelling at me outside, calling me a lot of names such as retard. Then she started to talk about how after I got depressed my dad went through some stress of his own, and basically said I was just doing shit to make my family collapse and said I would be happy if my parents died. She blamed me for diverting my brother's attention away from his studies to care for my mental health, threatened to rip my face off and kill me. Then she started to talk about how when my dad was clinically depressed, she went through a tough time of having to care for the kids and also my dad, and how at one point she took out a knife and cut her arm in front of him due to the stress she was going through, and told me she couldn't take any more torture of this sort and basically told me I was torturing her. I started crying in fear and shock and begged her to let me just go home and I said I didn't want to torture her. Then she slapped me hard(all of this happened publicly) she had me for about two hours outside and it was literally just threats of killing me or hurting me and saying that I was trying to rip my family apart/leave a curse on my residence and so much more. She hit me and bit me outside. I don't remember much she said, but I was terrified and trying to run away from her but I physically couldn't since she was gripping on to my hands and her nails were digging into my skin. I don't know how she gets her ideas that I'm trying to hurt her or the family. I have a mental illness. I don't understand her.\n\nI don't know why I'm sharing this in detail, it's just a thing that floats around in my head around.",
