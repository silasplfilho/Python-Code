          "selftext": "I\u2019m a student in a public school, 14yr M. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m just feeling quite down due to recent events.\n\nLemme give ya\u2019ll a backstory. For most of my life I\u2019ve just been coming home from school to play video games. All my life, I\u2019ve needed some sort of motivation or something to get out of bed in the morning, push through the day, get through all of my school work, etc. That motivation. For me was video games. Whether it\u2019s just talking to my friend while messing about in Fifa or Cod, or being really excited to play through really engaging and beautifully created narratives in games like RDR2 and The Last Of Us. I know this sound kinda weird or something but yeah that\u2019s basically my life.\n\nAfter an argument with my Dad he took away my PlayStation. He\u2019s done this quite a few times in the past and he\u2019s really stubborn and arrogant and he really pisses me of because he will never understand me or even try to. Honestly the only good thing I can say about him is that he pays the bills, he goes to work sometimes, and he very rarely tries to care about me or even acknowledges my existence. This never really affected my siblings and my family isn\u2019t the type that talks about feelings, hence my hesitation towards writing this. I never really talk about my feelings and I always bottle them up, and release them in video games, instead of smashing my house down when I\u2019m feeling angry, I can just turn on God Of War and activate the rage mode and just smash all the enemies into pieces.\n\nSo to recap I play games to:\nA: To get through the day\nB: To have fun or to be captivated in their enticing stories\nC: To release all my negative emotions \n\nGames like God Of War, RDR2, TLOU, etc are really good at getting A,B and C, so I play them a lot. My parents however believe I\u2019m addicted as if were cocaine or something and believe that it\u2019s just a distraction, which is something that I understand why they think that but for me, its so much more than that, its a coping mechanism to their bad parenting. They rarely acknowledge or recognise when I\u2019m going through a bad day and need some support. I just wish I had better parents who understood me and whom I could talk to about this. When I try to initiate a conversation with my Dad he often shuts it down and he argues with me over the littlest things. I can work my ass of and try very hard in school and when a test that I did reflects my hard work, I\u2019m given very little reward for doing it and my Dad just thinks I should be doing it anyway and he doesn\u2019t really care tbh. And then on the other side I can do something remotely bad and I\u2019m met with shouting and lecturing and this really pisses me of so when I play PS4, he thinks that I\u2019m gaining all this rage from it, when in reality its the opposite way round.\n\nI know so many people who put in less than half the effort than I do, and their parents reward them so much more than mine, as they understand how hard our tests are. My father who\u2019s tests were very easy, still failed a lot of them and he has very little appreciation for my hard work and if I get a few marks of, he has the audacity to complain why I didn\u2019t get full marks. I don\u2019t really say much to him as if I did I\u2019d know that I\u2019d get in a very deep conversation with him and he wouldn\u2019t understand and he\u2019d just take it as an insult. I\u2019m not asking for a Lamborghini every time I do good in a test, I\u2019m just asking for appreciation and motivation here and there, and if I\u2019m lucky maybe even a gift every year or so. \n\nIn school I hang around with about like 20 \u2018Friends\u2019. Only about 4-5 of them are real close friend who I often talk to and joke around with. They are good people and I really respect them for understanding me. For the other 15 or so \u2018Friends\u2019 they aren\u2019t really friends as they are people who just make fun of me, they\u2019re not really bullies, they do make fun of me but they just believe its a joke. I get mocked quite a bit in school, I\u2019m not the strongest nor the tallest so they think I\u2019m just an easy target. This never really affected me as I\u2019d just counteract the negative emotions with playing on the PS4 and joking around with my close friends.\n\nAbout a month ago, I got in an argument with my Dad, and long story short he really pissed me of and I said some deep stuff which he took as an insult, and took away my PS4. I was pissed of at first but my mum said I\u2019d probably get it back in a week, so I went through school that week fine. And another week, and another. I realised that this time was different and was upset that I wasn\u2019t going to get it back. On top of all that, in school I was getting quite a bit of shit for something I didn\u2019t do, and Ive just been feeling so upset. In school I\u2019d hide it and at home no-one has the ability to tell. Then I had a week holiday, for the most of which I\u2019ve just been so bored out of my mind and I\u2019ve just been feeling so down that I wondered how dopamine felt. I went through another week of school feeling even more down, and on Friday I passed out in school (completely unrelated to feeling down, or the lack of PS4 or anything like that). I was taken to hospital and it was in class, and I felt more embarrassed than I ever have in life. No amount of words could describe how awkward and embarrassed I felt. Ultimately I came home and luckily at least it was a Friday and I had the weekend, to do nothing and be bored out of my mind. \n\nNow it\u2019s Sunday, I feel like there\u2019s hundreds of chains of negative emotions on me, and I can\u2019t talk about it to my friends or family, I have no-one. Is this what depression feels like?",
          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a student in a public school, 14yr M. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m just feeling quite down due to recent events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lemme give ya\u2019ll a backstory. For most of my life I\u2019ve just been coming home from school to play video games. All my life, I\u2019ve needed some sort of motivation or something to get out of bed in the morning, push through the day, get through all of my school work, etc. That motivation. For me was video games. Whether it\u2019s just talking to my friend while messing about in Fifa or Cod, or being really excited to play through really engaging and beautifully created narratives in games like RDR2 and The Last Of Us. I know this sound kinda weird or something but yeah that\u2019s basically my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After an argument with my Dad he took away my PlayStation. He\u2019s done this quite a few times in the past and he\u2019s really stubborn and arrogant and he really pisses me of because he will never understand me or even try to. Honestly the only good thing I can say about him is that he pays the bills, he goes to work sometimes, and he very rarely tries to care about me or even acknowledges my existence. This never really affected my siblings and my family isn\u2019t the type that talks about feelings, hence my hesitation towards writing this. I never really talk about my feelings and I always bottle them up, and release them in video games, instead of smashing my house down when I\u2019m feeling angry, I can just turn on God Of War and activate the rage mode and just smash all the enemies into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to recap I play games to:\nA: To get through the day\nB: To have fun or to be captivated in their enticing stories\nC: To release all my negative emotions &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Games like God Of War, RDR2, TLOU, etc are really good at getting A,B and C, so I play them a lot. My parents however believe I\u2019m addicted as if were cocaine or something and believe that it\u2019s just a distraction, which is something that I understand why they think that but for me, its so much more than that, its a coping mechanism to their bad parenting. They rarely acknowledge or recognise when I\u2019m going through a bad day and need some support. I just wish I had better parents who understood me and whom I could talk to about this. When I try to initiate a conversation with my Dad he often shuts it down and he argues with me over the littlest things. I can work my ass of and try very hard in school and when a test that I did reflects my hard work, I\u2019m given very little reward for doing it and my Dad just thinks I should be doing it anyway and he doesn\u2019t really care tbh. And then on the other side I can do something remotely bad and I\u2019m met with shouting and lecturing and this really pisses me of so when I play PS4, he thinks that I\u2019m gaining all this rage from it, when in reality its the opposite way round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know so many people who put in less than half the effort than I do, and their parents reward them so much more than mine, as they understand how hard our tests are. My father who\u2019s tests were very easy, still failed a lot of them and he has very little appreciation for my hard work and if I get a few marks of, he has the audacity to complain why I didn\u2019t get full marks. I don\u2019t really say much to him as if I did I\u2019d know that I\u2019d get in a very deep conversation with him and he wouldn\u2019t understand and he\u2019d just take it as an insult. I\u2019m not asking for a Lamborghini every time I do good in a test, I\u2019m just asking for appreciation and motivation here and there, and if I\u2019m lucky maybe even a gift every year or so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In school I hang around with about like 20 \u2018Friends\u2019. Only about 4-5 of them are real close friend who I often talk to and joke around with. They are good people and I really respect them for understanding me. For the other 15 or so \u2018Friends\u2019 they aren\u2019t really friends as they are people who just make fun of me, they\u2019re not really bullies, they do make fun of me but they just believe its a joke. I get mocked quite a bit in school, I\u2019m not the strongest nor the tallest so they think I\u2019m just an easy target. This never really affected me as I\u2019d just counteract the negative emotions with playing on the PS4 and joking around with my close friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I got in an argument with my Dad, and long story short he really pissed me of and I said some deep stuff which he took as an insult, and took away my PS4.

In that time I haven\u2019t been able to do much due to being restricted to movement,mobility and pain. So basically I been stuck at home most the time in my room not being able to go out,socialise and do everyday things. This is when it all started. \nI started getting fluttering in my chest,palpitations,throat swelling like it\u2019s was closing up like it was cutting my air off while I was sleeping, then came the even scarier part, I\u2019d be either falling asleep or already asleep and get a big thump, shortness of breath,\nnumbness, pins and needles in my arm that would radiate up my neck and jaw and constant feeling of pressure on my chest.\nAt this point I though I was having a heart attack. Most of these symptoms would happen almost every night some time multiple times.\nI seen many drs did multiple blood work including ones that test if you have had a heart attack or blood clots, everything came back fine..  \n\nso I have my surgery stuck in a foot cast for several weeks restricted to my 4 walls and a bunch of pain killers. In this time you tend to have allot of time on your hands and do a lot of thinking, this is where I start thinking what am I going to do with my life I can\u2019t go back to work (my ankles fu*ked my backs fuc#ked is what I\u2019m thinking ) my life\u2019s on hold I\u2019m going backwards I can\u2019t sleep I\u2019m stressed,and scared to sleep because of these symptoms, thinking I\u2019m not going to wake up that if I fall asleep I\u2019m going to die. \n\nEventually I get put in a moon boot. This means I can walk around get out of the house until BOOM these symptoms start while I\u2019m out . \nNausea, fluttering, palpitations my vision would get blurry I\u2019d find it hard to concentrate, brain fog even bit of vertigo from time to time. I couldn\u2019t be around people or crowds I\u2019d have to get out of there, my friends and family would notice somethings wrong and ask are you ok and then it would get worse thinking everyone is staring at me thinking something is wrong or I don\u2019t look well and I\u2019d get paranoid of this and cause even more anxiety /panic attacks , I\u2019d constantly be tired and struggle to get out of bed and no matter how much sleep I\u2019d get I\u2019d be nodding off and always fatigued. \n\nSeveral months later I start getting my life back after a lot of phisio therapy and rehabilitation, my symptoms are all here still but not as intense. I  have recently had another minor operation and now have decided to speak to someone about all this that is going.\n\n1 and a half years later I decide this .WHY?????\nWell I wasn\u2019t convinced it was anxiety and/or depression even when the g.p said it could be. I was to proud I guess to say I\u2019m depressed or suffer anxiety, I didn\u2019t want to admit it or think that I did, worried what people will think of me, I just didn\u2019t want to think about it at all\n \nSo I decided to see a psychiatrist and get my life  back. I\u2019ve always been sceptical on anti depressants that they are going to turn you into a zombie and make you worse than what you where, I\u2019ve decided to take her advice and start medication Valdoxan. \n\nLong story I know but Moral of it is don\u2019t be like me and shrug it off and in denial and let it destroy your life . Speak to someone and get the help and advice you need .\n\n             Remember \nIT AINT WEAK TO SPEAK.",

I\u2019ve been suffering from feelings of mysterious and extreme physical fatigue for years now. Doctors ordered a blood test and found that it could be a possible autoimmune disease. He then sent me to a specialist but even after describing all my symptoms and how it is impacting my life the specialist didn\u2019t take me seriously and just chalked it down to \u2018stress\u2019.

No diagnosis and therefore no medication to improve this quality of life I\u2019m in. Now fast forward to now I\u2019ve been hit with another mysterious illness, one involving chronic brain fog and dizziness to the point where I can\u2019t walk properly or concentrate and often lose my balance. I\u2019ve had times where I was literally going to pass out while at the mall. Again back to the doctors and again still unable to get a proper diagnosis or treatment. At first they thought it could be migraines but after a few tests and looking at the symptoms wasn\u2019t likely the case. I used to have so many dreams and goals in my life but feel like they\u2019ve all been destroyed because my body keeps literally fucking up every second. I feel like a human pancake everyday lying in bed all day unable to do anything and function like a normal healthy person. On top of that my best and only true friend died due to a sudden illness at the start of this year. I literally have nothing anymore, had to drop out of school due to the range of illnesses and grief. \nPeople say they lose everything but at least they still have their health, well I don\u2019t even have that right now. I\u2019m so sick of this. I know other people have far worse diseases but I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m feeling like absolute shit and totally hopeless with my life right now.
