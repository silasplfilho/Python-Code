Didn\u2019t last long. I was completely surprised when I was told I was being let go, and told I was a nice guy but just \u201cstruggling\u201d with the job. This was a complete shock to me.\n\nI had a few seasonal jobs after. I now have a job I\u2019ve had for a little over a year. Even this job I almost lost. But instead, I was allowed to be transferred to a different area. But what I do is predominately done by teenagers and special needs people. I\u2019ve mostly stopped caring about people\u2019s negative opinions about me, but to say I don\u2019t care AT ALL would be untrue. And I certainly don\u2019t think well of myself.\n\nSchool was awful, everyone bullied me, some girls even pretended to like me as a joke for all of their friends to laugh at me, I\u2019ve also been called ugly by a lot of girls online more recently (so this hasn\u2019t been limited only to school) and due to being so sheltered and isolated I\u2019ve been taken advantage of by some people.\n\nI sometimes get really angry, probably because I never did growing up. I\u2019ll literally feel like I could pick up a knife or a gun (if I had access) and kill somebody sometimes. So, I went to a psychiatrist to get some new meds, which he simply added to what I already take (for OCD that used to be WAAAAAY worse but still exists enough to where it\u2019s not life-stopping but pretty annoying, my insecurity and trauma has been life-stopping though).\n\nI don\u2019t go to therapy on a regular basis (my mom took me one time after I told her how I really feel when I get mad and blow up) but never tried to get me to go again.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I gone myself? I can\u2019t drive. This is actually something I\u2019m improving on though, which seems to be almost a requirement to even have a chance at getting an independent and decently enjoyable life. Fear of driving is what kept me inside for years (rural area and parents wouldn\u2019t drive me into town, live in urban now and now they\u2019re willing to drive me, and also there is Uber and Lyft service which I take to fill in the gaps when I can\u2019t get a ride).\n\nSo why don\u2019t I just take Uber to therapy once a month while I still have health insurance for two more years (I\u2019m almost 24 and you get kicked off your parents health insurance at 26 in the US)? Shame. In fact, (besides insecurity of not driving and making low wage at a bottom level job) I feel to paralyzed to really do ANYTHING while I live with my parents. \n\nMy dad always criticized me for everything. He\u2019s stopped drinking, and lives 50 miles away, but he still kind of has a hard attitude (for more context, he LOVES our President, like he thinks he\u2019s the best America has had).\n\nMy dad is actually the only person I can usually drive with (every couple of weeks). An actual driving instructor ripped me off, my mom\u2019s too scared, and my step dad is gone most of the week for work (he\u2019s also been extremely abusive often, but even when he\u2019s not, he\u2019s not here the entire week anyway).\n\nNobody pushes me to do anything, and for the longest time I didn\u2019t care enough to even try to make myself do anything, and even now I have a lot of doubts.\n\nI registered for community college, plan on going a couple of days taking an Uber (which my parents have tried to discourage saying just do classes ONLY online) and a couple of days online. Not just to save on Uber, but also to not lose too many work hours. Also, to try and see if I can possibly break into a social life? Maybe it\u2019ll be better in community college in a city than high school was in a small town?\n\nI\u2019m a virgin and never had a girlfriend. Maybe that shouldn\u2019t be my priority now, but I feel like I missed that train when it was supposed to happen, and that I may have missed out for good now. \n\nI don\u2019t want to end up a 40, or even 30 year old virgin who\u2019s never even had a girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want to reach 25 that way (because I read sex feels less good for males and you suffer permanent mental damage if you\u2019ve never experienced a relationship/love/intimacy) but since I\u2019m almost 24 I may not make it by then.\n\nI haven\u2019t been to school since high school, which I barely made it through, but I also wasn\u2019t putting in much effort, and now I know how important it really is.\n\nI hate the incel community, they\u2019re just toxic and hurtful and not helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to feel up to working tirelessly and hard effort when you feel it\u2019s pointless and hopeless because you won\u2019t reap any rewards and still be stuck.\n\nLife is one big competition, who wants to compete just for basic survival and a decent life? The fierce competition for basic survival and basic life is ridiculous.\n\nThe boomers had it easier, they could get factory jobs right out of high school. And (obviously unknowing to them) everything is much different now, more competitive, for digital and technology based, more complicated and requiring more complex thinking and comprehension.\n\nI was looking at trying to get a degree in graphic design. Now I\u2019m unsure (haven\u2019t even started community college yet) because a graphic designer just told me that while he gets to work from home, he doesn\u2019t make a lot because so many people do it. Competition is good for athletes and businesses, but bad for the average population, being average isn\u2019t good enough anymore, but everyone can\u2019t be the best, it is naturally impossible.\n\nPublic school was, and is now EVEN MORE, A JOKE. And I\u2019ve read that college can even be a joke. \n\nBut, I\u2019m definitely not making any progress towards starting life just working a shitty job and living with my parents. I\u2019m too old to continue just \u201cTake gap years, do nothing until you figure it out.\u201d That hasn\u2019t been beneficial to me AT ALL these past 6 years, so fuck that shit. I have to do SOMETHING.\n\nI don\u2019t care if I end up drowning in student loan debt, being debt free is worthless when you\u2019re not qualified for any good jobs.\n\nI\u2019d also like the option of getting out of this country, as the US is so low on morals and anti-progressive (you can\u2019t even legally buy sex outside of one region of one state) and I read that people are generally nicer, women kinder and desire nice respectful men, in other countries. \n\nSome of these countries are much less developed, like islands/villages in the east, but of this means less stressful (including WAY cheaper) then that could potentially be great!\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have it in me to compete for \u201cTHE AMERICAN DREAM\u201d in modern USA, I\u2019m too beaten down and MOSTLY given up, it all feels so pointless and hopeless......",

I was getting so fed up of having  people not listen to me on Halloween night 2 years ago I tried to commit suicide, I drank cough syrup and got ready to drive to my grandfather\u2019s grave and take all my sleeping pills.

         "selftext": "1. Your loved ones are alive and well in the afterlife\n\nYes, it's true that our physical bodies do expire/die. But our souls are eternal. Your deceased loved ones are very much alive and on the other side \u2013 heaven, if you will.\n\nYou cannot die no matter how hard you try. Once you leave this body that we are born into, we return to heaven to meet up with our loved ones in the afterlife who have gone before us.\n\nOver the past 30 years, I've literally brought back tens of thousands of specific, explicit messages from deceased loved ones. There's simply too much proof that they exist on the other side to deny it.\n\nLove never dies.\n\n2. Your loved ones are NOT in pain\n\nOne of biggest hurdles that people struggle with is the last memory we have of our loved ones. Especially those who have suffered greatly with a terrible disease.\n\nI have good news for you. Once you leave your body, you are no longer in any pain.\n\nUnfortunately, we tend to remember how our loved ones died, rather than how they lived.\n\nYour deceased loved ones \u2013 if they suffered \u2013 are no longer in pain.\n\nHere's a humorous example from a recent live event: I brought through a Dad who immediately showed me he was doing a funny dance. The young lady burst into tears saying it couldn't be him, his legs were amputated!\n\nBut here's the thing: his physical legs were amputated, yes. And he suffered before passing. But on the other side, we are returned back to the \u201cimage of God\u201d and restored.\n\nDad was dancing to show his daughter he was alive and well in the afterlife. Hilariously, she admitted that when he was well, he danced silly at her wedding and it was a memory she'll always remember.\n\nSee? It's the happy memories they want us to remember!\n\n3. Your loved ones don't miss you!\n\nThis often shocks people. Your deceased loved ones DO NOT miss you.\n\nHow can they? They aren't \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nYour deceased loved ones are very much alive in spirit.\n\nThey are still loving and very interested in the goings-on of your life.\n\nYes, my friend, they are very much alive. They can see and hear you and they know what is going on in your life. They don't miss you because\u2026 they are still here, just in spirit.\n\nHow much can they see? Well\u2026\n\n4. They see everything in the afterlife! Everything\u2026\n\nI'm often asked, \u201cHey Blair, do they see\u2026 everything?\u201d\n\nBad news: yes, they see EVERYTHING. Yes, they can see you naked in the shower.\n\nOne lady told me that after her Mother had passed she refused to have sex with her husband because she didn't want her Mom to see! (I'm not joking).\n\nYes, they can see everything. However, they are free from their bodies and very much evolved and enlightened. They no longer care about the material or the physical in that specific way.\n\nPlease, have showers and take baths. Your deceased loved ones don't care, and your friends and family will appreciate it.\n\n5. They can hear you in the afterlife\n\nThis is a BIG ONE. As a medium, I'm often asked a variation of \u201cPlease tell my ______ I love her.\u201d\n\nYou don't need a medium to do so. Your deceased loved ones can hear you perfectly fine. I repeat you do not need a medium to talk to them.\n\nI'd highly recommend trying out my T.A.L.K. method from my book Afterlife. It works well.\n\n6. They are sending you signs and want to connect with you.\n\nHere's a comment I get a lot: \u201cMy ______ never sends me signs.\u201d\n\nI'm sure that people are sincere and believe that when they say it. But it is absolutely not true. Not at all.\n\nYour deceased loved ones send you signs on a regular basis. No, not every single day, but often enough to encourage us.\n\nSo, the problem isn't with the signs. The problem is RECOGNIZING them.\n\nIn some ways, it's like a language. If you don't know the meanings of the words, how will you understand what they are saying?\n\nThankfully, recognizing the signs is easy: you need to know what the five signs are and you need to be open to experiencing them.\n\n7. You won't burn in hell for experiencing love.\n\nUnfortunately, religious dogma has messed up a lot of people and guilted them into believing that connecting with deceased loved ones is evil. Or that you'll burn in hell if you do speak with them.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. In the Holy Bible, Jesus spoke with both Moses and Elijah who were deceased at the time. If Jesus could talk to the dead with his Father's blessing, it certainly is okay for you to as well.\n\nThe confusion comes from religions and religious texts being man-made. They are filled with conflicts and errors.\n\nOf course, you are welcome to believe what you wish. By all means, live the rest of your days sad and lonely. It's certainly a choice, but it is not of God. And honestly, I feel sorry for people guilted by this flawed dogma. I hope and pray you are not one of them.\n\nI hope this helps you. Love and light to you.",

If you don&amp;#39;t know the meanings of the words, how will you understand what they are saying?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, recognizing the signs is easy: you need to know what the five signs are and you need to be open to experiencing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You won&amp;#39;t burn in hell for experiencing love.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, religious dogma has messed up a lot of people and guilted them into believing that connecting with deceased loved ones is evil. Or that you&amp;#39;ll burn in hell if you do speak with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing could be further from the truth. In the Holy Bible, Jesus spoke with both Moses and Elijah who were deceased at the time. If Jesus could talk to the dead with his Father&amp;#39;s blessing, it certainly is okay for you to as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The confusion comes from religions and religious texts being man-made. They are filled with conflicts and errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, you are welcome to believe what you wish. By all means, live the rest of your days sad and lonely. It&amp;#39;s certainly a choice, but it is not of God. And honestly, I feel sorry for people guilted by this flawed dogma. I hope and pray you are not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you. Love and light to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s impacted my ability to put on a face in my videos, to edit videos and get them up on time, and I think has to do with the rush and excitement of being popular on YouTube, followed by the slow downfall of my channel as a result of YouTube\u2019s constantly changing algorithm that is always suggesting new content for the viewer. As a content creator, there\u2019s nothing more destructive to your emotional state than making a video that should have gotten more attention, just to have YouTube\u2019s algorithm not recommend or notify your subscribers when you upload anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts, but my doctor recommended one of those lights you\u2019re supposed to use daily but it never did anything for me. I feel very isolated in my life because anything I do or say around people who are even close to me will find it\u2019s way around around to the internet. I\u2019ve had my loved ones harassed both online and in public, which has led me to question if I want to be on YouTube at all, but it\u2019s what I feel I was born to do and I can\u2019t see myself doing anything else.\n\nI guess I just wanted to make an anonymous post because I feel isolated and can\u2019t confide in anyone due to being pushed away for my feelings since I\u2019ve lost many friends and loved ones in recent years and have been manipulated by family which has made me lose trust in them. Every day is a struggle and I feel like depression is a monster that is going to kill me when it catches me, and I can only run from it for so long. I\u2019ve been exercising, eating better, and focusing on the positives in my life but I just can\u2019t shake the monster.

I'm making 20% more but still seem to always be overdrafting and living paycheck to paycheck because I suck so much at budgeting and managing my money. I can't even afford to take advantage of my company's FMLA leave to get some help mentally because its half pay and I'm struggle bussing hard on my full paycheck.\n\nSince my wife and I married I've very much damaged our relationship in several very serious ways. Like I'm shocked she will even still speak to me, let alone stay with me. What I've done is the single biggest reason I hate myself, and my younger self would be absolutely disgusted and horrified by who I am and what I've done.\n\nNone of my friends from childhood, HS, or college keep in contact.

I don't feel suicidal, mostly because if I did kill myself my wife and daughter would be up shit creek, since I don't think any life insurance gets paid in suicides.

I don't need or dream of a massive house, 4 cars, or anything extravagant - just a home in good repair, a car each to get to work/appointments/around, and enough money to pay the bills, save for retirement, and still have a bit of fun occasionally.\n\nI feel like I'm a worthless, hopeless, unlovable monster.

When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, \u201cyou can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.\u201d I lied to the police, told them I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.\n\nIve kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that \u2018there was nothing we could do.\u2019 and \\*\\*\u2018there will be no more family if you keep up with this.\u2019\\*\\*\n\nMy brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He\u2019s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.\n\nWhenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, \u2018Tell your therapist that, not us.\u2019\n\nIn my Mom and I\u2019s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of \u2018why didn\u2019t you tell me it was happening? why didn\u2019t you tell me one time?\u2019 And then followed that up with, \u2018When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.\u2019\n\nI have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn\u2019t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He\u2019s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to \u2018Not make a scene.\u2019\n\nI need some sort of grounding because I\u2019ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.\n\nThe biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn\u2019t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.",

When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, \u201cyou can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.\u201d I lied to the police, told them I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that \u2018there was nothing we could do.\u2019 and **\u2018there will be no more family if you keep up with this.\u2019**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He\u2019s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, \u2018Tell your therapist that, not us.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my Mom and I\u2019s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of \u2018why didn\u2019t you tell me it was happening? why didn\u2019t you tell me one time?\u2019 And then followed that up with, \u2018When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn\u2019t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He\u2019s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to \u2018Not make a scene.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need some sort of grounding because I\u2019ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn\u2019t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Aside from having an ex commit suicide because his white ex-girlfriend wouldn't take him back after he dumped me on the grounds that he \"couldn't see himself with someone like me\"; everything else has been just peachy. I felt guilty about not being able to be there for him and it manifested into me developing this savior complex and becoming a super-teacher for 5 years. I just stepped away from that because I was constantly sexually harassed at work and people always talked about race around me - awkward.  On top of that I had to sit there and watch my best friend deal with cancer for three years. He died last month - on my birthday - the same day I quit teaching. I would laugh, but the irony only kills me deeper inside. Did I mention that I went on a date with a guy I met through a dating app a year ago and was raped - oh yeah, it keeps getting better. As I sit in a cafe and ignore some random black dude talking loudly in my direction as he is on a date with his beautiful snow queen to let her know how different he is from \"other black men\" and how he doesn't date black women because we \"all have attitude problems\"; I can't help but wonder if this is it. Will my life always be this depressing? Now, I'm working part-time jobs where I make enough to pay rent but I'm back at home with my parents to take a break and \"heal\" - or whatever the fuck that means. Does it work? Do stupid deep inhalations make you feel better when you think so much that your head is about to explode? Yes, but why do I want to not explode? What is the point really in carrying on with a shitty life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look around and have an amazing idea that could save the lives of millions of struggling children who feel worthless academically because they learn differently. I work on that idea every day but I question it. Why give a fuck about a world that obviously made its mind up about me in such an inconceivably evil way? If you had the ability to save someone who shat all over you, rubbed it in, stepped backed and laughed about it while encouraging others to do the same - would you?? Would you fucking do it? IDK anymore. Every night before I go to sleep I beg God to kill me in my sleep while I'm dreaming because my dreams are the best parts of my life. I dream of dying in my sleep and not being given this choice. This huge choice that requires a level of forgiveness that I'm not willing to learn just yet. I don't want to forgive because it means admitting that my pride, my ego and my self conceit are the real issue - not them, not, the world. So, I'm waiting for something - the guts to die or the guts to forgive and create something worthy of a medal. Ha - Where is the skull that I can palm while I shout a useless diatribe towards the heavens? Ugh, I'm ready for your hateful comments.",

In terms of my physical body, I feel like a 14 year old even though I'm 19. If I follow my siblings' pattern, I should be taller than my older brother now, but I'm not.

But what I really feel is that my personality is developing and changing slower than it should. I still get nervous about the smallest things, like asking around for help or info from strangers.

I would just tell myself I was worthless and not good enough. I started smoking weed junior year, not a lot. I rarely ever did it because I felt like I needed my \u201cbrain cells\u201d for the SATs and for my hard classes. and I knew that senior year was just bs. So once junior year ended I started smoking with my friends. At the beginning of summer, I had only kissed one guy - My best guy friend, no feelings for sure. We were both drunk when it happened and we typically make out when we\u2019re drunk. He\u2019s gay hah so it really meant nothing. The first week of summer I kissed two other guys and gave them head. It hit me hard for some reason, I was just shocked at myself since that\u2019s the farthest I\u2019ve ever gone and it was with people I wasn\u2019t even \u201ctalking to\u201d or trying to pursue. I was drunk and it was an in the moment thing. Summer was a lot of fun at first, I wasn\u2019t sad. I was working out for soccer and just enjoying my summer with friends. As school rolled around I didn\u2019t really slow down smoking, if anything I started smoking more. I smoked alone for the first time and I start to get sad while I was high. I\u2019m a straight A student, but I got a B in ap world and ap calc junior year. And then senior year I know I\u2019m getting a B in ap comparative government and a B in college level statistics. My grades kinda slipped for the standards I set myself. Last night I had sex with one of the guys I gave head to. I was completely sober and he was high, and he had no feelings for me and I had no feelings for him. He just wanted sex. I don\u2019t know why I did it. I\u2019ve always told myself I wanted my first time to be with someone who I had feelings for and they had feelings for me too. And I just did this in the moment. I currently wish I waited, but at the same I don\u2019t think it was that big of a deal. Sex is sex and it\u2019s too hyped up. However, I did feel nothing. Like I actually felt no pleasure, it didn\u2019t hurt. It was just uncomfortable. It literally just felt like a penis was in my vagina lmao. Meaningless sex felt meaningless and like nothing. I guess I did it because I didn\u2019t want to turn 18 a virgin, or go to beach week after graduation not having had sex. I obviously would\u2019ve rather had sex with someone I cared about but typically when I have feelings for a guy, they don\u2019t reciprocate. \nI\u2019m just mad at myself because I used to care so much about school and I still do, I still get my shit done I just half ass everything and I\u2019m getting Bs in classes I know I can get an A in if I just tried a little harder. And I\u2019m mad at myself I think of myself so lowly to have sex with someone who means nothing to me. \nEveryone around me is getting better grades, smoking just as much as me. Everyone is pursuing a person that is reciprocating their feelings and everyone just seems ready for life. While I\u2019m making mine a shithole. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking for from posting this, I think I just need some input or advice in general... in life in general.",

But now my appetite has vanished, managing a small amount of something a day, not sleeping much 2 to 5 hours a night, im currently exhausted even though its the middle of the day and i have work again in half an hour. I have zero interest in anything, i watch anime but find it hard to watch one episode before i lose concentration on it, i usually play video games but other than a couple phone games and the new Pok\u00e9mon game I've barely touched any and it used to be my go to thing to escape reality.\nI'm on an antidepressant have been for a few months, but quite clearly isn't working at all. Meant to be going for my first CBT session next month and im shitting myself over it. I need to re-order my tablets but i usually do it via an app, but my apps logged me out and I don't remember my login. I can go to the doctors to request it but that idea is terrifying me enough to just not bother even if i get withdrawal from stopping them suddenly.\nWorks too much but i need to be at work to keep my mind off things otherwise i dwell in my thoughts way too much.

Every tiny thing is just too much, so much house work needs doing and i can't, i get home from work and im just wiped out.\nI'm not even sure how i feel half the time, its like i know im not ok but I can't put it into words, its like my emotions are haywire and sometimes theres just no emotion at all.

He's a foreigner, an aggressive one, aggressive to the point where he used to beat us kids even without being on any substance. You can't talk to the man, you can't counter-argue his statements. He turns everything he does on to others, and he none-stop berates and verbally assaults me and 1 other. He used to my other siblings but they've moved out, and my little sister is the favorite.\n\nI've tried getting close to my father multiple times in the past 6 months, first I bought him a $120 scope for the rifle he's never shot. Then, I bought him a waterpump kit for a boat he never uses, roughly $90 with shipping. My last purchase was on his birthday, everyone else just threw $40 at him after we agreed to pitch in and get him something decent. Well, it didn't happen the way I expected, so I not only gave him $40, I bought him a $150 metal detector..\n\nAfter I give him something, he usually stays off my case for a while. It's not even been 2 weeks, he's already none-stop bitching at me and has tried to get me aggressive like I would when I tapered off my antidepressant.

He&amp;#39;s a foreigner, an aggressive one, aggressive to the point where he used to beat us kids even without being on any substance. You can&amp;#39;t talk to the man, you can&amp;#39;t counter-argue his statements. He turns everything he does on to others, and he none-stop berates and verbally assaults me and 1 other. He used to my other siblings but they&amp;#39;ve moved out, and my little sister is the favorite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried getting close to my father multiple times in the past 6 months, first I bought him a $120 scope for the rifle he&amp;#39;s never shot. Then, I bought him a waterpump kit for a boat he never uses, roughly $90 with shipping. My last purchase was on his birthday, everyone else just threw $40 at him after we agreed to pitch in and get him something decent. Well, it didn&amp;#39;t happen the way I expected, so I not only gave him $40, I bought him a $150 metal detector..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I give him something, he usually stays off my case for a while. It&amp;#39;s not even been 2 weeks, he&amp;#39;s already none-stop bitching at me and has tried to get me aggressive like I would when I tapered off my antidepressant.

         "selftext": "Hi everyone. My name's Sofia, I'm 23. I was recently diagnosed with OCD and I'm taking anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs now (doing so much better), but for all my life I had serious mental problems. Luckily, I can often hide them from others and most people I know think I'm \"normal\". I have a boyfriend, I work as trainee lawyer, I have friends... Etc.\n\nThis might sound silly, but... I have a question regarding my mental meltdowns, what they are specifically and if anyone else has the same problem.\n\nSince I was 12 I have a symptom that I find really weird. When I get overwhelmed by some situation, usually a serious argument with certain people when I'm not feeling well, sometimes, I start feeling like there's a fire growing inside of me.

At some point, if the trigger is still present, I meltdown. I completely lose control of my behavior and there's literally nothing I can do to control myself.

It's something MUCH worse.\n\nI start screaming and I sit on the floor doing repeated movements and usually I scratch myself or hit myself.

I was recently diagnosed with OCD and I&amp;#39;m taking anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs now (doing so much better), but for all my life I had serious mental problems. Luckily, I can often hide them from others and most people I know think I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. I have a boyfriend, I work as trainee lawyer, I have friends... Etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might sound silly, but... I have a question regarding my mental meltdowns, what they are specifically and if anyone else has the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was 12 I have a symptom that I find really weird. When I get overwhelmed by some situation, usually a serious argument with certain people when I&amp;#39;m not feeling well, sometimes, I start feeling like there&amp;#39;s a fire growing inside of me. It&amp;#39;s the worst feeling in world and I don&amp;#39;t even know what to call it. I start giving signs like crying in a weird way, shaking, saying bad things to myself, repeating some movements.

         "selftext": "A little backstory so yall understand my situation. Tl:dr at bottom. \n\nAbout 4 years ago I had a heart attack out of nowhere. I wqs super active and wqs always outdoors hiking, swimming, playing paintball playing DDR, so not lethargic and lazy. The dr said that it was nothing i couldve done to my self. Life dealt me a bad hand. My heart valves are about 20% smaller than they need to be. I understand that life sucks and bad things happen to good people so I wasnt upset. Started taking the meds, but they didnt help, I steadily got worse. I had a pacemaker put in because my dr thought I would die at any moment. Again, I was fine, im part robot now. \n\nNot too long after this though, my wife started to be constantly upset with me and was always angry because as I got worse, I wqsnt able to function as normally as I shouldve been. Look up end stage heart failure for reference. Around November 16, my wife pulled the old cigarette move on me. She went to go get cat litter, took our daughter and went to her friends and stayed there. She wouldnt talk to me, answer phone calls or txts. Just up and left. I wqs able to still see my kid due to a mutual friend. My wife finally talked to me about 2 weeks later and said she was overwhelmed and hated how our life had become, along with some lies that she was being fed by the friend she ran to, so she ran away. We worked things out of the course of the next few weeks. \n\nFast forward to October 2017, Friday the 13th to be exact. \n\nI die. \n\nLuckily my pacemaker kicked in and I came back. Things took a drastic turn for the worse after that. My heart stopped again in November, then again in December. This time though, the pacemaker didnt work. I was dead for over 10 mins. I suffered a stroke and was on life support for 6 days. I get transferred to the hospital where my dr was, only to find out by a new nurse of hers, that on out very first meeting, she said I wasnt worth the effort, and should would just do her best to placate me. Furious, I left the hospital and went to seek out another dr. Over the next few months, My heart give out 3 more times. I finally end up getting heart surgery August of 2018. Silver lining- now im a battery powered robot. \n\nI still have a hard time with life due to the excess baggage of my heart device I have to carry, and my inability to do alot of things I found fun due to my team of drs not wanting me to. I have to he under constant supervision incase theres an issue, someone rlse has to monitor the device, not me. My wife is the one who does it. \n\nNow my depression is really getting to me. I was forced back to work against dr orders, so theres that. Then Ive been getting migraines so bad that I cant see straight or get out of bed at times. My wife constantly chastises me for not being able to work and constantly belittles me because she says \u201cone of us has to work\u201d making me feel even worse about my situation. I try to tell her how she makes me feel, and she either ignores it, or tells me to stop complaining and deal with it. She hasnt been intimate with me in a few years, and im not talking about just sex, I mean cuddleing, going out and having some kind of romantic dinner. She just wants to sit and watch tv, and calls it quality time together. She says her lack of intimacy is due to her not liking herself, she is overweight, but refuses to do anything about it. I do things to show her shes fine the way she is to me, but rejects me and calls me stupid for feeling that way. \n\nI feel so overwhelmed by my situation, that I feel like imma die again because of it. \n\n&lt;b&gt;TL:DR&lt;\\b&gt;\n\nMy poker hand of life sucks, the people around me resent me for it, and its too much at times. \n\nWhat are some tips and techniques yall have/use to not feel shitty all the time. I do see a therapist and a psycologist, but just tell me to take pills and itll make things better. Pills dont help, I have an immunity to most drugs due to my mom being a heavy drinker and drug addict when i was being incubated. \n\nSo any help/advice is much appreciated. \n\nAlso, if you feel like the best advice you have is to say \u2018go kill yourself\u2019 or anything like that, please do not hesitate to say it. Im not going to take that advice, but if it makes you feel better, glad I could help.\n\n*Edit* geezus thats a wall of txt. Sorry...",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little backstory so yall understand my situation. Tl:dr at bottom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 4 years ago I had a heart attack out of nowhere. I wqs super active and wqs always outdoors hiking, swimming, playing paintball playing DDR, so not lethargic and lazy. The dr said that it was nothing i couldve done to my self. Life dealt me a bad hand. My heart valves are about 20% smaller than they need to be. I understand that life sucks and bad things happen to good people so I wasnt upset. Started taking the meds, but they didnt help, I steadily got worse. I had a pacemaker put in because my dr thought I would die at any moment. Again, I was fine, im part robot now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not too long after this though, my wife started to be constantly upset with me and was always angry because as I got worse, I wqsnt able to function as normally as I shouldve been. Look up end stage heart failure for reference. Around November 16, my wife pulled the old cigarette move on me. She went to go get cat litter, took our daughter and went to her friends and stayed there. She wouldnt talk to me, answer phone calls or txts. Just up and left. I wqs able to still see my kid due to a mutual friend. My wife finally talked to me about 2 weeks later and said she was overwhelmed and hated how our life had become, along with some lies that she was being fed by the friend she ran to, so she ran away.

lived in sweden.I say family,but by that I mean me and my mom.I\u2019m the oldest child so at that time it was just me.My dad didn\u2019t live with us because he was still in university.My mom was as well,but she was studying psychology in Sweden .Those days were probably the happiest in my life.I was carefree,and had lots of friends there.Then my dad convinced my mom to move back to my hometown.He was supposed to meet us there but decided to stay in his university instead to finish his bachelors or something.Me and my mom lived in my grandparents house for 2 years.(I feel like saying this makes it sound like I\u2019m flexing but I\u2019m really not)My grandparents own a school,which quite surprisingly pays quite well,so they live in a really big house.Me and my mom got the upstairs,and my grandparents had the downstairs.My dad came back and even though he promised he would buy us a house to live in so that we wouldn\u2019t have to live there,he didn\u2019t for a year.Then,we moved to England,and my grandparents rented us an apartment.I was bullied there because I was from Pakistan.I never had any friends,even though I tried as hard as I could.Its not like there was a language barrier or anything.English had always been my first language and Swedish was my second language.To this day I still have trouble understanding Urdu(Pakistan\u2019s language)Then,we moved back.My parents wanted me to get into a very prestigious school in the city where I live.I managed to get in,and thus began a new chapter in my life\n\n\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\nI remember my first day in that school.I got in in the 3rd grade and these two girls standing behind me in line kept making fun of me for my accent(I had a semi Swedish/British accent at the time from all my years spent abroad)I didn\u2019t really care about it though.I was always very shy,and didn\u2019t make many friends.I remember I would always read in the classroom during break,and would have multiple mental break downs everyday.I wasn\u2019t doing well in my classes either and in 3rd grade my life was already a mess.Then,I got to know the two girls who bullied me in grade 4.The three of us became best friends,and we were practically inseparable.We sat together in break,we went to each others houses after school.Then in the 6th grade,one of them moved away.Lets call them Ally and Sara,since those are like their real names.Ally was the one who moved away.Me and Sara went over to her house the day that she was leaving and we all started crying.Then,someone new came into t he mix.Lets call her Annie.I had never really been really good friends with her,but we started going to this after school class together,and became good friends.She also became friends with Sara and thus a new group was formed.In my school we have classes with the same set of people every year.Seventh grade was when they were switched so there would be new people in our class,and people who weren\u2019t in the school before.\nOn the first day of seventh grade me and Annie kept to ourselves.Sara was still on her summer vacation.When she came back,We met another girl,who I\u2019m gonna call  Danielle.We became best friends with her and everything was perfect for a while.Then,we got invited to this movie night with a couple of the guys in our class.It was at this guys house,and since he plays a somewhat important role in this story,we can call him Alex.Sara , immediately hit it off with him.He seemed nice enough but when I got to know him,he was this rude obnoxious character who was mean to everyone except for Sara.The two of us hated each other for the whole of seventh grade.I was very stand offish around everyone.Sara became friends with these boys who were in our old class,who we never really talked to,and became very close to them.In the summer before 8th grade,me and Sara visited the place where Ally had moved.We stayed with her and went out everyday.It was the happiest summer of my life.When we came back,her and Alex started dating.He asked her out and she said yes.Me and Alex got into a huge fight somewhere in the middle,which led to us practically screaming at each other,and me shooting him the finger and calling him a gay ass wimp.But after the fight,we both apologized,and became really close friends.At least I think we are.Hes still very rude to Danielle and Annie,and I have no real friends who aren\u2019t only friends with me because of safa.I know that they all prefer her

always abuses me and only cares about my grades,and when I get bad marks,he not only takes it out on me,but on my mom as well.I also know that my mom is cheating on my dad and I can see why.I wish that she would just leave him already.And to make matters worse,my exams are coming up and I know that I\u2019m screwed if I get bad marks again.",
         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\nWhen I was younger,my family lived in sweden.I say family,but by that I mean me and my mom.I\u2019m the oldest child so at that time it was just me.My dad didn\u2019t live with us because he was still in university.My mom was as well,but she was studying psychology in Sweden .Those days were probably the happiest in my life.I was carefree,and had lots of friends there.Then my dad convinced my mom to move back to my hometown.He was supposed to meet us there but decided to stay in his university instead to finish his bachelors or something.Me and my mom lived in my grandparents house for 2 years.(I feel like saying this makes it sound like I\u2019m flexing but I\u2019m really not)My grandparents own a school,which quite surprisingly pays quite well,so they live in a really big house.Me and my mom got the upstairs,and my grandparents had the downstairs.My dad came back and even though he promised he would buy us a house to live in so that we wouldn\u2019t have to live there,he didn\u2019t for a year.Then,we moved to England,and my grandparents rented us an apartment.I was bullied there because I was from Pakistan.I never had any friends,even though I tried as hard as I could.Its not like there was a language barrier or anything.English had always been my first language and Swedish was my second language.To this day I still have trouble understanding Urdu(Pakistan\u2019s language)Then,we moved back.My parents wanted me to get into a very prestigious school in the city where I live.I managed to get in,and thus began a new chapter in my life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\nI remember my first day in that school.I got in in the 3rd grade and these two girls standing behind me in line kept making fun of me for my accent(I had a semi Swedish/British accent at the time from all my years spent abroad)I didn\u2019t really care about it though.I was always very shy,and didn\u2019t make many friends.I remember I would always read in the classroom during break,and would have multiple mental break downs everyday.I wasn\u2019t doing well in my classes either and in 3rd grade my life was already a mess.Then,I got to know the two girls who bullied me in grade 4.The three of us became best friends,and we were practically inseparable.We sat together in break,we went to each others houses after school.Then in the 6th grade,one of them moved away.Lets call them Ally and Sara,since those are like their real names.Ally was the one who moved away.Me and Sara went over to her house the day that she was leaving and we all started crying.Then,someone new came into t he mix.Lets call her Annie.I had never really been really good friends with her,but we started going to this after school class together,and became good friends.She also became friends with Sara and thus a new group was formed.In my school we have classes with the same set of people every year.Seventh grade was when they were switched so there would be new people in our class,and people who weren\u2019t in the school before.\nOn the first day of seventh grade me and Annie kept to ourselves.Sara was still on her summer vacation.When she came back,We met another girl,who I\u2019m gonna call  Danielle.We became best friends with her and everything was perfect for a while.Then,we got invited to this movie night with a couple of the guys in our class.It was at this guys house,and since he plays a somewhat important role in this story,we can call him Alex.Sara , immediately hit it off with him.He seemed nice enough but when I got to know him,he was this rude obnoxious character who was mean to everyone except for Sara.The two of us hated each other for the whole of seventh grade.I was very stand offish around everyone.Sara became friends with these boys who were in our old class,who we never really talked to,and became very close to them.In the summer before 8th grade,me and Sara visited the place where Ally had moved.We stayed with her and went out everyday.It was the happiest summer of my life.When we came back,her and Alex started dating.He asked her out and she said yes.Me and Alex got into a huge fight somewhere in the middle,which led to us practically screaming at each other,and me shooting him the finger and calling him a gay ass wimp.But after the fight,we both apologized,and became really close friends.At least I think we are.Hes still very rude to Danielle and Annie,and I have no real friends who aren\u2019t only friends with me because of safa.I know that they all prefer her and I honestly don\u2019t know how to make them like me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\nAs you can

I always compare myself to other people, especially other girls, whom always seem to be prettier and to have a better life than me.\n\nSince I was little, my mom noticed I loved drawing, I always did. She's always been very supportive of my art, saying I was born to be an artist since I was a kid. This made me grow up believing art is the only thing I live for, the only thing I'm good at. My dad, on the other hand, never allowed me to attend art school so all I can do as an artist at the moment is self-taught.\n\nThis makes me sad because at 22 I am less than the person I was hoping to become. I regret many things from my past, especially letting my parents decide on my behalf for my own career and dating some toxic people. \n\nI believe I am a mediocre artist due to a lack of artistic education and my motivation to draw isn't that much anymore, especially after I made an Instagram and I started following other artists whom, in their 20's or 30's, make beautiful art with a well defined style and  unique personality.\n\nI believe I am a mediocre person. A decent person, a decent artist, an average looking girl.\n\nThere is nothing perky about me, I'm not stunningly beautiful, I don't have an unique personality and I don't make unique, creative or just top notch quality art.\n\nI hate being mediocre, I hate being just like anyone else, I hate it because I've always been told I would've gone far but I've just realized I won't...\n\nThis might sound trivial, I know, but I would really like to leave a mark on a large group of people by making content many people could appreciate. I want feedback, I want validation, I crave it.\n\nI currently work as an intern (paid, luckily) in a company that hasn't much to do with art, but since they hired me I've been feeling a little less useless. Still, this feeling of worthlessness hasn't completely left me and it sometimes comes back making me really depressed and sometimes suicidal.\n\nI also hate my looks and often avoid the mirror. I look gross in my own eyes.\n\nIdk what to do to build up more self-esteem, make time to draw and finish the comic I am working at, I want my mojo back, I want to stop comparing myself to others and feel bad about the person I am, I want to stop picking compulsively on my skin because I hate my face.",

I\u2019m worried about her bc not taking care of yourself physically is a clear sign that you\u2019re probably severely depressed. I want to help her, I always want to help motivate and encourage my friends through shit bc I feel like that\u2019s important to do for people you care about. And it\u2019s easier for me to give and listen to others than to worry about myself sometimes. I just don\u2019t want her to feel alone. \n\nI texted her again this morning and asked if I could bring her a coffee and just be in her nest with her and she could talk at me if she needs to before I go to work. I don\u2019t know if this is the right thing to do though, maybe I\u2019m going out of my way to be the exact thing she doesn\u2019t need. But I\u2019m really worried about her and worried if this wave doesn\u2019t pass her, she might resort to self-harm.\n\nI just need some advice. I want to help but I don\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable either. Maybe this is just a process for her in her depression, but it\u2019s day seven now and I\u2019m a little wigged out.

         "selftext": "A little back story. (And sorry ahead of time for my grammar and spelling) My first marriage started with my ex and I working together and ended up dating shortly after she was pregnant with my first child. And we started building a life together. We buy our first home for $13k and fix it up and in a couple years have baby #2 on the way. Sell that house for $32k and buy a much nicer home for $50k. We're moving up, building a life and a future. Our 3rd son is born while living in that house and I'm feeling pretty good about life. Got a decent union job (3rd shift), my ex about to graduate with a bachelor's. Everyone was taken care of.\u00a0\n\n\nThen one morning after coming home from work my wife tells my she's wanting to cheat. Fucking blindsided me. We talk and talk and I am absolutely terrified of the thought of losing my family. She talks about swinging and opening up our relationship. And I'm not a prude I've realistically thought about threesome and stuff like that so I reluctantly agree. A mistake. She wasn't honest at all through the whole thing. I was always invading her privacy if I wanted to\u00a0 know what was going on lied about what she was doing and who with. Would have guys over while I was working night shift and our kids were asleep upstairs. The stress was killing me fast. I lost 25-30lbs in like 3 weeks. Finally I had to leave.\u00a0\n\n\nI got off work one morning packed some stuff in my truck and had to say goodbye to my children. My oldest was the only one who understood I wasn't coming back home and having to tell him that and see him realize what was happening was the absolute worst experience of my life. It nearly killed me. At my low points I'd sit with a gun in hand for I don't know how long. Much as I hate my ex she probably saved my life cause I could just remember her saying how suicide was a selfish and cowardly thing. I didn't want my boys to think that of me after I was dead. So I kept moving forward.\u00a0\n\n\nHaving moved into my brothers basement I slowly started to build myself and my things back up. Having had my family ripped apart like that I completely gave up the idea of having any more children and got a vasectomy. Not long after I ended up meeting and awesome redhead who is now my current wife. I'll just call K. K and I clicked on so many levels emotionally, humor, sexually. feelings on religion, politics and much more. I never realized how selfish/cold my ex was until K showed me true caring and affection. She was the driving force that made it possible for me to get physical custody of my boys and everything. Her presence made me joyful to the idea of having more children. And having a child of her own. And to be a mother is her hearts greatest desire. So we decide to go all in and make plans for a vasectomy reversal and get married.\u00a0\n\n\nFast forward. K and I bought a new home and I took a different job. A job more in my field of education with way better hours. We have the vasectomy reversal done (and have been trying to conceive for a couple years but it turns out my counts are still low) and also look into her medical issues and start getting answers as to why she's usually in pain and getting things to help with her anxiety and depression.\u00a0\n\n\nWe both struggle with anxiety and depression. She had a better understanding that that's what she was actually suffering from and I really only learned how to identify my own after having been with her and understood more about it. I always thought it was just my A.D.D. that I struggled with for so long.\u00a0\n\n\nBack up to about a month ago I came home from work kissed my wife and after a bit headed to the store. While on the way I get a text saying she needed to let me know that she's been heavily fantasizing about being with me and another guy.\u00a0\n\n\nNow my wife and I are not prudes. We've talked about threesome and other things like sexual fantasies and we typically have a pretty damn good sex life. But once her statement sunk in it hit me SO DAMN HARD. I felt I was reliving the absolute worst time in my life when my family fell apart and I felt I lost everything. She helped me put everything back together, helped get my kids back, helped get our new house and she truly made it a home for us. I just could see it all getting ripped away again.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a lot of talking the thought of a threesome with another guy was in reality a turn on. But to her it isn't just about sex. She has a bit more of a polyamorous mindset. She understands that I can't do that. I told her moving forward she must be able to accept the fact that I may never be comfortable with that and shouldn't just be expected to. But the thought of a threesome was actually pretty hot for the both of us. It really revved up my dominant side and her submissive side. And we actually got to talking with someone who was into it. And he actually seems like a decent guy. Over the years she has been hit on by all kinds of men and always shuts them down and is always VERY open with me and what's going on and that's always made me feel better and able to trust her. In reality I don't truly believe she'd ever cheat on me but I'm terrified of her building an emotional bond with someone that will slowly sever our own bonds and she'll finally say she isn't happy being with me.\u00a0\n\n\nI have no friends to talk to about this. I'm 33 and don't know how to make a true friend. The people I work with are nice enough and I get along with them but they are not the type to truly care and listen and be there for me. No one I know is except K.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd here on monday we're going to know for sure if insurance is going to cover IVF treatments and we're pretty sure they will at least two treatments. Which is amazing news for the baby aspect of our life. We honestly held each other and cried when we made the appointment with the financial lady cause it sounded like we would be covered. We have this, one of the most important moments in our lives right around the corner... and its tainted by the thought of losing everyone and everything I hold dear. I'm so lost and alone about it all.\u00a0\n\n\nI just want to know I'm enough.",

Reception was a joke and was mostly boring as shit. I honestly wasn't taking anything seriously, I tend to do that. The day my reception company is slated to be transfered to a training unit in late January, my dumbass decides to wear the green thermals and waffle tops and bottoms. It was cold out already, and I was warned that doing what I was doing was very stupid. I didn't listen. Wore them anyway. Long story short, I get to my company (can't remember the battalion or brigade I was assigned to). I end up with Charlie company, 3rd platoon. Shit hits the fan I'm running everywhere and it's fucking chaos. My drill Sargent, Staff Sargent Lopez, and SDS Johnson are just ripping us. We head upstairs to our 3rd platoon bay. Everyone lines up and my big dumb goofy ass is literally the third or fourth person lined up in front of the ds. We're doing push-ups and 8 counts to the ds content. I give out, I can't take this shit. Really wasn't that fit and probably didn't belong there but my recruiter never made me do the pre physical workouts. Pretty sus but I didn't question it. Anyways I'm on the floor unable to do anymore push-ups heat exhausted from my thermal clothes. Ds comes by and starts saying just quit and you can go home. I'm thinking oh fuck that's a great deal. So I say yes. I was wrong. Dead wrong.  Like literally an hour later I realized I'm fucked, and I'm not leaving anytime soon. So the platoon heads downstairs to hand their personal bags in, I refuse for what reason I don't know why. Mostly I was just being an asshole. Hadn't got a call from my wife earlier when they allowed us to make a call (she wouldn't pick up). Things were just compiling and I had, had it. I wanted out asap. So I refused the bag again not really sure why. Ds got mad obviously and me being me I ran. Made it to the woodline and followed my way down to a railroad track. Planned on following it out of the base until I checked my bank account and realized I had no money (had my personal bag which had my phone in it). So I started walking back. My SDS found me and brought me back. I acted like I was going to kill myself because I thought surely if I act insane they won't let me stay. Well I was right and within a month I was discharged. I faked a suicide attempt and everything. My wife I found out was pregnant, I found that out when I was in basic when she wrote me a letter and that was what had really pushed me even further. But now? I feel bad and my whole life I've always just failed and I don't like the label of it. I really don't know what to do, and my dd214 doesn't block me from reupping but I don't know if I should. Or if I should go to college. Got two kids and I really just don't know anymore what I'm doing. I literally live day to day. The last two years since my first child was born I've been living paycheck to paycheck. And with no car and living in rural Ohio I often find no paychecks to be had because all the jobs are too far away and no transportation for me exists. Lately, I just sleep on the floor of my extra bedroom and stay up all night. Just wishing things would get better, and that all my efforts would mean something.",

That doesn't exist, so I keep living, and sometimes life is not so bad. So I guess it works out.\n\nAnyway, I just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship, and I've been sad the past few days. So I called up my sister for coffee. I was ten minutes late to get coffee, because traffic, and she had called the cops and my ex. I'm sure she was worried, I did tell her i've been feeling suicidal lately, and I don't have a phone at the moment. But the cops had me there for hours. I just wanted coffee and like a sandwich, ugh.\n\nAnyway, the \"Mental Health Officer\" was aggressive and so ready to take away my rights and check me into a psych hospital. I had to maintain my composure, cooperate, and be sure to say all the right things so that I didn't get locked up basically. And hope my sister did the same. I felt like I was being treated like a criminal for being sad.\n\nThe funny thing is, my ex beat up my brother and sent him to the hospital to get stitches on his head a few months back. There was blood everywhere when the cops arrived, but they didn't arrest him. I was there when they were speaking to him, and they showed him more respect for him and were way less threatening than that \"Mental Health Officer\" was with me.\n\nThen my sister was talking about how she needed to always be able to track my truck. I was like, absolutely not. I have the right to my own privacy. I'm not a child. I'm not a danger to anyone.  I'm just sad. Like why do people think they have the right to treat you like less of a person, undeserving of autonomy.

The parents especially (now my adoptive parents) helped me grow as a person, but what they and my siblings (including my adoptive siblings) don\u2019t understand and what I won\u2019t tell them is just how much guilt I feel and how much of a burden I feel like. They\u2019ve spent so much money and time on me and I\u2019m not even their biological child. They have done so much for me and I\u2019ve done almost nothing for them. I\u2019m in college and am a full time student, and I\u2019m having a bad semester and I feel powerless. I want to be a doctor or a PA (Physician assistant) because my mom was a PA and was in my opinion, the pinnacle of human kind. She was one of the most selfless people you would ever meet, she worked 80 hours a week to take care of us, and when my uncle lost custody of his youngest son, my mom took him in until she passed away.

I live it because I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I let them down. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if someone that loved me became disappointed in me. I\u2019m not doing the greatest in biology and that only makes it worse and makes my hope of becoming a doctor or a PA so much harder, it endlessly haunts me to think of my future as a failed older sibling who couldn\u2019t keep their promise, their dream. It makes me cry, I\u2019m endlessly haunted by the guilt and fear of the future and it\u2019s what pushes me through life, and it surprisingly gets me acclaimed because of how I try my hardest to do things in school, even if I don\u2019t get the best grades for them. My roommate has called me one of their role models because of how I \u201cWork hard and stay humble\u201d but only if he knew why I stay humble and don\u2019t get upset very often, then I wouldn\u2019t be.

I am 29, be 30 in January. 3 years ago i fantasized about suicide every day and was on anti depressants. I had a good job(software engineer) but felt like I was an imposter pretending that I was capable but failing at everything.\n\nThen one day i had my car die and i could not afford a new one for 3 months. So i started taking a bus to work and walking home(that is a 7 km walk, takes me 90min walking. I found out my work had a walking group and joined it(previously I would eat at my desk because I felt like I could not leave for lunch. Also I was eating 2 ham sandwiches every day now i eat 3 lbs of veggies and 2 large eggs. Got a personal trainer, I don't do much next to what is mentioned above plus i joined and now run a boardgame meetup group every monday, only 3 members most weeks, but if lucky 6. Have a workout buddy for the weekend. Went from 285lbs to 240lbs, I am 6'1(healthy would be 220lbs).\n\nUse to drink 4 beers everyday and would binge up to 10. Now i microdose weed(legal here) and on a bad week have 4 beers. Also I do not have weed everyday, some days am completely clean.\n\nI still live with my grandma, i still do not have a car. I fear that changing those things will destroy all my progress. I look at myself and still see a fat tub of lard staring back at me, even though people compliment me on how much progress I have made. My friday nights are dead. I want a girlfriend and get responses on bumble but give up thinking of how pathetic I am before meeting them. Afraid its too late for me when it comes to having a relationship. I want to live but think of how much damage I have done to my body. I am no longer on anti depressants. I am looking for a psychologist for anxiety but not sure if that will work. I need more friends but don't know what tp do. Dear reddit any advice on what to do next?",

         "selftext": "When I was younger I was very sheltered and took it hard when I realized how much bad stuff there is in the world. Ever since I learned about things like the flaws in our government system and stuff like rape and genocide, I just couldn't feel happy anymore. I would cry all the time thinking about how really bad things are happening to people right now. \n\nMy family eventually got tired of me being upset all the time and would get mad at me every time I got upset about something. So, after that, I had this edgy mindset that nobody really cares about how you really feel. So I kept trying to just be a likable person. I would smile and compliment people and wear makeup. I would lie to people all the time to make myself seem more interesting or enjoyable to be around. I really wanted/needed(?) people to like me. Hell, I'm pretty sure I still do. My only goal in life at that point was to just make everyone at least feel ok with my existence. It was exhausting.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger I was very sheltered and took it hard when I realized how much bad stuff there is in the world. Ever since I learned about things like the flaws in our government system and stuff like rape and genocide, I just couldn&amp;#39;t feel happy anymore. I would cry all the time thinking about how really bad things are happening to people right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family eventually got tired of me being upset all the time and would get mad at me every time I got upset about something. So, after that, I had this edgy mindset that nobody really cares about how you really feel. So I kept trying to just be a likable person. I would smile and compliment people and wear makeup. I would lie to people all the time to make myself seem more interesting or enjoyable to be around. I really wanted/needed(?) people to like me. Hell, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I still do. My only goal in life at that point was to just make everyone at least feel ok with my existence. It was exhausting.

         "selftext": "Right now I'm going through a bit of a tough time dealing with a problem I have always faced whenever I find myself slowly crawling out of depression: extreme levels of frustration, self-pity, restlessness, and doubt. These emotions are usually what lead me back into another downward spiral that eventually leads to another episode where I do nothing but lay in bed, do nothing all day, and basically go stir crazy from the eventual boredom that sets in when I grow numb. These feelings are very gradual and take months to manifest, but once they do it all hits me like a train and I'll immediately become overwhelmed. \n\n  \nFor a bit of backstory, I was NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) since November 2017. The following March I was hospitalized due to the onset of a psychotic episode mostly spurred on by abusing Adderall, which I felt I had to do in order to help me accomplish everything I felt I had to do to untwist the coil of disorders within my head and actually work toward my goals in life. It led to extreme burnout, no sleep, and turned me into a twitchy mess of a person. Following that, I was essentially a bed-ridden lump that participated in absolutely zero activities; even video games couldn't hold my attention. Saw a new doc last april, and finally started improving my mental state due to the right blend of medications. Back on adderall, but on a more controlled dose with additional meds to help with mood-stabilizing and depression. A few weeks go by, I feel slightly less willing to stay in bed. 2-3 months after, I felt relief that the thickest layer of the depression that was weighing me down was dissolving. Then around last month, I felt extremely angry at myself and completely anguished with the sudden burden of having to now unfuck my life as quickly as possible, mainly because I'm two years away from 30. Hardly any basic life skills and no accomplishments to my name other than a BA in English and no debt.   \n\n\nI can't distract myself without meds, but at least I can work and be productive when they're active within my system. Then when they wear off the anger returns and I'm unable to sleep due to thinking how much time I wasted wallowing in an emotional pit and doing fucking nothing; gaining fat, gaining weight, no life to call my own. I want to learn new skills, maybe develop a new hobby, but everytime I try to read an article or watch a video on YouTube, I always immediately feel dumb and inferior to the people speaking because they're usually my age or younger, more educated, more well-spoken, and have their shit together in general. Whereas before I'd just shut down and become the human equivalent of a rock with moss growing on the surface, I've become bitter and jaded. I feel like I'm missing out on life because I'm afraid that if I participate, people will eventually realize how much of a friendless loser I am and reject me completely. More and more failures will build up and eventually push me into a depression so deep I might not bounce back. They get longer and longer with each cycle. The higher I try to go, the lower I get when my wings melt and I come crashing down to earth.   \n\n\nNot sure if anyone feels similar, but I want to know if it's possible to ever go from bitter and angry at myself to satisfied and somewhat content. I don't want euphoria. I don't want a picture-perfect life. I'm fine with losing weight, improving my body image issues, correcting my mindset, and \\*maybe\\* meeting someone I can relate to enough to want to form a meaningful relationship with.",

         "selftext": "***INTRODUCTION***\n\nFirstly, I would like to note that I am fully aware of the fact that, both the world and no-one owes me anything and I am not saying that they do. I also acknowledge the fact that the world, for anyone and everyone, is not a sunny, brightly-coloured green scape, happy doo-dah - it truly is a cruel, gritty world.\n\n***BACKGROUND***\n\nAnyways, who am I? I don't know who the real me is hahaha. But being serious, I am a 20-year-old currently in his second year of University, studying a Business degree in the UK. Unfortunately, I have been suffering from depression and (albeit, it not as strong) anxiety for, what I feel like, forever. All I can remember from my childhood is a great deal of trauma, sadness and suicidal ideations. I refer to my depression as falling into a hole, and recently, the hole has become a permanent home.\n\n*(PART OF EDIT#2)*\n\nI should also note where I am with the NHS. Following my first A&amp;E trip, I was referred to the NHS' Wellbeing Service. I met a 'Mental Health Practitioner' of whom I found lovely but it was determined, that essentially, they did not have the resources to properly look after me - I'm too much of a nut-case for them! Prior to my second meeting with the practitioner, I had called the NHS' Mental Health Rapid Response Service and expressed my willingness to kill myself that night, hence the second A&amp;E visit. As a result of this, I was made an urgent referral to the NHS' 'Assessment and Treatment Service' where it would be determined that I will see a psychiatrist to review my medication and I will have regular meetings with someone. However, whilst it is great that I have these opportunities, I feel as if I am too far gone, too far to save, too lost to find because, at the end of the day, I am me. I will forever be me.\n\nFind the links below if you would like to read up on the services I have been through so far :)\n\n*(END OF EDIT#2)*\n\nI have recently started medication for depression, Sertraline (100mg) and Mirtazapine (15mg). The former was originally prescribed at 50mg and was on such for about two months before the dosage was increased and the Mirtazapine being added on. So all in all, as of writing, I have been on anti-depressants for, give or take, two and a half months. I have come close to killing myself four times now, the first, I was taken to A&amp;E by paramedics - of whom were alerted by myself as a result of calling the emergency services (I had ALOT to drink that night and as such, was highly motivated to end it all). The second time, something happened, something quite silly in hindsight, which brought me so close, REALLY close to suicide but alas, I drove myself to A&amp;E. The third time, this time was a big step for me ahaha. I took my prescription Diazepam (5mg) all in one, so 5 pills, a bunch of prescription-grade paracetamol and I mean a BUNCH, and to top it off, I drunk near half a litre of vodka - my favourite go-to alcoholic drink! Unfortunately, my flatmates found me and took me to A&amp;E where I was treated - blood tests concluded that it wasn't toxic enough of a cocktail. Boo-hoo. The most recent event, I drove to somewhere quite far, a headland where, in that area anyway, is very well known to be a popular suicide spot and as a result, there are volunteers, a Chaplaincy Suicide Intervention Team. I remember it being such a dark night, heavy, torrential rain, my car shaking - I think I was more scared for my car than myself! I'm a new-ishly passed driver here in the UK and I've never driven such conditions, first time driving through a flood that night! Anyways, I turned into this road and I see these bright orange lights on top of a vehicle and that woke me up, it brought me out of my depressed state, so I flashed them hoping they'd stop and they did (I had no idea there such teams put in place). But, I spent a good two hours talking to them about my condition and what I was going to do that night, and to be honest... I don't know why I drove there, I don't know if I would have jumped. I haven't prepared any letters, nor have I said proper goodbyes.\n\nSee the thing is, I tell myself, that, that's all I need to do to be ready. To write my letters and say proper goodbyes, say I love you, I'm sorry and thank you to the appropriate people. But, I can't bring myself to it. I'll have my gorgeous fountain pen touch the paper, but I feel myself, not wanting to do it... I think about my siblings and how I don't want them to turn out like me, I want them to be both, mentally and physically sound, unlike me. I would much prefer myself suffering from all the mental &amp; physical illnesses both known and unknown to man than my siblings to suffer as I have. But I feel as if, it is inevitable.\n\n***CAUSES***\n\nWhenever I talk to someone, whether they're from the NHS or a student councillor (or someone relatively similar), the question of, 'Are you aware of the roots?' always get brought up and my answer? \"I don't know\" with myself not even able to look at them in the face as I say those three words. The truth? I am fully aware of the causes. There are many, but here are what I think are the main two:\n\nI am the oldest child and, by proxy, the first child my parents ever had. So I guess in a way, I was the first batch to experiment on. Anyways, I was physically, verbally and emotionally abused, mainly by my father. We immigrated to the UK when I was quite young, so British values wasn't really a concern nor was it known by my family at that time. My father used to shout at me whenever I didn't do something right and if I was naughty, he would hit me, perhaps excessively. This would go on until my second sibling came around, about 8 years later, it started to die down (the abuse), but it internalised inside me, that abuse was the only way you can get stuff done. So, I became my father's shadow, which is something I am so so ashamed of. I was hard on siblings, very very hard. I hate myself for becoming my father's shadow, and whilst my father is no longer the same dad he was, the old him now is me. I have created an environment for my siblings where I don't see myself being connected to them in the near future. My father has problems with gambling and at times, this creates such great, disturbing arguments with him and my mother, my siblings and I are always on the sidelines hearing them fight. I get involved most of the time, blaming my mother, which is something else I am ashamed of, and seeing one by one, all of my siblings run to their bedrooms, destroys me. In a way, I deserve every bit of this depression and I do not deserve to get better. In no way, do I expect to get better, and the only way to escape my depression is by suicide.\n\nThe second cause? Schools.\n\nIt all started in primary school, I was bullied in my first primary and as a result, my parents changed schools for me. However, it didn't end there, it wasn't as severe as I mention later, but it did scar me. Anyways, moving onto secondary school (UK equivalent of High School), I went to a good school, one of the best performing schools in my area. All I can remember is lower school (Year 7 - 11) and how bad of a memory it was for me. People laughed at me for stuff I couldn't change physically and the torment went on pretty much every day of year 7. I used to do stuff to hide my physical parts, which resulted in a bad back. I never really made any long term friends, I'm no longer in daily contact with the friends I have made, which is upsetting for me because all I can see on social media are them being in contact. The abuse I received from my peers never really ended, whilst it did die down, it carried on regardless by some and never ever stopped. Daily, I was reminded of me, I was reminded that I am me. I have grown to hate me, I don't want to be me any longer. Being me, is the last thing I want to be right now. The abuse was so bad that in classes that I had excelled in, I purposely failed to be moved down sets (sets being allocated from, essentially, the smarter kids down to the dumber kids). I had aspirations to be a Doctor, just anything in science - I wanted to make a positive impact on the world. But the daily reminder of me, being me stopped that. Now, I am studying at a university that I don't like, studying a subject I don't like, and now my future is a career I don't see myself enjoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately, I won the flatmate jackpot, they are all lovely people and honestly, they are the sort of people I wouldn't have been friends with at school, so whenever they do things that friends do for each other (something I have never really experienced), I am so so surprised, and it brings on such great joy for me.\n\n***OTHER STUFF***\n\nNow onto the other stuff, the stuff that 'pushes' me into my 'hole', the dark dark hole. Firstly, I would like to refer back to my point about no-one nor the world owing me anything, and I stand by that, they don't.\n\nI am in my twenties now, and I have never experienced teen-love. The fact that I haven't experienced something so great like that, depresses me, it just reminds me of me, me me me. I am not good enough for myself, so why should I be good for someone else? Recently, there's this girl in my group for this project we are working on. She's beautiful and sweet, alas, my condition and me being me, it won't ever happen. I do try to flirt but I don't know how to... I give her lifts back home from time to time but I don't know if its just her sweet, kind nature but I can't read her and if she's giving it back, so I pull back and don't do anything in regards asking her for something as silly as a drink. It's selfish to see someone as my saviour and I acknowledge that I am not saying that she must date for me to get past this illness, it's just that rejection has been a major part in me being reminded of me. Whenever I get left on read or something awkward happens, I hate myself for it, I become so angry at myself. It would have been nice to hear the words \"Happy Birthday\" from her but, even with her right behind me, she didn't say it... She didn't even ask how it went, so I guess, why should I try hey? I always get panic attacks when she throws a jab at me, which I can't tell if it is serious or not, regardless, I hate myself!\n\nAlcohol has been a problem for me, and I have been bringing vodka and OJ to my lessons - nothing like a bit of Dutch Courage hey? I've mixed it before with my valium, and its a hell of an experience. Whilst I don't recommend it, it blacks me out and I that's all I want - blackouts, and I want it to be forever.\n\n*(EDIT)* I forgot to add,\n\nTo compensate for my bad past, I create memories that, in my mind are true and real. These memories to others, are true and I hate that. That to be someone that people like, I have to lie.. I also create these future events, I imagine myself and the day to occur in such a way where it feels as if I'm different, as if something good will happen, and that's when reality hits. That's when I am reminded of myself.\n\n*(END OF EDIT)*\n\n*(EDIT #2)*\n\nUnfortunately, the student life advisor that I have grown fond of, in the sense that I feel comfortable enough to talk to about everything (which I have never ever done before, she is the first person to know about my school and the trauma I had experienced), is sadly leaving my university. I don't know if she will ever read this and realise who 'HeyimAM123' really is, but if she does,\n\nTo Ms J,\n\nI know I've said it before, but I cannot thank you enough, thank you for being a person and not a brick wall for me to talk to, thank you ever so much. Every talk I have had with you was a rope thrown out to me to bring me out the hole. Thank you again.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to add that, Wednesday was, unfortunately, a horrible day for me. I was in the library with my group, working on the already mentioned project, and I had a panic attack - what caused it? The retrospective girl made a harsh remark... I was joking around and I told her something along of the lines of, \"Your bits a bit shit, you know? haha,\" and she comes back at me, telling me I had been useless, that I had done nothing. I'm sure she didn't mean it &amp; like I've said, I can't read her, probably because I am socially inept. To make it worse? I know it sounds silly, and probably it's my anxiety causing me to overthink but her (male) friend noticed her and they seemed so happy talking to each other. As a result of both, I had a breakdown and I had my greatest, biggest panic attack - it was horrible... What brought me out of it was the girl saying, \"you look stressed\"... ha, I felt like I was going to pass out!\n\nThat night, I wanted to kill myself and I felt so exhausted and felt like my mind was on fire, I couldn't stop the thoughts. To distract myself, I brought myself to my 6 pm lecture (the lecturer knows of my condition, but not its full extent in how impairing it is). I had a chat with him after which, honestly, saved my life that night. I won't tell him that, but, it honestly saved me. So instead, that night, I took a valium pill and washed it down with 75cl of vodka, straight, which is a first for me. I blacked out and woke up, still feeling drunk - I went to sleep at 7 pm and woke up at 6 am, in hindsight, perhaps, I should have died, I wished that I did.\n\n*(END OF EDIT #2)*\n\nTo **conclude**, to my siblings, I am sorry for all the bad I have done. Please try your best at school, I know you will all excel in whatever you do, and regardless of what you do or whom you become, I will forever be proud. To my parents, thank you for all your sacrifices and I am sorry for any wrong-doings. To my flatmates, thank you all for being the friends I have never had. I am sorry to all for being a plague, for being this disease, this annoying blob that I am. I truly am sorry for being me.\n\n***LINKS***\n\nMHRRS - [https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/MHRRS](https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/MHRRS)\n\nWBS - [https://www.brightonandhovewellbeing.org/](https://www.brightonandhovewellbeing.org/)\n\nATS - [https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/service-east-sussex-assessment-and-treatment](https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/service-east-sussex-assessment-and-treatment)\n\nPlease note, that the services the NHS has provided, so far, has been an excellent experience and I could not praise their staff enough.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would like to note that I am fully aware of the fact that, both the world and no-one owes me anything and I am not saying that they do. I also acknowledge the fact that the world, for anyone and everyone, is not a sunny, brightly-coloured green scape, happy doo-dah - it truly is a cruel, gritty world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, who am I? I don&amp;#39;t know who the real me is hahaha. But being serious, I am a 20-year-old currently in his second year of University, studying a Business degree in the UK. Unfortunately, I have been suffering from depression and (albeit, it not as strong) anxiety for, what I feel like, forever. All I can remember from my childhood is a great deal of trauma, sadness and suicidal ideations. I refer to my depression as falling into a hole, and recently, the hole has become a permanent home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(PART OF EDIT#2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should also note where I am with the NHS. Following my first A&amp;amp;E trip, I was referred to the NHS&amp;#39; Wellbeing Service. I met a &amp;#39;Mental Health Practitioner&amp;#39; of whom I found lovely but it was determined, that essentially, they did not have the resources to properly look after me - I&amp;#39;m too much of a nut-case for them! Prior to my second meeting with the practitioner, I had called the NHS&amp;#39; Mental Health Rapid Response Service and expressed my willingness to kill myself that night, hence the second A&amp;amp;E visit. As a result of this, I was made an urgent referral to the NHS&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Assessment and Treatment Service&amp;#39; where it would be determined that I will see a psychiatrist to review my medication and I will have regular meetings with someone. However, whilst it is great that I have these opportunities, I feel as if I am too far gone, too far to save, too lost to find because, at the end of the day, I am me. I will forever be me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find the links below if you would like to read up on the services I have been through so far :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(END OF EDIT#2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have recently started medication for depression, Sertraline (100mg) and Mirtazapine (15mg). The former was originally prescribed at 50mg and was on such for about two months before the dosage was increased and the Mirtazapine being added on. So all in all, as of writing, I have been on anti-depressants for, give or take, two and a half months. I have come close to killing myself four times now, the first, I was taken to A&amp;amp;E by paramedics - of whom were alerted by myself as a result of calling the emergency services (I had ALOT to drink that night and as such, was highly motivated to end it all).

I truly am sorry for being me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MHRRS - &lt;a href=\"https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/MHRRS\"&gt;https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/MHRRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WBS - &lt;a href=\"https://www.brightonandhovewellbeing.org/\"&gt;https://www.brightonandhovewellbeing.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ATS - &lt;a href=\"https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/service-east-sussex-assessment-and-treatment\"&gt;https://www.sussexpartnership.nhs.uk/service-east-sussex-assessment-and-treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please note, that the services the NHS has provided, so far, has been an excellent experience and I could not praise their staff enough. Everyone has been what you would expect from someone working in the mental health field &amp;amp; whilst I feel that I am too far gone, this isn&amp;#39;t the NHS&amp;#39; fault, it is all mine. Nothing can save me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was really into the pop punk / indie scene and a lot of the music was pretty sad. I felt too much almost. I read way too deep into things that maybe weren\u2019t even that deep.  I got into a long term relationship for about a year and then got broken up with. After the breakup I genuinely couldnt stop crying. I would go days bawling my eyes out and being so hurt over it. This lasted a year+ honestly. The breakup seriously broke me. Then i slowly started to heal but with \u201c healing \u201c I feel like i lost touch of feeling altogether. I\u2019ve cheated/played a lot of females due to this and I feel no pity for them when they come to me and cry to me about how bad ive hurt them. I do feel a little bit sorry because theyre hurt but i personally just dont feel hurt that much. I feel like i didn\u2019t heal the way i was supposed to. I feel like i healed by not caring and that has made me lose touch of something I valued heavily throughout my life. I used to love that about myself about how I could feel and care deeply about things but now I simply just dont care? I dont take a lot of things seriously when i probably should. Does anyone have tips? Does anyone feel this way? I tried listening to some old songs that used to make me cry when i was younger but i feel absolutely nothing. Idk why I want to feel what I felt before? Its so weird and strange because why would anyone want to feel sad but i just havent felt so deeply hurt and sad in so long that it feels strange and I want to get in tune with the feeling just once more because as I said I just feel so numb to everything. I wanna fall in love again but Im scared that because of my last relationship and the hurt it brought emotionally\u2014 that ive closed off permanently from any type of emotion and connection towards anyone",

In those 5 days I noticed that I started feeling in touch with my actual emotions for the first time in months, and I decided I wanted to try going meds-less for a couple weeks to see if I could cope, since in retrospect, I really hated that detached feeling.\n\nI ended up heading into one of the worst spirals ive been in in.... maybe years? Ive almost completely forgone my personal hygiene shit at this point, ive had several days where i havent been able to get out of bed at all, I haven't seen any of my irl friends in months (although, theres additional reasons for that). \n\nI was hoping to move out again before Christmas and this has massively thrown a wrench in those plans.\n\nWorst part is that when i finally decided i needed to call the doctors to see about seeing them, they wouldnt see me for 2 weeks.\n\nI guess thats, backstory though, it isnt really what i wanted to post about. There was 2 things I really wanted to vent out into the world\n\n1) why the fuck do I get to be the person whos been to some therapy and some counselling, so I know all the tools for mindfulness, i know all the aphorisms, all the methods. I know how to use my words and thoughts to lead a mentally well life, so why the fuck do I get saddled with the brain that doesnt work with them. Last time I had 1 on 1 counselling my councillor would say to me that my mind is like a bus, the only person in control of it is me. I said back to her immediately \"have you seen speed?\" and she pauses and goes \"the sandra bullock movie?\" and i remember being absolutely flabbergasted that 1) she didnt connect what i meant in terms of metaphor, and 2) she called Speed a \"Sandra Bullock movie\" and not a keanu movie. Jesus. That being said, I still feel it stands true. I think all the advice ive been given is really good for people who are relatively neurotypical, but dont function for someone like me.\n\n2) what the fuck am i gonna say to the doctor today? \"oh yeah those meds i was on, turns out they were doing wonders, but also i hate them because they make me feel less human. What else ya got thats exactly the same but different\"? Also what if other meds dont work? Or they do work and they have the same effect on my connection to my self? How am i meant to grapple with being an almost functioning human being whos numb to themselves, versus being an absolute mess whos still able to feel things. \n\nThanks for reading, I think",

But what we really experience is mere loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I think back to my grandmother's funeral, I remember crying, I was definitly upset, but I wouldn't say I was sad, I don't know If I was, mainly because I got over her death within a week or 2, mind you, I lived under the same roof as that women since I was born. And when It comes to being happy, I can't really remember a time I've been happy, and truth is, I have no interest in being happy, I just want to be as I was, when I was depressed.

This has been a continuous cycle, where one of us feels depressed the other one helps and we are always happy to help because we love each other very much, this time is different however.\nAbout 2 weeks ago she started to act a lot differently, not really engaging in conversations, I got a feeling that she was avoiding speaking to me and I tried my best to figure out what was going on so I can help her, but she wouldn\u2019t tell me anything other than \u201cI need alone time\u201d so fair enough, I gave her alone time, I wouldn\u2019t text her for hours and we would just not talk all day, I was content with this because I thought it was helping but I was wrong.\nShe texted me a week ago saying that she wanted to meet but I got a weird feeling about it, I offered to give her a lift to my house but she insisted on walking which is very unlike her because she is quite lazy and it\u2019s a 30 minute walk. \nWhen she got to my house she just hugged me and broke down into tears, we lied in bed together cuddling while she cried on my shoulder for about 10 minutes, I was just allowing her to let it all out before I said anything, eventually she looked up at me and asked if we can talk with the most heartbroken look I have ever seen her give me.\nShe explained how she wants to go on a break because of her horrible depression she feels like she needs alone time, which I thought was fair enough because I can\u2019t force her to stay with me but it hurt to hear because I know that this is eventually how relationships end.\n\nWe just sat and cried for 30 mins before she left.\n\nOver the last week, I have watched her descend into a place I had never seen her before, a dark twisted place where she admits to not really caring about anyone anymore, she constantly has thoughts of suicide and never tells me she loves me anymore.\nI haven\u2019t seen her in a week but I can tell by the tone of her texts that she is not herself right now and needs serious help.\nShe is neglecting everybody who cares about her, myself, her mother, her grandmother, basically her whole family who she was very close to prior to this. \nI have suggested getting help to her which I have done throughout the 2 years that we have been together but she declines my offer every time because she has her mind fixed around the idea that \u201ctherapy doesn\u2019t work\u201d I just don\u2019t know how to convince her to get help because I know that this will only get worse but I don\u2019t want to let her drag her down with me, I have been crying everyday after we split up out of fear that I will never see her again, I just want her back. \nI have thought about emailing her university\u2019s mental health team to ask them to have a look at her but I don\u2019t want to \n1. Possibly humiliate her in front of her class and make it worse \n2. Interfere with how she is feeling, which she has asked me not to do\n\nI understand that we all need time alone but this is clearly different, I\u2019ve seen her be depressed before but this is honestly much worse than usual, I am incredibly worried. \nI would love some advice on how to handle this, she is my everything and she is losing herself, we had plans for a future together but I don\u2019t see us recovering from this. She really needs help to get herself back on track but she is denying it.\n\nThank you for reading this far. Please offer some advice on what I should do here, I feel helpless and terrified.",

My latest diagnosis is severe chronic depressive disorder with psychotic features. I\u2019ve been labeled everything. As a teenager it was constantly trying to figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s going on with L\u201d.... doctors, psychiatrist\u2019s, therapy, church counselors my parents wanted me to see. I first really attempted suicide at 14. When I was around 7 is the first time I really remember the thought of killing myself came into my head. I also have ptsd. That add on came later, after spending over half my life engulfed in addiction at its worst level. I\u2019ve been homeless, sold myself, pawned anything ever worth any value, stolen, etc. I hated myself even more for what I become because when I started using drugs, I felt like I belonged in my skin and at ease with my place in this world. No depression. No constant urge to off myself. I had never had joy like the drugs gave me I thought. It was all quit in my mind. Obviously, that turned on me. It all was tangled up as my one \u201cmonster\u201d. Times passed and I\u2019ve \u201cgot my life back\u201d you could say. But here I am 25,  back under my parents roof.  No real job outside of I dog sit. I never finished my education and study now, but I\u2019m so behind. My depression never leaves. It never even left like I was tricked into believing on drugs for that beginning period. Some days it\u2019s hard to get out of bed. I used to have so many friends here in my hometown. Old friends fee like strangers now. Even though it\u2019s my fault we grew apart and fell out. I don\u2019t know how to talk to people. What to say. How do I explain my in and out of their lives so frequently? I disappear on people. The world gets too big and I hide. I don\u2019t fee like I have a rightful place in the lives of others. I work really hard to not be overly hard on myself and ease up on the self fucking hate but I don\u2019t get to far with it.  I\u2019m lonely. My mind is still my worse enemy. I wanted so much more for myself by now. I isolate because I don\u2019t trust myself to go out and not do something I\u2019ll regret. I refuse to relapse. I got back on meds for a while, they didn\u2019t help. Relatively speaking, I\u2019ve made a 180 from what life was 2 years ago. I\u2019m grateful. But I still can\u2019t figure out how to be okay. My insides ache. I don\u2019t know how to describe what depression has been for me besides it\u2019s a literal ACHE that I feel in my chest and radiates our up to my head and down my arms and legs. The act of breathing is hard and forced because it hurts so much. like a weight that\u2019s been suffocating me slowly my whole life. I\u2019m constantly over analyzing myself and make the best aspirations to help myself and keep going but tonight It all is closing in on me, again. Nothing bad happened today. But I\u2019m exhausted and aching. I don\u2019t like to cry but I want to. What\u2019s the point to anything? To any of this? More times than not I feel like a hamster on a hamster wheel.

         "selftext": "I've made one other post here explaining my descent to where I am currently. Since then I have left home in efforts to get a new start. I'm now about 500 miles away, thankfully staying with family so it isn't as bad as it could be. With that said, whatever curse that has brought me here seems to have followed. The week I moved, I was evacuated due to some very serious fire threats. I spent a week living essentially as a transient which was, unpleasant, to put it nicely. Thankfully, the house wasn't lost but, the place of work I applied to had suffered catastrophic losses from said fire so my chance of employment was gone. Since then, I've been religiously looking for and applying to other places of work that cater to my skill set and work experience but I've been met with rejection email after rejection email. Because of that, self esteem is at an all time low and I'm seriously concerned about whether or not there is something inherently wrong with me as a person. Then, on top of all of that, the person I am interested in pursuing a future and a romantic relationship with, mind you, my entire reason for moving in the first place, had told me that she wasn't ready for a serious relationship. I was trying to work towards her because I know for a fact that she makes me immeasurably happy. She completes me and and she is what I need to help me through a time like this. Unfortunately, that can't happen right now. Now that isn't that big of a deal for me. It sucks, sure, but I understand that people are different and need different things in order to be willing to take on such a matter whether it's time to think and prepare, or space to collect and ready themselves, etc. And I've been alone for essentially all of my life so it's not something I'm not used to. However, that and all of these other things (There are more than what I've listed but I don't want to get too personal) continue to pull me further and further down. No matter what I do, this... thing, this bad energy, if you will, seems to follow me anywhere I go. At this point, I'm tired. I'm tired of giving up so much of what I've worked for. I'm tired of feeling like I'm getting nowhere. I'm tired of trying everything I realistically can in order to improve myself and get my life back on track when literally everything I've done or attempted to do has backfired in one way or another. It's been a constant one step forward, two steps back situation for a little more than two years now. The sliver of hope for myself I have left is fading faster every day and it's just getting too difficult to try to see through this.

Since then I have left home in efforts to get a new start. I&amp;#39;m now about 500 miles away, thankfully staying with family so it isn&amp;#39;t as bad as it could be. With that said, whatever curse that has brought me here seems to have followed. The week I moved, I was evacuated due to some very serious fire threats. I spent a week living essentially as a transient which was, unpleasant, to put it nicely. Thankfully, the house wasn&amp;#39;t lost but, the place of work I applied to had suffered catastrophic losses from said fire so my chance of employment was gone.

It finally got hammered into my head today, because while I was working I only got two uboats finished today when I usually get 3-4 done. My new manager(the guy who trained me when I started a month ago recently got promoted) came into my aisle while I&amp;#39;m working the second UBoat and points out that it&amp;#39;s almost time for me to head out and that I need to pick up my speed, then as he was walking away said he might need to put make me a cashier... I can&amp;#39;t be a cashier, I would literally rather die. When I&amp;#39;m working as a stock crew member I get to go around the whole store and because of this my day is different Everytime I go into work. Before I started working their the only two days of the week I knew had passed were Monday and Friday because every day was so mundane everything blended together and while that still happens to an extent my new job has been helping with that. If I get out on cashier duty I might just put my two weeks in and quit. I&amp;#39;m not good at anything, I&amp;#39;m just exceptionally subpar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've written paragraphs upon paragraphs, notes upon notes. I cant anymore. I just want to sink back into everything and just be at rest. No deadlines, school, work... just peace and quiet. I want to disappear from my life, and hope I'm forgotten. Sometimes I just want to grab my things and run out of school. I want to go to a place where they cant find me and just sit and look around me.\n\nI'm wondering about what they'd think. How they'd react. That someone out there would miss me. I can't feel how they feel when I'm like this. The worst thoughts come out when I'm alone, and the only people I can talk to are on the internet. I want to sink back in to self harm and be more depressed, so I'd maybe have the courage to cut myself. I hate how I don't behave like that. Maybe someone would care. I want to fall away and cry, so that someone would notice, and not use that stupid line of, \"It's gonna be okay\" because we both know for fucking sure that it's not.\n\nI'm so tired of trying. Everything I did and everything I do is for nothing. I havent gotten better. I havent been happier. It's all just a quick little spark anyway. Even when I'm happy, in the moment I know it'll go away. I want to vent so badly, but I have no one to vent to. My friends are leaving me behind and it just makes me wonder all the things I did wrong to get to this point. Losing the groups of people that actually made me happy for those that wont stay with me just makes me feel worse. I wish I could die. Just die. So that SOMEONE. SOMEONE WOULD CARE. I have no hope left. I just want to wait here for a while. Just wait until the day comes that I'll break past my mind's conscious and go through with it. I'm sorry.",

From hotline chats to online subs. I&amp;#39;ve even asked for answers from people I look up to. I&amp;#39;ve written paragraphs upon paragraphs, notes upon notes. I cant anymore. I just want to sink back into everything and just be at rest. No deadlines, school, work... just peace and quiet. I want to disappear from my life, and hope I&amp;#39;m forgotten. Sometimes I just want to grab my things and run out of school. I want to go to a place where they cant find me and just sit and look around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering about what they&amp;#39;d think. How they&amp;#39;d react. That someone out there would miss me. I can&amp;#39;t feel how they feel when I&amp;#39;m like this. The worst thoughts come out when I&amp;#39;m alone, and the only people I can talk to are on the internet. I want to sink back in to self harm and be more depressed, so I&amp;#39;d maybe have the courage to cut myself. I hate how I don&amp;#39;t behave like that. Maybe someone would care. I want to fall away and cry, so that someone would notice, and not use that stupid line of, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s gonna be okay&amp;quot; because we both know for fucking sure that it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of trying. Everything I did and everything I do is for nothing. I havent gotten better. I havent been happier. It&amp;#39;s all just a quick little spark anyway. Even when I&amp;#39;m happy, in the moment I know it&amp;#39;ll go away. I want to vent so badly, but I have no one to vent to. My friends are leaving me behind and it just makes me wonder all the things I did wrong to get to this point. Losing the groups of people that actually made me happy for those that wont stay with me just makes me feel worse. I wish I could die. Just die. So that SOMEONE. SOMEONE WOULD CARE. I have no hope left. I just want to wait here for a while. Just wait until the day comes that I&amp;#39;ll break past my mind&amp;#39;s conscious and go through with it. I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

         "selftext": "My psychiatrist referred me to a neuropsychologist and I took over five hours of tests. One of the tests was an IQ test, and the neuropsychologist showed me that my IQ was pretty high.  He said I was wicked smart and I shouldn\u2019t let that gift go to waste. It did make me feel better but when I got back to my place, a flood of thoughts entered my mind and I was back to the same state I was before I found out my results.\n\nI\u2019m currently failing two classes and I withdrew from a third class. I ended a relationship that lasted one year. I lost the trust of my parents and I just got over my porn addiction that I\u2019ve been suffering from for 7 years. I\u2019m changing my major so I can go to medical school, but the task seems so daunting.\n\nI feel pretty lonely. My roommate has autism so he\u2019s unable to communicate or socialize properly. I go to a university that for the most part has commuter students, so most of my friends live off campus whereas I live on campus. \n\nI have type 1 diabetes and the university doesn\u2019t have any healthy options in terms of diet. I can\u2019t perform well academically if my glucose levels are all over the place. I do exercise and try to maintain my levels, but it\u2019s difficult to find any sort of motivation. \n\nI\u2019ve got it all though. I have a family who loves me, I have friends that want the best for me. I was given $32,000 from my university and I\u2019m doing well enough on my own.

         "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist referred me to a neuropsychologist and I took over five hours of tests. One of the tests was an IQ test, and the neuropsychologist showed me that my IQ was pretty high.  He said I was wicked smart and I shouldn\u2019t let that gift go to waste. It did make me feel better but when I got back to my place, a flood of thoughts entered my mind and I was back to the same state I was before I found out my results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m currently failing two classes and I withdrew from a third class. I ended a relationship that lasted one year. I lost the trust of my parents and I just got over my porn addiction that I\u2019ve been suffering from for 7 years. I\u2019m changing my major so I can go to medical school, but the task seems so daunting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel pretty lonely. My roommate has autism so he\u2019s unable to communicate or socialize properly. I go to a university that for the most part has commuter students, so most of my friends live off campus whereas I live on campus. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have type 1 diabetes and the university doesn\u2019t have any healthy options in terms of diet. I can\u2019t perform well academically if my glucose levels are all over the place. I do exercise and try to maintain my levels, but it\u2019s difficult to find any sort of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve got it all though. I have a family who loves me, I have friends that want the best for me. I was given $32,000 from my university and I\u2019m doing well enough on my own. I have a gift to excel in my classes yet I continue to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been in two bad relationships consecutively.

Sorry if this is all over the place, I really just feel lost and have a lot to get off my chest.\\*\n\nI lost my mother to liver failure around two months ago and I was there when it happened. It was supposed to be a peaceful passing but it was far from that. Hospice came in a started the procedure as usual, but then left and it was just my family and I left to deal with the aftermath. After several hours and multiple instances where we thought we were saying our final goodbyes, she passed. Throughout those several hours, there were multiple occasions were she would cough up blood and would have labored breathing. This has stuck with me ever since. However, recently I've been having these spells of feeling like my heart is stopping and I cant breathe. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and I called an ambulance.  I went to a hospital and they told me it was anxiety attack, and that I should seek therapy. I have never had one before and it terrified me. Not only that but they keep happening once or twice a week.\n\nI took online school for my high school years and I am very introverted. I have not had a girlfriend yet and I do not drive. I was smoking carts (liquefied THC or marijuana) and it would allow me to focus on a game or show and loose the thoughts of dread for awhile, but I always did it behind my parents and relatives backs. This was before my mothers passing and I would do it at night while I before I would sleep and it would allow me to calm down and relax to fall asleep. After I went to the hospital, I told my father that I was smoking and have been off of it for about a month, which wasn't hard for me to quit but it just made me feel like a failure in his eyes. He was very supportive and understood why, and said that he would do anything I needed to get better and assured me that he was not disappointed. But, I feel like I just added to his grief and things to worry about.\n\nOn top of everything else, my grandfather died last year and my grandmother died two weeks before my mom did, and no one was able to go visit her in the hospital because we were with my mother. Now, its just me and my father in a apartment that my uncle is paying for and my dad is working a very labor intensive job and he is in his late 50's. He is overweight and has many medical problems such as high blood pressure and needing a knee replacement. He only makes around 200 - 300 dollars a week off his paycheck, and our monthly expenses are triple that. My uncle is helping us for the time being, but he is also in his late 60's. This is causing me to be afraid that I will loose both of them soon too if I don't step in and help. \n\nAnother thing is I've lost all interest in anything I do. I used to enjoy video games and watching content online and I've come to find that they just make me anxious for some reason, almost uneasy. I have also stopped exercising and going out with friends, and trying to put on a facade when I see them at college once a week (I take two online classes, two on campus). I find myself putting on a select few videos that I have seen before to just drown out the white noise of being awake.\n\nI keep having these thoughts that I am behind my peers and it causes me to get angry at myself for slacking all those years away in high school and not trying.  My family has been struggling with poverty since I was 7 years old, and I lived in a motel for 8 years of my life. Then we moved in with my grandparents and most of the time, it was fights between my family and my grandparents, causing a sense of hatred for grandparents. We lived out of a single bedroom and bathroom, often resorting to walking around the mall or park for recreation seeing as we didn't have money.\n\nAdditionally, I was told at the hospital that I also have insomnia and it has become much more prevalent in the past two weeks. I usually fall asleep around 9 am and sleep till around 2 or 3 in the afternoon after being awake for 24+ hours. The doctor prescribed ambien, but I am afraid to take it on the fact that addiction runs on my family. I have been trying Melatonin to no avail, and I just feel lost. My diet has taken a hit as well, and it seems that sometimes I am starving while other times I am overeating. My weight is fluctuating.  \n\nHer birthday and my parents anniversary are two days after thanksgiving, and Christmas was her favorite holiday so it just seems like I have nothing to look forward too. I have nothing to look forward too anymore, and I feel lost. Schoolwork is SO hard to do, and I often loose focus and motivation all together but somehow I am still getting A's and B's.\n\nI just feel like everything is spiraling out of control, and my mind is constantly mush. I don't know what to do. Typing it all out feels a bit better but I feel like this isn't a long term solution, so I was just curious if anyone has gone through the same thing and can give me some incite on how to get my life back on track.",

That still leaves a lot of time.\n\nWhen I was in college, I had a semester where I was go go go! I took advantage of every minute, didn\u2019t go back to my dorm. Wake up early for class. I\u2019d go to the library and study, go to the gym, walk around. I said to my mom, \u201cthere is so much time in a day to do things! Even 15 minutes is valuable!\u201d\n\nToday? I will sleep until 11:30 am. Play video games until 2:30pm. Get ready for work. Get out of work, stay awake playing video games until 2 am and repeat.

         "selftext": "I dont even know where to begin with this and warning it'll be a long rambling mess and sorry if this aint right sub to post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lifes a mess. Mentally I and so worn down and tired for about 2 years now but lately its gotten really really bad and I dont know how to fix it.  I guess the TL:DR My step papa died to cancer when I was little, my gran died in 2017 and in the same year my papa (mums dad) was diagnosed with cancer. This year my other papa (biological dads dad) died. I have a serious health condition that nearly killed me a few years back, my little sister looks to have the same thing but she's worse than I was at her age so im worried for when she gets to the age where my condition \"peaked\" and got to its worst. My best friend has a serious health condition. Basically everyone I care about is dying or just really Ill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so helpless and alone I've struggled putting on a smile for them all for so long but I dont know if I can do it anymore my heads been so down for so long now.  Honestly at this point the only two things keeping my going is that my best friend and my papa need me. \n\nBut the longer I'm spending in the bad headspace the more im convincing myself that's not true.  I have a massive family I'm the only one that seems to look after my papa and visit every day but if I wasn't there I'm sure without me someone else would and that's the only reason they don't visit so honestly he'll been fine. then he won't be when he dies. Which as harsh as this sounds I catch myself thinking he only has a max of 3 years to live (docs said could be anytime but they guessed 4-5 years to live when they diagnosed him 2 years ago)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd my best friend is usually the ONE person in life I've never doubted or had a bad headspace about and she's always been there for me. But lately my heads been gettin to me even about her.  When I first started feeling really down she was going through her own shit so I never told her like usual and also cause I can't go to her every time I feel down etc it ain't fair on her.   Then we met IRL (we met as online friends and don't get to meet much due to both of our health conditions so there's a legit reason but every time other than the first meet its been me askin for it which is another example of how my head can just make a hill out a hole or whatever the saying is) and temporarily I felt amazing top of the world. \n\nBut I noticed she was tryin to hide how bad she was right enough about 30 min later she can't hide it anymore worst I've ever saw her (her words and I agree) she said anyone else she woulda cancelled cause she felt really bad before leaving but cause it was me she didn't wanna cancel (even tho she has numerous times in the past) I get train with her then get her in a taxi home safe, she messages me saying thanks she's going to go sleep now she'll message me a proper thank you later.  I get a message a few hours later asking how I am I reply and she just doesn't open it or message me at all for a solid 48 hours so considering she was worst I saw, her family have a habit of just leaving her home alone days at a time and to top it all I had a nightmare of her dying (more on that later) so I start getting really really worried and I message her ex cause I know their still friends and more \"on a break\" to find out she's \"been in a call all day\"  Ex tells my friend who messages me apologising sayin voice is easier when sick swears she thought she replied to discord messages and wasn't notified about snaps cool whatever long as shes okay thats the important part.  \n\nThen she barely replies to me and tells me sorry I never replied earlier im just sad and to down and talking to people is such a burdern rn which I fully get cause ive self isolated myself from basically everyone. But then I see she's been talkin away without replying to me on discords and playin games with people when we haven't played in weeks and once again always me that asks where she used to ask and we used to play every day. So I guess she doesnt actually need me after all she has her ex and these others friends that can be there for her if I aint there that my head keeps sayin must be so much better and funner than me (Which really ain't like me I've never ever EVER been the jealous type legit any other point in my life id be like HELLS YEAH YOU GO GIRL like I'm usually not a high maintenance friend in the slightest one of my other best friends I've known from I was like 5 we go to diferent colleges diferent professions only meet rarely but it's always like it's only been 5 min)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly there's the nightmare I've been consistently having every time I actually manage to sleep. Long story short it involves somethin bad happening to best friend, her messaging me and me not getting it till hours later due to bad Wi-Fi connection, me showing up to her house and she's dead, I go for a walk in the dream lost and a mess then I finally return to my papas house to find he to is dead nobody could get a hold of me either. The dream plays out like that every single time and the thing is it's half true one day I will lose my papa to cancer thats a fact and my best friend has been suicidal in the past and also theres been a lot of break ins at her area especially targeting business and her family has one (which is another reason im worried when i dont hear from her)  \n\nThe most worrying part is I've only ever had a consistent dream once in my life and it involved my biological dad trying to kidnap me from a shop. And then after being plauged by these they only stopped after we visited him at a mental hospital rehab thingy for his alcohol and drug addictions, I was about 6 at the time he let me play gta and tried to get my to drink some alcohol I assume someone sneaked in for him. My mum grabbed me and my brother and we left being chased by him shouting and screaming how we're his kids and he has the right to keep us and she cant keep us forever and he'll take her to court.  \n\nSo while not word for word as insane as it sounds the only persistent dream I've had came true in terms of overall theme I guess?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nearly died the other day (my inhaler was empty I was walking home alone I couldn't breathe could barely walk, nobody was expecting me or would notice was around midnight) and honestly I didn't feel scared I felt relived. I snapped my best friend saying you're the best thing to ever happen to me I adore you always remember to always put you first.   \n\nAnd the after sending it I felt relived. And that thought scares the shit out of me cause death is it far as my beliefs go. the end. no afterlife no second chance. I'm to much of a coward to commit suicide I hope but ever since I felt relived I was dying and the more and more I convince myself that my papa and my best friend don't need me the more I have these bad thoughts about a bride into a river that's only a 5 minute walk from where I stay.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so yeah if you read this far thanks I guess I just had to tell someone but I couldn't tell my best friend like usual cause even tho its just my head blowing everything up and she hasnt done anythin wrong I know how deeply she cares about people and I dont want her to feel bad plus honestly this is just far to much and far to heavy for me to tell anyone I actually know it wouldn't be fair on them.   \n\nIma keep on fighting and puttin on a smile for people but fuck its getting hard.  (Sorry for typos/errors/makes no sense. I'm writing this on mobile at 2am. I'm up at 6 so I guess its go sleep now and I'll probs check this again in like 24 hours when I inevitably cant sleep but everyone else is so I dont need to take a smile)  truly thank you all for letting me vent/listening.",

         "selftext": "I went to counselling a while back for treating anxiety and possibly depression after one particularly bad summer when I didn\u2019t go outside for about 2 months. It just left me more confused about what I\u2019m experiencing and if I should seek further help or not. I went to have a test at the doctors to see and they returned with the answer \u2018you probably\u2019  have the symptoms of depression and anxiety, would you like to take x,y,z medication. I said no because I thought at the time I was on a path to something better.\n1 year later and I\u2019ve took steps to make my life better, with a lot of effort, it\u2019s been incredibly hard. I\u2019ve started getting out more, got a job over summer and started doing swing dance. The only thing I look forward to in the week is swing dance and even then if the session goes bad I come out feeling a lot worse,\n  I seem to never be able to get enough sleep or sleep to much.

I went to have a test at the doctors to see and they returned with the answer \u2018you probably\u2019  have the symptoms of depression and anxiety, would you like to take x,y,z medication. I said no because I thought at the time I was on a path to something better.\n1 year later and I\u2019ve took steps to make my life better, with a lot of effort, it\u2019s been incredibly hard. I\u2019ve started getting out more, got a job over summer and started doing swing dance.

Tomorrow I&amp;#39;m being discharged with no place to go and no kind of income or support. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing&amp;#39;s changed, I still feel absolutely hopeless and tomorrow morning I&amp;#39;m on the street. Not sure why I&amp;#39;m writing this, guess I just needed to vent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This was about 2 years ago, since then I have come across various issues about myself, the world and about the people around me which they will probably not notice until they get older. I thought that maybe if I study enough and try to work towards some kind of great goal such as immortality life would gain meaning or at least would be enjoyable, but I soon again realized that if I don't remember most of what happened to me 3 years ago, how would I go about for a 1000 years, I would eventually forget the person I once was, the books I read, everything might just become more meaningless. I don't find much meaning in doing anything anymore, but I'm still in my hormonal phase so depression can't drag me down too deep because I will always come back up with some messed up feeling of mania ( and that cycle continues between wanting to be productive and feeling like \"nope\" )\nI can see my life stretch out before me, or well the rough list of how it's gonna go down. I keep going to school everyday which I hate because of my messed up sleeping pattern which I have tried to fix many times, then I'll end up in a high-school in which I'll learn in my mother language about something I would want to learn in english, and it will be hard to readjust and it will not be very productive ( I wanna learn sciences which will have different terms in my language ) then I might go to uni if im really lucky or just a community college if I'm not, and then I'll probably realize that I can't get any job that I'll actually like or maybe I'll drop out before that happens and I'll be homeless or living in a really bad place. \nAnd I'll have to bear these thoughts every day for that period. It's already getting hard to do my work, but I'm also feeling worse because my grades have gone down in subjects I was interested and invested in but now just don't want to do anything with them most of the time. I go to school in which I try my best to stay awake and survive while feeling really shitty, I come home, I fall asleep from not sleeping enough, I waste my time with playing something or listening to music, I feel bad, I stay up until 5am in the morning thinking about stuff &amp; life and scrolling through reddit, I fall asleep and wake up, repeat. And I'm not even gonna go into the newer traits of being a teenager, gender dysphoria and my insecurities about being inferior in intelligence or smarts than most people. I'm just complaining here about problems I don't really have because I'm pretty sure I'm making them up to somehow feel special or different, I really don't know anymore. But if you read this mess of a text, I gotta thank you, have a great day!",

So today I finally took it upon myself to go visit the doctor and see if I can get any help. \n\nI just wanna day one thing though. Going to the doctor took a lot of courage for me as I am so embarrassed by my mental health and people look at me and think \u201cthere\u2019s no way she has mental health, maybe she just wants attention\u201d. Anyway.. when I went in to explain I was very nervous and as I was asking for help and explaining I felt as if I was being judged. The doctor was rushing me out.\n\nGuys, I have been wanting to ask for help for 9 years and I\u2019ve finally worked up the courage to do so I was so nervous my voice was cracking and my eyes were getting watery but i hate to show too much emotion. All in all I got no feedback, all the doctor said was that she would put me on a waiting list that could take about 4 months for this therapist and said \u201chope u have a good rest of day\u201d. I went into my car and broke down. I\u2019m not mad at the doctor of course but I was already nervous enough, I was disappointed. If she only knew how much this little meeting meant for me. About a month ago I took all of my propranolol prescription pills all 28 of them, but because it was 10mg each pill I just felt very relaxed and had a good sleep. It was then that i realized that how I\u2019m feeling is messed up and I went to get help. I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s not easy, I know for a fact that I don\u2019t want to die I just want to get better.

I\u2019m trying but it\u2019s not easy, I know for a fact that I don\u2019t want to die I just want to get better. I want to feel normal, if your a physician and someone comes in to talk about anxiety, depression please don\u2019t rush them. Just listen I\u2019m not asking for anything the least I could have gotten was an ear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
