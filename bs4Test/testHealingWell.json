                "comment": "Hello Everyone!Today I had such a postive experience from a mild dissociative episode on Friday10/25/19.For near 3 weeks, I have been waking up and think to myself, \"1 more day alone\" I have no family and my husband left me last year.Knowing isolating only makes things worse, I forced, myself to to a local book sale. I had 2 boxes of donations for them tooI bought 2 large bag of books, however I wrote in my journal the experience was not fun and did not find anything speacial.Today 10/27/19, I went through the books.20 in all. 7 large prints that were free, I sell them on ebay.The other 13 were special in their own way6 of them date from 1836 - 1921 I adore antique books!So, amazingly, even though I felt on auto pilot, I was actually looking for things I liked. I believe I turned my emotions to numb. I know I dissociated because it is a bit foggy, except for driving home.What I take away from this is, once I decide to get out and challenge the urge to isolate; using mindfulness may not be necessary, although it would enhance the expierence. For me, mindfulness would make it easier the next time.We all forget skills, being in survival mode takes a lot of energy and beating ourselves up is not going to make anything better.So self-compassion and mindfulness together could help us challenge isolation.PeaceTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

                "comment": "Two years ago, a car struck me while I was crossing the road. I later learned that the driver of the vehicle had a suspended license and should not have been driving.I sustained a number of disc bulges and herniation in my neck and back due to the accident and had to undergo chiropractic treatment,  physical therapy and other medical treatment for one year. Although the treatments helped somewhat, I still experience intense back and neck pain; it is so bad sometimes that it hurts to move or lie down.  The accident has greatly impacted my life, and I can no longer due the exercises that I used to due. It has also caused me additional expense because I have to pay for chiropractic treatment as I have no health insurance.I got angry today due to my back pain. It literally feels like my back is going to fall apart.My mom and another person told me that I need to forgive the driver, not for his sake but for mine, but I wonder how true this is. Do you really need to forgive someone to move on? I don't think so. Yes, I still get angry at the driver sometimes, but I have accepted my new reality and 'moved on' as I really have no choice. Forgiveness can be a great release for some people and help them to move on with their lives. However, for other people, forgiveness is not necessary for healing.  I have told my mom and another person this, but they say I am wrong.  Telling someone that they need to forgive can be more detrimental for some people IMO. Thanks for listening to my rant."

I had years of abuse from my family during childhood.  2011, suppressed memories popped.What I have learned in therapy are the following, I hope some of it helps you.  None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.  Scared their Camelot lives would be shattered. Even to day,  When I sit in stillness, I find peace.  I have no anger towards them.  I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on. I believe forgiveness is different for each person.  Maybe when that person is no longer renting space in your head, that will be it for you.I wish you Peace, comfort and strengthTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

Well, it only snowed for the last 13 miles.  Go figure.  I didn't do much in Utah because I was so tired.  I took two naps yesterday and still went to bed at 10 pm and woke up at 8:30.  The last time I felt like this was years ago when I started taking effexor.  It made me so sleepy my kids started to complain and I stopped taking it.  But I have been on duloxetine for a year now without any changes.

I spent the night in town last night because going home and coming back would have been something like 5 hours total.  And then the office closed down early today so that we could all get home before the next wave of snow came.  The snow doesn't bother me, as long as it's not windy, but spending so much time in the car gets old.  Bought diapers for my mother in law and potty pads for the dog on the way home today.  Going to the grocery store for my mother in law (and a little for me) tomorrow after my med appointment.  Work on Thursday, taking MIL to ortho in Denver to get a knee injection on Friday.

It is serious to handle alone.  So glad you reached out.  You have landed in a soft, validating and support place.   Do you have any pets?  I have always had dogs.  Had fish for a while also, but to much with the tank, filter etc...Walking helps me,  sitting the park and watching kids.   I watch baseball.  Don't follow it or any team,  I enjoy the game, the plays etc.... Most days I have force myself to do things, but once I get going I feel better.  We deserve more than we feel,  I practice self-compassion and mindfulness.I honestly would not know where I would be without these skills in my daily life.  Heck these aren't even skills anymore,  it as become a change of life style for me.  I have become more thoughtful and gentler in many ways. Here is a link I hope that will help you. https://www.mindful.org/how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/ I meditate.  There is a app INSIGHT TIMER, download on your phone.  It is free.  If you don't find something you like uninstall it.   There is music of all kinds, beginner guided meditations.

So interesting that you start to feel better when you smile and laugh. How long does the feeling last?Buena - flipping the switch- I like it, very visual and almost automated. When you switch off do you immediately go back to depression or is it more of feeling you can be yourself again? That is horrible about your evaluation- sounds very unfair. Sorry to hear that. Bnotafraid- I'm glad you're feeling better coming off from months of struggle- good for you! Kids can be so entertaining- and wise beyond their years sometimes.

Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener."

But just because you feel your problems are far less serious than others doesn't mean it doesn't count.  They are your issues and are very important to you.  So remember that.  I imagine that the group therapy is interesting.  I have never done group, but some others here have.  Some people thrive in that kind of setting.  I don't think I have enough confidence.  I don't know why.  I don't do good around large groups of people.I am glad you are reaching out here.  It has been kind of slow.  But the administration is working on making it better so more people can join.I hope you have a good day today.Hugs, Karen...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies"

We are now 10 in the group, so it is probably the most we should have to maintain a certain amount of control by the moderator.Once more this week there were a few people who were using up most of the two hour time.  I thought  we would be sharing our experiences and our various ways of dealing with our demons.It was uplifting though, as depression has many facets and they all come out.   There are still a few who are shy about discussing their personal problems.  I did find a more relaxed atmosphere in the room.Each week we are given assignments. Small things we can do to cope.  This week we are going to keep a rough agenda of our activities on a daily basis.  We will review next week.So far, so good."

We never got on the topic of the trauma's.  I am glad it is helping you.One more thing.  If I would you,  remember that your pain is pain.

We seem to be grasping anything we feel will help us.The first week as we were introducing ourselves, there were sad stories spilling out of people that made me feel my situation was of a lesser importance ( Less depressed than others )My Depressions are rather different than most as they come and go with no apparent reason.  It has alway been that way for me.  The saving factor with this type of sickness is that I know I will get better.I have to  admit the periods of relative freedom from depression come less often.

Bad days good days. If they are having a bad day, it is all they can do to stay present, let alone see that someone is in stress.  Also, when a member is new, they are in stress, anxiety this is normal and most groups, let them work it out themselves. The thought behind this is, besides the welcomes, the person needs to find the strength themselves to attend.I was a facilitator for 3 years, then I was working on some bad stuff from my past and I stepped down.

This Thursday it will be the fifth week of the ten week gathering of the group exercise.  You are right about the personal problems that our moderator had, until we gave her some positive encouragement.

It is interesting to watch people relax more and take part in our helping each other.In general, it is a rewarding two  hours a week which is bearing fruit.

                "comment": "cloudy said...HiFolks.It has been a few years since I put anything forward on the Depression site,  but I have had Depression  during all this time.My depression comes and goes with no real regularity.  Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener.I would have the same problem, being attentive to everyone else and being a good listener.  I tend to be an impatient person, and while I can easily be empathetic with the struggles of someone else, I'm afraid my impatience would come through.  It is eye opening, though, isn't it, that perspective you gain when getting out amongst other people and discovering that many people are at least as sad as you are, and some are much worse, with good reason.  I often feel like my sadness is something that doesn't make sense and wonder if I am MAKING myself sad for a reason.  Many people have so much more to deal with than I do.  Keep us posted on how this group therapy works out for you, please.Denise"

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.  I have been giving much thought to my parents.  Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.  As I deal with my personal depression, I have been enlightened to some degree with this group effort.     Finding it therapeutic"

                "comment": "I'm sorry that you missed the opportunity for a heart-to-heart with your father.  That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.  But wouldn't it be so sweet if it were possible that I could get that hug I so desperately needed/need and want and you could have that heart to heart talk with your father.Post Edited (MitzMN) : 10/22/2018 5:33:04 PM (GMT-6)"

                "comment": "We all have our life stories.  I am in my late 70's and I too have suffered periods of my upbringing and later times more dramatic and full of stress that I have overcome.  We all would do things and think things out differently if we could turn back the clock.People who tell you they \"would not change a thing\" are not being truthful.  There are always regrets over lost opportunities, lost loves, lost friends and any number of situations.  In my case I have lost close friends for reasons I can't explain.  This  in particular has happened  with what I considered 3 times in my life.  In each case these people are still alive although they live in different areas of the country.  The fact that they have all had great financial success  must be a factor.  Monetary wealth seems to cause a breakdown in shared interests and the ability to share experiences.  Although I am not poor and struggling, I don't regret being lower on the social scene.With the group therapy exercise I am presently involved in, the other people who suffer with depression also have very diverse backgrounds and an endless stream of problems, both real and perceived.  Lives that have been shattered by deaths, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and other mental problems.I don't know your personal present situation.  I hope you have someone close.  My wife is my savior.  She has learned to understand depression and how to react to my occasional outbursts of tears and depressed thoughts.  I don't profess to be religious, but I envy those who find all the answers through total dedication to a supreme being.That's enough rambling on for now.     Everybody hurts sometime."

Oh well, life goes on.We spent much time talking about sleep deprivation caused by depression.  I was the lucky one, as I don't have trouble getting to sleep.  Everyone else has trouble sleeping without   aid of medication.  It would be interesting to know the percentage of depressed people who suffer from insomnia.  I am sure that there are stats on the subject.With the darkness hours increasing, we discussed procuring \"Sun Lamps\".  apparently they help if you have one near you in the dark.  My knowledge of these is nil.   Will someone please enlighten me?Another topic we approached is commitment to get back to things we enjoy doing but have lost interest in, or the energy to take part in  because of  our depression.  We have all made promises to get back to doing things we previously  did and found to be fun.All participants agreed we are making progress"

For example  \"Emotional reasoning\", jumping to conclusions without knowing what a situation entails.   When depressed we think immediately a negative answer to any possibility of a stated fact that involves decision making.The real way to look at things is to weigh the possible negative or positive answers and come to the right conclusion.That was just an example of \"filtering\" our thoughts.We had a breakdown of one of our people today.  The person has a very complicated life, and some emotions became too much to deal with and required an early exit from our meeting.  This caused a sad reaction from the rest of us, as we felt unable to help.  We thought maybe a hug was in order, but it was rejected. We still feel we are being helped.  There is no chance of us not getting to the 10 week completion.  Some are wishing we could make it last longer."

Not to give them more negative thought than they deserved.   The leader gave us a list relaxation techniques  to reduce anxiety and stress.The friendship of the group continues to grow."

                "comment": "Hi there       9th session of 10We talked  in some detail about going back to work after somewhat long periods of time off for treatment of Depression. This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.   This is just an example of personalities picking and choosing which topics most applied to them."

The general feeling is that the interaction among all present was mostly enjoyed in that we all had gained something because everyone was suffering from the same thing.  Before each get together we would greet each other with \"how was your week?\".  In general the responses were some good days and some bad.With the exception of one or two people who did not enjoy the efforts of our moderator, the exercise was deemed a success.  We had all filled out a list of answers to general questions in our first meeting.  We answered the same questions at the last and checked to see if our outlook had changed over the 10 week period.  There had been someimprovements.The next step is to have a one on one meeting with the therapist to document and evaluate our experience andget some feedback  in order help us to work on things more specifically as individuals.I should mention that there was an incident which happened during the meeting. A person in an connecting roomwas screaming loudly and had to be removed by security.  This had an effect on our group, as it was of course frightening.   One must admit that in a department treating all levels of mental illness you could expect the oddproblem.I should say again that we were provided with much useful material and web sites selected by the  departmentthat will remain useful to us."

Having you talk about it has probably made others more apt to try it.  Thank you for all of your sharing.I hope you are having a nice day.  Somebody brought me a puppy on the 21st.  It was a much unexpected surprise.  She is a black German Shepherd, I named her Luna.  She is a hand full.  It has been cold here so yesterday was the first day I took her outside, she loved it...  My birthday was on the 22nd so it was a nice birthday gift.  I wasn't expecting to get a puppy until spring.  By then she will be getting bigger and I will be able to take her for walks.Take care Ian...Thanks for writing.Hugs, Karen...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)"

She said I had shown 20% progress and I show a \"borderline\" Depression.My conclusions are as follows:1.  Being with others that share the same sickness is beneficial, as one does not often get a chance to interact with      them and gain the trust in sharing episodes of ups and downs of our daily lives.2.  The organized and carefully planned subjects given from week to week, and with times to reflect on our       experiences helped a great deal.3.  in general it was a worth the effort and most of the group has had a positive attitude and would like to look     into further  classes."

It amounted to rehashing some of the things that were discussed during the course we followed, and an update since we had not seen each other for about 7  weeks.One of our group was admitted to hospital during the Christmas vacation period.  He spent about a week and according to him, it did no good.   He felt isolated knowing that it was not easy to leave the unit even if he wanted to. I can relate to that as my psychiatrist has an office near the entrance of the inpatient unit. I have often thought how it is important that I stay well enough not to visit this place.All in all, we still think our therapy sessions was beneficial to most of us.  Those who did not share this feeling did not last the 10 weeks.  We will meet again in February."

My mother was in a psychiatric ward at the state mental hospital when I was a kid.  I remember going there.  It wasn't so much what I saw but the things I heard.  This was in the 60's though and things have changed a lot since then.  As I got older I noticed the changes.  But when I was a kid, it sounded scary.  I know hospital stays are beneficial for many though.  I am glad that your meeting went well.  I hope you continue to see these people (maybe some friends now) again.

This makes sense as it is always good to meet more people suffering along with you.It was a one hour session to just talk to each other and report progress. For myself, I found it was not enough time to have conversations among the 8 people taking part.  We meet again in 2 weeks.  Our Nurse moderator mentioned the fact that psychiatric nursing  was thought to be much less important in Medicine in general.I think this may be true.   Other illnesses seem to take precedence."

I agree with you about psychiatric nursing being thought of as less important, though it is very important.  So many people suffer with depression during this day and age.  I think it is going to be sunny here today though clouds do roll in.  We have had a hard winter and a lot of snow.  I am going to get my hair done and other than yesterday at the endo's office it will be the first I have left the house in a week.  So I am looking forward to getting out.  We also got a new dollar general in our little town and I want to go see it.  It will definitely be appreciated, as all we have is a convenience store/gas station and prices are real high.

I do think, however, that this friendship isn't worth it if this person stop talking to you over an unintentional mistake . It sounds a bit immature to blow off someone over something insignificant. Is it possible that something else is going on in this person's life which has nothing to do with you?You should go to the harvest festival and sell your paintings. Interacting with people might cheer you up. You might develop new friendship with people you meet there Enjoy your life and have a bit of fun. Forget about John, his family, and girlfriend. Don't let them take up any more space in your mind. They aren't worth thinking about Put them out of your mind and heart. Their enjoying their lives, so you do the same.I was in a bad relationship once. I was so upset and angry and constantly thought about that person. My therapist then told me something I never forgot. She said \"...the best revenge is to live your life and forget about them\". You should do the same. Who knows...you may meet someone worthy of your thoughts and affection.And your not alone, you got your online family and friends here. I know the holidays can be tough, but try to remember that it's just one day. Maybe you can volunteer somewhere on the holidays. A soup kitchen perhaps...helping other people might also ease your pain."

It is hard enough to make ends meet.  I am sorry about the mental health situation too.  I just found out today that my endocrinologist no longer takes my insurance.  If I want to continue to see him it will be 120.00 a visit.  I might be able to get reimbursed through Medicaid but I kind of doubt that.  Plus I have to come up with the initial 120.00.  This is for diabetes.  But I am going to see if my pcp can prescribe my medications.  I can get blood work done at the hospital I think.I sure do hope that things work out.  They say where one door closes another one opens.  I hope for both of us, some doors open.  It really stinks when things go wrong.  Just keep hanging in there.  Don't give up.  I wont either.

He can probably do your blood work too.  Did you know there is a new gadget that can do your HbA1c right in the office, like a glucometer? But It's hard to have to give up a doctor you have been seeing for awhile. Jamie, what do you mean when you say you are going to have a \"Captain Cook\" at the gym? Are you happy spring is coming?

It was so warm that day in November.  I also remember a 70 degree day in January once.  My grandmother said it once snowed in July.  So you never can tell.  I just wish for a more mild and shorter winter this year.  It would be nice, but I guess we just take what we could get because we can't change it.

Well, I lead a VERY low-risk life - exposure to the flu would be quite unlikely.  And I have an auto-immune disease, and these things make responses to vaccines a bit unpredictable.  Should my life circumstances change, and I were to become much more social and be around children or others that are likely to be carriers... of course I'd get a flu shot.I believe in dancing the fine line between being Prudent and being Paranoid. lol"

Hard stuff!!I was in Wash D.C. for the 1976 bicentennial also!  Graduated in 79.  I loved winter,  was always outside,   well I was outside all year round, so winter does not really count. I made to the Harvest Fest.  Stayed off my feet, except for caring for the dogs, until Friday night. Sold 3 paintings and some book marks.  Well done, considering the crowd was 1/2 of what was expected. Thing is you never know who will buy what,  size of crowd does not really matter. I was wrecked on Sunday,  physical limitations were pushed on a 14 hour day.  Slept most of the day Sunday. Speaking of burgers,  I think I will go to a place named the Pour House, best burgers around here.  I don't eat meat much,  but when I do, I go there. Peace all.

We are working with primary care, dentist and orthopedics right now so it gets busy. Her daughter won't have anything to do with her and I don't know why.  My husband is perfectly happy shirking his responsibility and since he's not living here it's easy for him to do.  I'm not particularly attached to her, but I'm not going to be the one who puts her out on the street.  It's just her and I living here right now.  OK, enough kvetching.

                "comment": "Hi everyone, After going through serotonin syndrome from the increase of my previous antidepressant (Luvox), I was switched to Cymbalta. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder recently and have had issues with finding the right antidepressant. I'm starting to have some side effects and would like to know when they'll ease off. I'm getting a bit anxious and restless to the point of wanting to do something but can't keep my mind on said action. Is that normal? And I'm starting to have some issues sleeping. I've been on Cipralex with good success and wanted to be switched to that after I got off Luvox, but my family doctor switched me to Cymbalta. Should I have fought harder for that medication, or should I see how this new one works? I am feeling better, but I'd like to sleep better and focus. Here are my current meds:Cymbalta, 30 mgAbilify, 4 mg (at night)Doxepin 40-50 mg (at night) 29 \u00b7 F \u00b7 CanadaInactive pancolitis UC  \u00b7 Last scope: Zero inflammationAsthma, lactose intolerant, IBS, Sulfa allergy, B12 deficiency5-ASA intolerant, Imuran - very low WBC, platelets, stunted bone marrowLDN, 3mg \u00b7 Alesse 21 \u00b7 Doxepin, 60mgBiologics ruled out"

I have never taken Cymbalta, but was curious as to how long you been on it and when the side effects started.  Generally side effects go away in a week to ten days.  Some stay with you though.  I started Lexapro a couple of months ago and recently noticed constipation.  I have gained five pounds from it.  If I don't gain anymore I will still be happy but if it gets worse, I think I will ask about another med.  I would give the medication a chance, say six to eight weeks while you wait for it to get to it's full potential.  Then you should know whether or not you want to stay on it.I hope that it works well for you.  If you are feeling better mentally and emotionally that is a good sign.Hang in there.Hugs, Karen...PS  Sorry about the serotonin syndrome.  That must of been awful.Oh and just curious, I take abilify, was wondering why you take yours at night.  It probably doesn't matter.Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)"

I hope your side effects will go away soon!I've been on it for a week, and they started in the last 4-5 days. I've just phoned pharmacist to see why I was agitated and so restless. Apparently, there's a moderate interaction between it and my Doxepin, and I need to get off of Cymbalta and go on Cipralex. Surprisingly, I was doing better and feeling myself on it until the restlessness hit me.It was one of the worse experiences I've ever had. But I'm glad I'm not there.I was on Abilify in the morning, but I kept getting tired during the day, so I was told to switch at night, if that helps."

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.  It can be used as needed and can quit anytime without tapering.  The trick to it is \"low doses\".  (120 mg = 5mg elemental lithium)  Effective at just 5mg a day, wouldn't take more than 30mg)  :O)Post Edited (HJQuinn) : 9/28/2019 3:01:40 PM (GMT-6)"

I've been in remission for over a year now but fighting depression I guess as an aftereffect of losing 3 years of my life to UC.  I've been taking Lithium Orotate now for a month and I have to say it's nice to finally feel like my old self again.  :o)  I've experienced no side effects.  I take one in the a.m. and one in the p.m.  It seems to actually be helping my digestion as well because of leveling out stress in my body.  It's really nice.  Sleeping much better too.  Oh be careful though because it raises Serotonin levels so if you are transitioning from an SSRI drug to this your Serotonin levels could get too high.  It may seem like a side effect but it is just the SSRI is still in your system.   Once it levels out, there should be no side effects."

You have to sit down and figure out what sparked your depression and try to heal from that.I also got very frustrated with taking meds at first because I wanted a quick feel better pill.

My doctor told me it woul be 4-6 weeks, but this could be different for different meeds and different people. The feeling you get initally (Where you feel great) could simply be expectation. You have something that you have been told will make you better and because you expect it to, it does but the feeling only lasts for a short period of time so potentially, this is what you are describing. As for treatment, I believe that meds are simply a coping mechanism for depression. For some people it allows them to cope to the point where they feel they are able to deal with the root cause by themselves (Hence, the drug can be seem as the 'cure') but for others, they need that little bit of extra help in the form of 'talking medicine' (I cant remember where I heard that phrase but I think its great!   \u00a0 If you are resistant to meds then I would definately look into talking medicine either in the form of self-help or professional counselling. \nI hope this helps\nDarrenEveryone has a guardian angel.

When I told her that my dating life is non-existent, and I just don't care if I'm with someone or not, she gave me a vibe like 'poor you'. I seem to get this a lot when people, especially extended family, learn that I am 42 years old, no kids, and not married or dating.I really don't understand why many people think that being married/in a relationship is the end all be all for a person. What irks me the most is that most of these people are in horrible relationships.I haven't been in a relationship for years. And to be totally honest, I really have no desire to be in one. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm asexual. I mostly like being by myself although I do wish for companionship at times. I use to tell people that I want to be marry and have kids, but I now realize I was repeating what my family expected of me. I realize, through therapy, that it's okay to be single. I also think living in a big city, as opposed to a rural or small community, helps as there are a lot of people in the same boat.I just wish people didn't pity or think me abnormal for not being married or having kids."

I always thought I would have kids by this point in my life but I don't and I'm learning to be okay with it. The world is made to believe that happiness equates to marriage and kids but that's just not true. I like being alone as well. I'd much rather spend time with self than people who make me feel less than. I also just enjoy alone time and don't feel weird about it anymore like I once did.If people are pitying you that's based off their beliefs and not your own. Just keep doing what brings you peace. That's what matters the most."

                "comment": "Same boat here -- very familiar to me. There seems to be a stigma associated with not being married or having kids, particularly when you get into middle age. By now, most of my peers have at least teenage or college-age kids, often bringing up their family lives in small talk. All those experiences are foreign to me, and all I can do is nod politely as they happily and proudly talk about their daughter's piano talent, son's vacation escapades, getting into some great college, etc.There's definitely been pressure from family, even if not in so many words. They seem to have stopped asking about my relationships/wife only recently, perhaps realizing it likely won't happen. I have no siblings with children, and the family line will die off with me. This may be the biggest part of the pressure, which may have gotten to me -- i.e., I was made to feel as though I'm letting them down, and in the worst way possible.Not really sure how to get past this -- some people emphasize how they couldn't imagine life without their SO, how their kids are their reason for living, etc. For those without, what else can substitute?Not that I was ever against marriage, kids, and the \"normal\" or \"expected\" life, but I simply never found anyone, or maybe something about me always ruined things. Many years ago, I was even on an \"incel\" forum, long before incel became a four-letter word. I never found solutions, even if I found others in the same situation. That forum is long gone, thanks to the \"new\" breed of violent, cynical incels out there. There doesn't even seem to be a replacement term for the \"old\" ones.SWMMDD+PDD"

The managers disclosed my demographic info (my living sitch) to all my co-workers and anyone who walks into the store. The privacy of my sitch is nill when they never talk about anyone elses living sitch. If you are not sure where the mean girls go after they leave high school and college, well they work at the mall for the rest of their lives.The other day the manager had her family in to visit, I walked out of the store and they stood their in the mall lobby to say \"that's her\" and started laughing. I reported them a few weeks into the job and it just got worse and worse. I can't believe that managers of a fortune 500 company could be so petty and immature. I live with a sibling and we had to take my mom in because she was recovering from a bad illness that almost killed her. When I told some of my nicer co-workers this, they understood because they were taking care of their parents as well. The petty Bees thought that \"that wasn't the reason for my living sitch.\"The reason for my post is I'm just baffled about how to deal with this mean girl mentality when it comes to adults that have no compassion or even hearts.Any thoughts?Sucks2bsickP.S. I forgot the most horrible part. For awhile the manager was trying to piss me off and get me to quit by saying stuff like \"I think she tried to kill herself and that's why she lives with her mother.\"FYI: I have never tried to kill myself."

She had a lot to say during our sessions and gave what I felt was excellent advice.  However, when I was expressing to her about how I was feeling and what was bothering me in my life at the time, she would interrupt me too much and start giving me advice.It's impossible for a shrink to never interrupt you during therapy sessions.

I think just the fact that you KNOW your thoughts are irrational is huge. I just read something today that made sense to me. Whenever you're really ruminating or anxiety stricken try saying \"In all likelihood, it really could happen.\" It helps you to acknowledge that there is always a chance of something happening but doesn't mean it necessarily will.Do you take any medication? It might be worth talking to your doctor about. It doesn't have to be for forever and can help you work through this trying time in your life."

I say no and he continues why not. I try yo dismiss him but then he asks me what about adoption and say no. So the interrogation continues and he says don't you like children. At this time i said why are you judging me. What have i done to you. Im furious. Then he says not everyone can be dads. I have been struggling with depression lately and feel i dont fit in. Not sure on all the rules here. Felt i needed to vent.I dont understand my work colleagues who i show respect and kindness and they treat me like an insect and squash me untill im hurt."

You are much nicer than me as I would have told him to mind his business the minute he started his interrogation.I'm 42 and am constantly judge by my extended family for not being married and having no kids. It used to bother me alot, but now I don't give crap. The ironic thing is most of my relatives, judging me, had or  are in bad relationships. Some don't even have a good relationship with their kids.  It's incredibly rude to ask 'why don't you have kids' as some people are not able to or just don't want kids. Whatever the reason, it's no one's business.I suspect that your coworker is probably miserable with his own life as most judgmental people are. If they were so happy with their live, they wouldn't interrogate or be care so much about someone else's.Just ignore your coworkers and shut them down if they bother you.Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 10/4/2019 6:56:09 PM (GMT-6)"

                "comment": "Hello Beagleman:Sorry, that you are going through this.  It's totally uncalled for.  As mentioned, it's none of his business what you do in your life.Some people are plain \"idiots\".  They like bullying people to make themselves feel better and bigger.  They especially like to bother the kind and quiet people.  Perhaps he is having home or other problems and taking his frustrations out on other people.  Maybe he's jealous of you for some reason.  I'm guessing, he was like this in school.There are millions of people who are unmarried without kids who are quite happy with their lives.  Others, who can't find their soulmate.  Even some who marry their soulmates get divorced.   I've read that a lot of the Millennials have no desire to get married after seeing so many other people getting divorced, including parents and aunts/uncles.  Some want to dedicate their lives to their jobs, some hoping they will build up their finances, so they can enjoy their retirement of traveling, etc.Maybe you should look for one or two of his weak spots.  Then when he bugs you again, you could throw that in his face.  Of course, that would be a last resort, especially if you think he is a better fighter. My Hubby mentioned that one because he was bullied in school and at work a few times, since he was only 126 lbs. during those times.  Then he took martial arts classes and built his muscles up since he figured something was going to come up again at some point.  Sure enough it did several times and he dealt with it both physically twice and verbally.  He made a fool out of the other guys.  My Hubby is a kind, smart but quiet Guy(he's not quiet with me   ).  No one better push his button or he'll figure out a way to put the abuser out.Of course, going to HR with your complaint would be the first choice since bullying is supposed to be 0 tolerance at school and work.  If a person is being harrassed then neither party is able to do their job properly.Do you get councelling or a therapist?  That is helpful too, if you get  a good one.You are definitely not alone  by a long shot.  Good Luck getting rid of the .........!!Post Edited (msOuchie) : 10/4/2019 7:21:32 PM (GMT-6)"

When my father died, it sent me into a deep depression right in the middle of a very stressful time in my schooling.  I didn't come out of that for a couple of years.  I think underlying depression can make things worse.  But I did come out of it.  I'm not over it, and I still cry about it sometimes, but I did stop thinking about his death and my loss all the time and remembered more of the good times and fun we had.  My father died 35 years ago this week.  I am trying to say, but not very well I'm afraid, that you WILL feel better, but I don't know when.  You will always miss your son.  It just gets to be less of a constant thing.  And when you do have times that you are not thinking about him, it doesn't mean that you are abandoning him or love him any less.Double Depression (dysthymia with intermittent MDD), Pre-diabetes, osteoarthritis both hips with replacements 3/1/2017 and 1/8/2019"

                "comment": "Weary I am sorry for your pain, I can not imgaine jt.I met a Mom that had 3 children and lost 2, one in their teens and one at 28.   She had started therapy but it was making her worse, so she stopped.  Before she left at the last session the therapist asked her to try one thing and to text him in 3 months to let him know how she was.  She agreed to this.The one thing was, to get a book, journal, anything, composition book,  and write to her children,  she could even have 2 separate books for each child.  She decided on 1 because they had a good relationship.  She said it was hard at first,  anger came out, grief was hard, crying as she wrote.  However, this was cathartic and she arrived at a place where she started to share here feelings with them.  Her love, memories, hopes and dreams that would not come to be.And late in the third month, she was writing to them everyday, letting them now, what the family and her were doing.When she talked to her therapist she agreed to see him once a month.  within 2 years she was writing only occasionally.  She realized that unconsciously she was letting go.  She then had therapy on an on call basis. I was memorized by this lady, we both have devastating histories,  but I think her joy and loss, then rebound slowly back into the presence is beyond what I could do.   She sad no,  it was not any different than what my journaling does for me.So weary,  I urge you to try this.  Or ask your doctor about this.  I can't remember, if you are in therapy if you are ask about it.

Some people can't be reasoned with.So if a person with mental illness is given good and positive advice by a therapist, and he or she is too depressed to believe it, does that mean the advice didn't help the individual?Not necessarily. Sometimes a person isn't helped at first because he/she doesn't believe the advice.  However, over time, the person may come to believe it.  It may take weeks, months, or even years. But over time, the therapist can make a difference in the life of the person with helpful advice.It's often a slow process.  However, over time, the good advice can get through to those battling mental illness.  It just takes time."

                "comment": "I am currently in therapy. I have crps which has done a number not only on my body but also my mental health as well. Before I had crps I was a well rounded competent individual with the memory of an elephant...I have had ptsd for awhile but now I have sever depression to the point I actually tried to kill myself by slitting my wrist and taking over 15 30mg percocet... my body threw up the percocet on it's own and now i have 10 stitches in my wrist. I have never tried to commit suicide before crps. I now have split personality disorder, depression, bipolar polar, generalized anxiety disorder, paranoia,  my short term memory is totally gone and I struggle every day on whether to keep living... with my therapist she actually listens to what I say and most of the time I come up with my own answers and she helps try to find a reason to keep living. Everyone is different and every therapist is different. You can see 100 different therapists and they will each have their own way of handling your particular situation.  Now as other people have said there a some people in this world that cant get help because when they are getting help they still dont feel as if they are so they refuse the help. Now when I first started going to therapy I was a person who went only because my family begged me to get help. I didnt believe in therapy and figured there was noone out there that can relate to me so when I first started going I turned deaf ears on my therapist and we actually sat there for 5 sessions and barely said anything because I refused to talk... she said something's to me then that while in the moment i could have cared less but over time i started thinking about what she was telling me and now we are talking to each other and i actually listen to what she says...sometimes i still dont get everything she says but it doesnt mean it doesnt help. So i guess to answer the actual question... even if it doesnt seem to help immediately it doesnt mean that it doesnt help in the end..now if a person is going to commit suicide they will find a way and do it no matter what but that one sentance may...just may be what saves that person's life down the road. So remember...you dont know what the next person is dealing with...be kind to others as you never know...that act of kindness may just be the reason that person doesnt kill him/herself or someone else. We all struggle with stuff but you never know what can help someone else.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 10/16/2019 4:19:39 AM (GMT-6)"

Today I did the real thing, using headphones with alternating beeps instead of eye movement.  We are working through the issue of shame, which is pervasive in my life.  We went back all the way to an incident n school when I was 7.  Interestingly enough, it makes me feel kind of ashamed to do this because I don't have what I would consider PTSD.  I have been very fortunate in my life not to have suffered any trauma and sometimes this makes me feel like I am just faking being depressed.  Anyway, I kinda went off topic.

My therapist told me to imagine somewhere I could put all the negative thoughts and feelings and I pictured a big wall of clear plastic totes, like at the Container Store.  But today I kept needing a bigger and bigger container.  It made me think of the Boggarts from Harry Potter.  They are creatures that represent one's worst fears and hide in closets.

It started with not sleeping through the night which is unusual for me and then the frequent crying came back. A few days ago I was listening to a podcast that unexpectedly got into a lot of existential stuff related to meditating that previously wouldn\u2019t have bothered me and I may have found it interesting but since about a year ago I can\u2019t listen to it. I had to shut it off half way through because it made me feel totally detached, feeling of dread and not like myself and I feel like I\u2019ve gone totally backwards. I\u2019m trying to pull out any tools I can think of to ground myself, doing lots of art and keeping as busy as possible but it does get me freightened that this is happening and is making it hard to enjoy things because I feel somewhat separated from it.

I mean sort of in the sense that something within the process has instigated a mind response and thus it's safety mechanism has been tripped.Fear not....breathe through it. I am safe or a mantra of the same effect. This type of situations are common, and it doesn't always pertsin to unresolved issues....the ill informed always believe so.We we get into a funk via something that you are experiencing or for no reason our mind is more susceptible to emotive and sensitivities and triggers than when we are more stable.Your tool box...good on ya. The reason this is happening can be something your mind may see as a trigger...it could be just benign it may have relevance but if it does not then correct your mind. Mantra.Keep \ud83d\udcaa....our minds play havoc with us and sometimes we got to correct it. It will pass. Your sharing shows your strength and therefore with support will combat it.HT"

Like they mentioned, it sounds like something triggered you. I think one of the things that has helped me lately is just being aware of what's happening. The last time around I thought I was actually losing it. But now I know it's how my mind responds to stress or a trigger. I have an app called Smiling Mind that I use at night sometimes to help me get to sleep. There are many different guided meditations, but I typically always use the sleep one.I wish you well!"

Bad, very bad thoughts, depression, what's the point etc..But though experience my logical brain knew this would pass.  YES, it is hard to hold on to that, but I found since I journal,  tagging pages in my journals and going back to read the times I came through depressive episodes helps a lot. Also. write what I feel and how I feel about the situation.  Not holding back anything,  gets a lot of that emotion out.  Do not know if that would help you,  just saying.Hope you feel better soon.

                "comment": "Hello Everyone!Today I had such a postive experience from a mild dissociative episode on Friday10/25/19.For near 3 weeks, I have been waking up and think to myself, \"1 more day alone\" I have no family and my husband left me last year.Knowing isolating only makes things worse, I forced, myself to to a local book sale. I had 2 boxes of donations for them tooI bought 2 large bag of books, however I wrote in my journal the experience was not fun and did not find anything speacial.Today 10/27/19, I went through the books.20 in all. 7 large prints that were free, I sell them on ebay.The other 13 were special in their own way6 of them date from 1836 - 1921 I adore antique books!So, amazingly, even though I felt on auto pilot, I was actually looking for things I liked. I believe I turned my emotions to numb. I know I dissociated because it is a bit foggy, except for driving home.What I take away from this is, once I decide to get out and challenge the urge to isolate; using mindfulness may not be necessary, although it would enhance the expierence. For me, mindfulness would make it easier the next time.We all forget skills, being in survival mode takes a lot of energy and beating ourselves up is not going to make anything better.So self-compassion and mindfulness together could help us challenge isolation.PeaceTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

                "comment": "Two years ago, a car struck me while I was crossing the road. I later learned that the driver of the vehicle had a suspended license and should not have been driving.I sustained a number of disc bulges and herniation in my neck and back due to the accident and had to undergo chiropractic treatment,  physical therapy and other medical treatment for one year. Although the treatments helped somewhat, I still experience intense back and neck pain; it is so bad sometimes that it hurts to move or lie down.  The accident has greatly impacted my life, and I can no longer due the exercises that I used to due. It has also caused me additional expense because I have to pay for chiropractic treatment as I have no health insurance.I got angry today due to my back pain. It literally feels like my back is going to fall apart.My mom and another person told me that I need to forgive the driver, not for his sake but for mine, but I wonder how true this is. Do you really need to forgive someone to move on? I don't think so. Yes, I still get angry at the driver sometimes, but I have accepted my new reality and 'moved on' as I really have no choice. Forgiveness can be a great release for some people and help them to move on with their lives. However, for other people, forgiveness is not necessary for healing.  I have told my mom and another person this, but they say I am wrong.  Telling someone that they need to forgive can be more detrimental for some people IMO. Thanks for listening to my rant."

                "comment": "FPI am truly sad that you had to be injured.  Unresponsible people anger me.  I had years of abuse from my family during childhood.  2011, suppressed memories popped.What I have learned in therapy are the following, I hope some of it helps you.  None of us experience things the same way, the bright spot is the actions we take to heal, effect us differently as we are individuals. Learned to be aware of my emotions, what I was feeling.  It took some time, body scans helped a lot.  My c1-c6 are bulging.  realizing my muscles were tight, I learned to focus on them and relax them.then I could see the emotion of fear, anger, rage, unfairness etc...I did all the anger stuff, writing the letters never to be mailed, talking yelling to the empty chair,  never really work for me,  I would always end up laughing.  It was just a chair.I thing I worked on that difficult to accept,  I did not create my physical and emotional havoc/disability.  The pain I have, I did not ask for, 2 people that helped give to me were dead, how can possibly get past this!! No matter what the situation,  a person has to realize their situation was not asked for, not their fault.  However, it is here, and if the person wants to heal, they have to own it.  This is my pain, my injury,  what can I do to heal.Once that is said in your heart,  you become your own advocate.  It take strength more than you realize you have.  Never give up looking for a doc to help. Never, never give up.   about 3 years after disclosure of the abuse, and my family shunning me. I realized I didn't have so much anger anymore as I did sorrow for them.  They were more angry that I was.  They knew what happened, shout denial to heavens.  Scared their Camelot lives would be shattered. Even to day,  When I sit in stillness, I find peace.  I have no anger towards them.  I can not say that I forgive them,  it may not be for me to do that.  It is enough I harbor not ill will, anger or rage.  They are out of my life, I have let go of my past and moved on. I believe forgiveness is different for each person.  Maybe when that person is no longer renting space in your head, that will be it for you.I wish you Peace, comfort and strengthTrinaModerator - Depression \"...when the gift of sight is cause enough for jubilation.\"          Billy Collins from the poem.

Well, it only snowed for the last 13 miles.  Go figure.  I didn't do much in Utah because I was so tired.  I took two naps yesterday and still went to bed at 10 pm and woke up at 8:30.

I spent the night in town last night because going home and coming back would have been something like 5 hours total.  And then the office closed down early today so that we could all get home before the next wave of snow came.  The snow doesn't bother me, as long as it's not windy, but spending so much time in the car gets old.  Bought diapers for my mother in law and potty pads for the dog on the way home today.

I went in took a shower and made myself some tea.  I know he only came because his, whatever, cancelled.  But at least I didn't have to do it all.Red,  I know how you feel!  My past makes this hard for me.  I was joining a local meet up book club.   The yesterday someone, posted a nasty comment [sexual], still there this morning.  So the admin/MOD of the meetup is not even watching the site.  Adults right?Well rationally, sure, it would be safe to still attend.  However, my mind is NO NO NO!  I am not going to make my self go somewhere I am fearful of for any reason.   I force myself to get out enough as it is.  Hard to make friends,  for me it is a slow process.

Don't follow it or any team,  I enjoy the game, the plays etc.... Most days I have force myself to do things, but once I get going I feel better.  We deserve more than we feel,  I practice self-compassion and mindfulness.I honestly would not know where I would be without these skills in my daily life.

I have been listening to mercy street- I like the idea of mercy.  Giving and receiving. I know that's not what the song is really about but we can take what we need from it, right? So interesting that you start to feel better when you smile and laugh. How long does the feeling last?Buena - flipping the switch- I like it, very visual and almost automated. When you switch off do you immediately go back to depression or is it more of feeling you can be yourself again? That is horrible about your evaluation- sounds very unfair. Sorry to hear that. Bnotafraid- I'm glad you're feeling better coming off from months of struggle- good for you! Kids can be so entertaining- and wise beyond their years sometimes. It's always nice to see them before they've been  brought down by society's conforming structure. Hope there's still some ball games for you to watch.

Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener."

But just because you feel your problems are far less serious than others doesn't mean it doesn't count.  They are your issues and are very important to you.  So remember that.  I imagine that the group therapy is interesting.  I have never done group, but some others here have.  Some people thrive in that kind of setting.  I don't think I have enough confidence.  I don't know why.  I don't do good around large groups of people.I am glad you are reaching out here.  It has been kind of slow.  But the administration is working on making it better so more people can join.I hope you have a good day today.Hugs, Karen...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies"

We are now 10 in the group, so it is probably the most we should have to maintain a certain amount of control by the moderator.Once more this week there were a few people who were using up most of the two hour time.  I thought  we would be sharing our experiences and our various ways of dealing with our demons.It was uplifting though, as depression has many facets and they all come out.   There are still a few who are shy about discussing their personal problems.  I did find a more relaxed atmosphere in the room.Each week we are given assignments. Small things we can do to cope.  This week we are going to keep a rough agenda of our activities on a daily basis.  We will review next week.So far, so good."

The real advantage to this process is to interact with others.  You don't usually have intimate contact with others suffering  from Depression.

It has alway been that way for me.  The saving factor with this type of sickness is that I know I will get better.I have to  admit the periods of relative freedom from depression come less often.

Moderator had complete control finally made possible by everyone being mostly quiet and attentive.We were put in groups of two people and discussed our \"support people\"  In other words the ones that understood and helped us on a daily basis.Among those helping were our significant mates, our Doctors, pharmacists, and in most cases our dogs, or cats.Everyone made reference how our animals can help.  They listen, they don't interfere, they are not judgemental, and they ask little in return.We decided that there are many who don't understand Depression and probably never will.  Who knows why ?"

                "comment": "Hi Cloudy, Welcome to the forum!That is the thing with support groups.  The moderators/facilitators are the same as the members.  They have their stuff too.  Bad days good days. If they are having a bad day, it is all they can do to stay present, let alone see that someone is in stress.  Also, when a member is new, they are in stress, anxiety this is normal and most groups, let them work it out themselves. The thought behind this is, besides the welcomes, the person needs to find the strength themselves to attend.I was a facilitator for 3 years, then I was working on some bad stuff from my past and I stepped down.

This Thursday it will be the fifth week of the ten week gathering of the group exercise.  You are right about the personal problems that our moderator had, until we gave her some positive encouragement.  The individuals in the group tend to concentrate on their own state of health which is understandable.  It is interesting to watch people relax more and take part in our helping each other.In general, it is a rewarding two  hours a week which is bearing fruit.  By your post you seem to have much experience.  We all benefit from your past involvement on this site.You do fine work.

                "comment": "cloudy said...HiFolks.It has been a few years since I put anything forward on the Depression site,  but I have had Depression  during all this time.My depression comes and goes with no real regularity.  Right now I am having one of my episodes.  My psychiatrist has me going on a 10 week (2hours per wk) therapy group effort.  There are 2 men and 8 women taking part.  Ages from 81 down to 21.  I am 77.Have done the first week which consisted of each one of us telling our life stories.  I have learned that my problems are far less serious than most others.  We have vowed to help each other, and I am looking for a positive experience.  I am getting the feeling that my input will be considerable as I like to talk.  I must be attentive to everyone and become a good listener.I would have the same problem, being attentive to everyone else and being a good listener.  I tend to be an impatient person, and while I can easily be empathetic with the struggles of someone else, I'm afraid my impatience would come through.  It is eye opening, though, isn't it, that perspective you gain when getting out amongst other people and discovering that many people are at least as sad as you are, and some are much worse, with good reason.  I often feel like my sadness is something that doesn't make sense and wonder if I am MAKING myself sad for a reason.  Many people have so much more to deal with than I do.  Keep us posted on how this group therapy works out for you, please.Denise"

You have outlined, with some precision, my shared attitude that much of my depression (sadness) comes from some unknown regions of my crowded and muddled mind.  I have been giving much thought to my parents.  Were one or both of them subject to Depression?I thought back to what I remembered as the periods in their lives that would produce traumatic experiences and I have come to realize that there were family problems. ( Lack  of sufficient money to raise a family, social and otherproblems brought about by marriage )  These facts were overcome by time and more family prosperity, but none the less I think the damage had already been done.  Particularly in my father's case.As a young adult, thinking that I knew much more than proved to be the case, I never got to have heart to heart discussions with him.  He passed away when I was 24.  As I deal with my personal depression, I have been enlightened to some degree with this group effort.     Finding it therapeutic"

                "comment": "I'm sorry that you missed the opportunity for a heart-to-heart with your father.  That's enough to make anyone sad for lost opportunities, doesn't it.  I often wonder how my life might have been much different if my father had not died at age 33, when I was six.  He  called me his \"Little Miss America,\" which became \"Missy,\" which morphed into \"Mitzi\" which morphed into simply Mitz.  What I wouldn't give to have him take me into his arms and feel and believe me worthy of that unconditional acceptance and love.  What you wouldn't give to sit down and have the heart to heart  with your father.  The longing is killer sometimes, isn't it.I have no doubt my mother loves me, but I just don't feel like she likes me very much.  And that may be valid and it may not be, that belief.  In some ways, I feel it's really unfair of me.  She and I are about as different as two people can be and yet we are mother and daughter and share some parts of our personalities in common.I first got depressed when a 5+ year relationship fell apart when I had just turned 30.  We spent one last Christmas together with my family in the home we once shared on Christmas Eve, although we slept in different bedrooms.  On Christmas morning, my mother, who was visiting from Texas, my ex-boyfriend and I went to mass.  And I cried through just about the entire mass until I felt I just had to leave the church.  I cried for that little girl that I was 24 years earlier, and I saw her sitting alone and missing her Daddy, and now having another man leave her.  I felt great empathy and heartbreak for that little girl, who felt so very alone and sad.  I wish I could have one memory of my father.  I don't remember him at all.  I went to Kindergarten the next day and for show and tell, I said, \"My Daddy died last night.\"  I wish I could get a hug that I BELIEVED was unconditional acceptance and love for me.  I wish I had not completely given up on love 32 years ago because of the fear that I would not survive another loss.  What a waste of a life to let fear control you and convince you to give up.I don't know what I believe about a Heaven or Hell, any kind of afterlife.  I always say 12 years of Catholic education cured me of Catholicism.  I am not a religious person.  But wouldn't it be so sweet if it were possible that I could get that hug I so desperately needed/need and want and you could have that heart to heart talk with your father.Post Edited (MitzMN) : 10/22/2018 5:33:04 PM (GMT-6)"

                "comment": "We all have our life stories.  I am in my late 70's and I too have suffered periods of my upbringing and later times more dramatic and full of stress that I have overcome.  We all would do things and think things out differently if we could turn back the clock.People who tell you they \"would not change a thing\" are not being truthful.  There are always regrets over lost opportunities, lost loves, lost friends and any number of situations.  In my case I have lost close friends for reasons I can't explain.  This  in particular has happened  with what I considered 3 times in my life.  In each case these people are still alive although they live in different areas of the country.  The fact that they have all had great financial success  must be a factor.  Monetary wealth seems to cause a breakdown in shared interests and the ability to share experiences.  Although I am not poor and struggling, I don't regret being lower on the social scene.With the group therapy exercise I am presently involved in, the other people who suffer with depression also have very diverse backgrounds and an endless stream of problems, both real and perceived.  Lives that have been shattered by deaths, loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and other mental problems.I don't know your personal present situation.  I hope you have someone close.  My wife is my savior.  She has learned to understand depression and how to react to my occasional outbursts of tears and depressed thoughts.  I don't profess to be religious, but I envy those who find all the answers through total dedication to a supreme being.That's enough rambling on for now.     Everybody hurts sometime."

Everyone else has trouble sleeping without   aid of medication.  It would be interesting to know the percentage of depressed people who suffer from insomnia.  I am sure that there are stats on the subject.With the darkness hours increasing, we discussed procuring \"Sun Lamps\".  apparently they help if you have one near you in the dark.  My knowledge of these is nil.   Will someone please enlighten me?Another topic we approached is commitment to get back to things we enjoy doing but have lost interest in, or the energy to take part in  because of  our depression.

For example  \"Emotional reasoning\", jumping to conclusions without knowing what a situation entails.   When depressed we think immediately a negative answer to any possibility of a stated fact that involves decision making.The real way to look at things is to weigh the possible negative or positive answers and come to the right conclusion.That was just an example of \"filtering\" our thoughts.We had a breakdown of one of our people today.  The person has a very complicated life, and some emotions became too much to deal with and required an early exit from our meeting.  This caused a sad reaction from the rest of us, as we felt unable to help.  We thought maybe a hug was in order, but it was rejected. We still feel we are being helped.  There is no chance of us not getting to the 10 week completion.  Some are wishing we could make it last longer."

Not to give them more negative thought than they deserved.   The leader gave us a list relaxation techniques  to reduce anxiety and stress.The friendship of the group continues to grow."

My dog passed away on May 15 this year.  She had a heart attack.  Truly wasn't expected.  It has been a little lonely without her.  When I was a kid, we always had a cat.  So I don't mind them.  They keep the rodents down.  One of the cats brought us a dead mouse as a thank you for the food I think.  It was in front of the door one morning.  The mouse, not the cat.  Ha...  I love big cats.  I like to paint pictures of them.  I love their eyes.  I started a clouded leopard a few years ago and haven't finished it.  One day I will.  I hope you have a good rest of the day.  We are going to go to a wedding reception later on.  I am going for the food.  LOL...  I don't know the people that well but my husband does.  It should be fun.Take care Ian...Hugs...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)"

                "comment": "Hi there       9th session of 10We talked  in some detail about going back to work after somewhat long periods of time off for treatment of Depression. This did not apply in some cases as we are retired.  However, it applies to us if we are involved in work  as volunteers or general community contributions.Two of the group are going back part time and they are finding it difficult as they have been on Sick Leave for many months. They are back part time to start with and they both admitted to being very tired after a day'swork.   Some co-workers  understand and some are less supportive.  It depends entirely on the environment and the sort of work you are returning to.Insurance companies are of course in favor of a full return and the shortest possible time of readaptation.  In today's high pressure employment atmosphere, there may be little sympathy for your illness.  Once again itis the stigma of mental illness that rears it's ugly head.  Money affects everything and has no patience withthe affected, so getting back in the saddle is what they want.   Easier said than done.Back problems or sickness of a more physical nature is much easier for most people to understand.  The type of employment comes into effect as well.  If  it is a large organization or a public or government institution they can change work tasks to help with gradual  reentry.  Smaller work places may find this difficult.In any case the return to work is a challenge.   The session we had was called  \"Harmonizing With Your Work Environment\"Next week is our last.  We will review  and decide how we have been helped  as individuals.  I think it has been anoverall positive exercise .  Some weeks and topics have been more interesting than others.   This is just an example of personalities picking and choosing which topics most applied to them."

But all in all it was good.It is sad about the stigma of depression.  People who don't have it just don't understand what others are going though.  I hope some day that will change.  And yes going back to work after being off for a length of time is hard.  It would be nice if a person could go back slowly.  But that just isn't the way things are.I hope you stick with us Ian even after the group therapy.  I enjoy reading your posts.  You seem very insightful.I am not feeling too good today.  I got a flu shot but still got something.  Maybe it is a cold but it has settled in my chest.  So this post will be a little short because I think I am going back to bed.I hope you have a good evening and a good Thanksgiving.Hugs, Karen...Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)"

                "comment": "Group session number 10 (final week)Where to start with this subject?    Well it went about the way I expected.  There were various conclusions as you would expect.  The general feeling is that the interaction among all present was mostly enjoyed in that we all had gained something because everyone was suffering from the same thing.  Before each get together we would greet each other with \"how was your week?\".  In general the responses were some good days and some bad.With the exception of one or two people who did not enjoy the efforts of our moderator, the exercise was deemed a success.  We had all filled out a list of answers to general questions in our first meeting.  We answered the same questions at the last and checked to see if our outlook had changed over the 10 week period.  There had been someimprovements.The next step is to have a one on one meeting with the therapist to document and evaluate our experience andget some feedback  in order help us to work on things more specifically as individuals.I should mention that there was an incident which happened during the meeting. A person in an connecting roomwas screaming loudly and had to be removed by security.  This had an effect on our group, as it was of course frightening.   One must admit that in a department treating all levels of mental illness you could expect the oddproblem.I should say again that we were provided with much useful material and web sites selected by the  departmentthat will remain useful to us."

Being with others that share the same sickness is beneficial, as one does not often get a chance to interact with      them and gain the trust in sharing episodes of ups and downs of our daily lives.2.  The organized and carefully planned subjects given from week to week, and with times to reflect on our       experiences helped a great deal.3.  in general it was a worth the effort and most of the group has had a positive attitude and would like to look     into further  classes."

It amounted to rehashing some of the things that were discussed during the course we followed, and an update since we had not seen each other for about 7  weeks.One of our group was admitted to hospital during the Christmas vacation period.  He spent about a week and according to him, it did no good.   He felt isolated knowing that it was not easy to leave the unit even if he wanted to. I can relate to that as my psychiatrist has an office near the entrance of the inpatient unit. I have often thought how it is important that I stay well enough not to visit this place.All in all, we still think our therapy sessions was beneficial to most of us.  Those who did not share this feeling did not last the 10 weeks.  We will meet again in February."

For myself, I found it was not enough time to have conversations among the 8 people taking part.  We meet again in 2 weeks.

I am going to get my hair done and other than yesterday at the endo's office it will be the first I have left the house in a week.  So I am looking forward to getting out.

I do think, however, that this friendship isn't worth it if this person stop talking to you over an unintentional mistake . It sounds a bit immature to blow off someone over something insignificant. Is it possible that something else is going on in this person's life which has nothing to do with you?You should go to the harvest festival and sell your paintings. Interacting with people might cheer you up. You might develop new friendship with people you meet there Enjoy your life and have a bit of fun. Forget about John, his family, and girlfriend. Don't let them take up any more space in your mind. They aren't worth thinking about Put them out of your mind and heart. Their enjoying their lives, so you do the same.I was in a bad relationship once. I was so upset and angry and constantly thought about that person. My therapist then told me something I never forgot. She said \"...the best revenge is to live your life and forget about them\". You should do the same. Who knows...you may meet someone worthy of your thoughts and affection.And your not alone, you got your online family and friends here. I know the holidays can be tough, but try to remember that it's just one day. Maybe you can volunteer somewhere on the holidays. A soup kitchen perhaps...helping other people might also ease your pain."

He can probably do your blood work too.  Did you know there is a new gadget that can do your HbA1c right in the office, like a glucometer?

Well, I lead a VERY low-risk life - exposure to the flu would be quite unlikely.  And I have an auto-immune disease, and these things make responses to vaccines a bit unpredictable.  Should my life circumstances change, and I were to become much more social and be around children or others that are likely to be carriers... of course I'd get a flu shot.I believe in dancing the fine line between being Prudent and being Paranoid. lol"

The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt.  first night at book club tomorrow at 7pm.  I will bravely attend on my own.  Need to change my actions to change my isolation.   Hard stuff!!I was in Wash D.C. for the 1976 bicentennial also!  Graduated in 79.  I loved winter,  was always outside,   well I was outside all year round, so winter does not really count. I made to the Harvest Fest.  Stayed off my feet, except for caring for the dogs, until Friday night. Sold 3 paintings and some book marks.  Well done, considering the crowd was 1/2 of what was expected. Thing is you never know who will buy what,  size of crowd does not really matter. I was wrecked on Sunday,  physical limitations were pushed on a 14 hour day.  Slept most of the day Sunday. Speaking of burgers,  I think I will go to a place named the Pour House, best burgers around here.  I don't eat meat much,  but when I do, I go there. Peace all.

So I make the appointments, take her to doctor's appointments, go in with her so I can hear what the plan is, go to the pharmacy .  We are working with primary care, dentist and orthopedics right now so it gets busy. Her daughter won't have anything to do with her and I don't know why.  My husband is perfectly happy shirking his responsibility and since he's not living here it's easy for him to do.  I'm not particularly attached to her, but I'm not going to be the one who puts her out on the street.  It's just her and I living here right now.

Somethings it is tough to get my head into skill mode, especially when I wake up in a panic stake,  somehow I manage to take an Ativan, I keep at bedside.

                "comment": "Hi everyone, After going through serotonin syndrome from the increase of my previous antidepressant (Luvox), I was switched to Cymbalta. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder recently and have had issues with finding the right antidepressant. I'm starting to have some side effects and would like to know when they'll ease off. I'm getting a bit anxious and restless to the point of wanting to do something but can't keep my mind on said action. Is that normal? And I'm starting to have some issues sleeping. I've been on Cipralex with good success and wanted to be switched to that after I got off Luvox, but my family doctor switched me to Cymbalta.

                "comment": "Hi Sibby,Welcome to the depression forum.  I don't think I have seen you here before.  I have never taken Cymbalta, but was curious as to how long you been on it and when the side effects started.  Generally side effects go away in a week to ten days.  Some stay with you though.  I started Lexapro a couple of months ago and recently noticed constipation.  I have gained five pounds from it.  If I don't gain anymore I will still be happy but if it gets worse, I think I will ask about another med.  I would give the medication a chance, say six to eight weeks while you wait for it to get to it's full potential.  Then you should know whether or not you want to stay on it.I hope that it works well for you.  If you are feeling better mentally and emotionally that is a good sign.Hang in there.Hugs, Karen...PS  Sorry about the serotonin syndrome.  That must of been awful.Oh and just curious, I take abilify, was wondering why you take yours at night.  It probably doesn't matter.Moderator-Depression  fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue, depression, allergies, diabetes (type 2)"

I hope your side effects will go away soon!I've been on it for a week, and they started in the last 4-5 days. I've just phoned pharmacist to see why I was agitated and so restless. Apparently, there's a moderate interaction between it and my Doxepin, and I need to get off of Cymbalta and go on Cipralex. Surprisingly, I was doing better and feeling myself on it until the restlessness hit me.It was one of the worse experiences I've ever had. But I'm glad I'm not there.I was on Abilify in the morning, but I kept getting tired during the day, so I was told to switch at night, if that helps."

It does not release higher levels at lower dosages, it's simply a lower dose that crosses the blood brain barrier and is therefore more effective at extremely low doses with no side effects.  It's available OTC because no reports of major side effects.  It's actually an amazing mineral that we are all probably deficient in and need for balance.  I've never seen anything with better reviews.  Especially compared with other mood altering drugs with known crippling side effects.  Low dose lithium orotate is equivalent to amounts found in drinking water in some places or in vegetables grown in lithium rich soil.   It's nueroprotectant, regenerative and mood stabilizing ability is incredible!  Anyone with suicidal thoughts or PTSD must absolutely try this.  For the rest of us it's great to help manage stress.  It can be used as needed and can quit anytime without tapering.  The trick to it is \"low doses\".  (120 mg = 5mg elemental lithium)  Effective at just 5mg a day, wouldn't take more than 30mg)  :O)Post Edited (HJQuinn) : 9/28/2019 3:01:40 PM (GMT-6)"

I take one in the a.m. and one in the p.m.  It seems to actually be helping my digestion as well because of leveling out stress in my body.  It's really nice.  Sleeping much better too.  Oh be careful though because it raises Serotonin levels so if you are transitioning from an SSRI drug to this your Serotonin levels could get too high.  It may seem like a side effect but it is just the SSRI is still in your system.   Once it levels out, there should be no side effects."

My doctor told me it woul be 4-6 weeks, but this could be different for different meeds and different people. The feeling you get initally (Where you feel great) could simply be expectation. You have something that you have been told will make you better and because you expect it to, it does but the feeling only lasts for a short period of time so potentially, this is what you are describing. As for treatment, I believe that meds are simply a coping mechanism for depression. For some people it allows them to cope to the point where they feel they are able to deal with the root cause by themselves (Hence, the drug can be seem as the 'cure') but for others, they need that little bit of extra help in the form of 'talking medicine' (I cant remember where I heard that phrase but I think its great!   \u00a0 If you are resistant to meds then I would definately look into talking medicine either in the form of self-help or professional counselling. \nI hope this helps\nDarrenEveryone has a guardian angel.

For some people it allows them to cope to the point where they feel they are able to deal with the root cause by themselves\nDarren, you are correct in the fact that antidepressant normally take 4-6 weeks to reach their effective level in a persons body.\u00a0 This always does depend on the person though.\u00a0 I would however disagree that medication (antidepressants) are a coping mechanism for depression.\u00a0 Depression in a lot of people is a chemical inbalance of serotinin in their brain...this is an actual medical condition and cannot be helped.\u00a0 Antidepressants restore the levels of serotinin, which is not something that a person with depression can just do on there own.\u00a0 Depression isnt something that we cause to ourselves.\u00a0 Here is a link from the National Institute of Mental Health on Depression so maybe you can become more knowledgeable on this subject.\u00a0 http://www.nimh.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Depressionmenu.cfm\nElishaCo~Mod: DepressionModerator: Heart & Cardiovascular Diseasehttps://www.healingwell.com/donate"

When I told her that my dating life is non-existent, and I just don't care if I'm with someone or not, she gave me a vibe like 'poor you'. I seem to get this a lot when people, especially extended family, learn that I am 42 years old, no kids, and not married or dating.I really don't understand why many people think that being married/in a relationship is the end all be all for a person. What irks me the most is that most of these people are in horrible relationships.I haven't been in a relationship for years. And to be totally honest, I really have no desire to be in one. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm asexual. I mostly like being by myself although I do wish for companionship at times. I use to tell people that I want to be marry and have kids, but I now realize I was repeating what my family expected of me. I realize, through therapy, that it's okay to be single. I also think living in a big city, as opposed to a rural or small community, helps as there are a lot of people in the same boat.I just wish people didn't pity or think me abnormal for not being married or having kids."

                "comment": "Same boat here -- very familiar to me. There seems to be a stigma associated with not being married or having kids, particularly when you get into middle age. By now, most of my peers have at least teenage or college-age kids, often bringing up their family lives in small talk. All those experiences are foreign to me, and all I can do is nod politely as they happily and proudly talk about their daughter's piano talent, son's vacation escapades, getting into some great college, etc.There's definitely been pressure from family, even if not in so many words. They seem to have stopped asking about my relationships/wife only recently, perhaps realizing it likely won't happen. I have no siblings with children, and the family line will die off with me. This may be the biggest part of the pressure, which may have gotten to me -- i.e., I was made to feel as though I'm letting them down, and in the worst way possible.Not really sure how to get past this -- some people emphasize how they couldn't imagine life without their SO, how their kids are their reason for living, etc. For those without, what else can substitute?Not that I was ever against marriage, kids, and the \"normal\" or \"expected\" life, but I simply never found anyone, or maybe something about me always ruined things. Many years ago, I was even on an \"incel\" forum, long before incel became a four-letter word. I never found solutions, even if I found others in the same situation. That forum is long gone, thanks to the \"new\" breed of violent, cynical incels out there. There doesn't even seem to be a replacement term for the \"old\" ones.SWMMDD+PDD"

The managers disclosed my demographic info (my living sitch) to all my co-workers and anyone who walks into the store. The privacy of my sitch is nill when they never talk about anyone elses living sitch. If you are not sure where the mean girls go after they leave high school and college, well they work at the mall for the rest of their lives.The other day the manager had her family in to visit, I walked out of the store and they stood their in the mall lobby to say \"that's her\" and started laughing. I reported them a few weeks into the job and it just got worse and worse. I can't believe that managers of a fortune 500 company could be so petty and immature. I live with a sibling and we had to take my mom in because she was recovering from a bad illness that almost killed her. When I told some of my nicer co-workers this, they understood because they were taking care of their parents as well. The petty Bees thought that \"that wasn't the reason for my living sitch.\"The reason for my post is I'm just baffled about how to deal with this mean girl mentality when it comes to adults that have no compassion or even hearts.Any thoughts?Sucks2bsickP.S. I forgot the most horrible part. For awhile the manager was trying to piss me off and get me to quit by saying stuff like \"I think she tried to kill herself and that's why she lives with her mother.\"FYI: I have never tried to kill myself."

However, when I was expressing to her about how I was feeling and what was bothering me in my life at the time, she would interrupt me too much and start giving me advice.It's impossible for a shrink to never interrupt you during therapy sessions.

Yes, I know that I shouldn't let my past experiences dictate my future, but it is so hard not to. (I'm working on this with my therapist).I also realize that I've been stuck in a rut  so long that I got comfortable being in it. I'm afraid of change which I realize is foolish as life is all about change, but I can't help how I feel. When I think about everything, I realize that 'fear' has been a constant factor in my life; it has paralyzed me. I have a fear of everything. My thoughts even tell me that something bad will happen to me if I do or don't do something. I know I shouldn't diagnose myself or turn to 'Dr. Google' for answers, but my behavior seems to fit the  definition of OCD. I'm trying hard to correct my mindset, but it is such a struggle."

I think just the fact that you KNOW your thoughts are irrational is huge. I just read something today that made sense to me. Whenever you're really ruminating or anxiety stricken try saying \"In all likelihood, it really could happen.\" It helps you to acknowledge that there is always a chance of something happening but doesn't mean it necessarily will.Do you take any medication? It might be worth talking to your doctor about. It doesn't have to be for forever and can help you work through this trying time in your life."

I say no and he continues why not. I try yo dismiss him but then he asks me what about adoption and say no. So the interrogation continues and he says don't you like children. At this time i said why are you judging me. What have i done to you. Im furious. Then he says not everyone can be dads. I have been struggling with depression lately and feel i dont fit in. Not sure on all the rules here. Felt i needed to vent.I dont understand my work colleagues who i show respect and kindness and they treat me like an insect and squash me untill im hurt."

You are much nicer than me as I would have told him to mind his business the minute he started his interrogation.I'm 42 and am constantly judge by my extended family for not being married and having no kids. It used to bother me alot, but now I don't give crap. The ironic thing is most of my relatives, judging me, had or  are in bad relationships. Some don't even have a good relationship with their kids.  It's incredibly rude to ask 'why don't you have kids' as some people are not able to or just don't want kids. Whatever the reason, it's no one's business.I suspect that your coworker is probably miserable with his own life as most judgmental people are. If they were so happy with their live, they wouldn't interrogate or be care so much about someone else's.Just ignore your coworkers and shut them down if they bother you.Post Edited (ForeverPositive) : 10/4/2019 6:56:09 PM (GMT-6)"

                "comment": "Hello Beagleman:Sorry, that you are going through this.  It's totally uncalled for.  As mentioned, it's none of his business what you do in your life.Some people are plain \"idiots\".  They like bullying people to make themselves feel better and bigger.  They especially like to bother the kind and quiet people.  Perhaps he is having home or other problems and taking his frustrations out on other people.  Maybe he's jealous of you for some reason.  I'm guessing, he was like this in school.There are millions of people who are unmarried without kids who are quite happy with their lives.  Others, who can't find their soulmate.  Even some who marry their soulmates get divorced.   I've read that a lot of the Millennials have no desire to get married after seeing so many other people getting divorced, including parents and aunts/uncles.  Some want to dedicate their lives to their jobs, some hoping they will build up their finances, so they can enjoy their retirement of traveling, etc.Maybe you should look for one or two of his weak spots.  Then when he bugs you again, you could throw that in his face.  Of course, that would be a last resort, especially if you think he is a better fighter. My Hubby mentioned that one because he was bullied in school and at work a few times, since he was only 126 lbs. during those times.  Then he took martial arts classes and built his muscles up since he figured something was going to come up again at some point.  Sure enough it did several times and he dealt with it both physically twice and verbally.  He made a fool out of the other guys.  My Hubby is a kind, smart but quiet Guy(he's not quiet with me   ).  No one better push his button or he'll figure out a way to put the abuser out.Of course, going to HR with your complaint would be the first choice since bullying is supposed to be 0 tolerance at school and work.  If a person is being harrassed then neither party is able to do their job properly.Do you get councelling or a therapist?  That is helpful too, if you get  a good one.You are definitely not alone  by a long shot.  Good Luck getting rid of the .........!!Post Edited (msOuchie) : 10/4/2019 7:21:32 PM (GMT-6)"

Latest was Wellbutrin, where they kept increasing the dose but still nothing changed. Then he wanted to do TMS,  but that seemed REALLY costly and nothing I read lead me to believe it would be all that helpful. (One of those Drs who had one of the TMS machines in house, thus thought it was the answer to all problems.)   I don't remember everything I've tried... Elavil, Zoloft for sure.

Effexor and Pristiq both worked well for me.  But I take additionally Abilify and Xanax.  Oh and newly added Lexapro.  Just a little though to add to the Pristiq because the insurance company wouldn't pay for what I needed of the Pristiq.  That is something the doc had the TMS machine at the house.  Kind of spooky.  But I could see where it would help people.I really do hope you find something that works.  HT (Turtle) said he started taking an amino acid that is helping him think more clearly and I think it helps mentally too.  He called it N-acetyl cysteine.  Or NAC.  He is in Australia.

And then she doesn't.Well I tried that but I think my son needed me. I kept getting signs like I rented one car but we got a Jeep which he drove. Waiter- his name. other things. Plus dreams of him every night we were there and I have had a hard time remembering dreams.I can't tell you how sad and how worn out my soul feels.I don't like to be the complainer- I know how tiresome it is to listen to someone who is always down.I just don't know when my spirits will lift if ever."

When my father died, it sent me into a deep depression right in the middle of a very stressful time in my schooling.  I didn't come out of that for a couple of years.  I think underlying depression can make things worse.  But I did come out of it.  I'm not over it, and I still cry about it sometimes, but I did stop thinking about his death and my loss all the time and remembered more of the good times and fun we had.  My father died 35 years ago this week.  I am trying to say, but not very well I'm afraid, that you WILL feel better, but I don't know when.  You will always miss your son.  It just gets to be less of a constant thing.

She had started therapy but it was making her worse, so she stopped.  Before she left at the last session the therapist asked her to try one thing and to text him in 3 months to let him know how she was.  She agreed to this.The one thing was, to get a book, journal, anything, composition book,  and write to her children,  she could even have 2 separate books for each child.  She decided on 1 because they had a good relationship.  She said it was hard at first,  anger came out, grief was hard, crying as she wrote.  However, this was cathartic and she arrived at a place where she started to share here feelings with them.  Her love, memories, hopes and dreams that would not come to be.And late in the third month, she was writing to them everyday, letting them now, what the family and her were doing.When she talked to her therapist she agreed to see him once a month.  within 2 years she was writing only occasionally.  She realized that unconsciously she was letting go.  She then had therapy on an on call basis. I was memorized by this lady, we both have devastating histories,  but I think her joy and loss, then rebound slowly back into the presence is beyond what I could do.   She sad no,  it was not any different than what my journaling does for me.So weary,  I urge you to try this.  Or ask your doctor about this.  I can't remember, if you are in therapy if you are ask about it.

Some people can't be reasoned with.So if a person with mental illness is given good and positive advice by a therapist, and he or she is too depressed to believe it, does that mean the advice didn't help the individual?Not necessarily. Sometimes a person isn't helped at first because he/she doesn't believe the advice.  However, over time, the person may come to believe it.  It may take weeks, months, or even years. But over time, the therapist can make a difference in the life of the person with helpful advice.It's often a slow process.  However, over time, the good advice can get through to those battling mental illness.  It just takes time."

Before I had crps I was a well rounded competent individual with the memory of an elephant...I have had ptsd for awhile but now I have sever depression to the point I actually tried to kill myself by slitting my wrist and taking over 15 30mg percocet... my body threw up the percocet on it's own and now i have 10 stitches in my wrist. I have never tried to commit suicide before crps. I now have split personality disorder, depression, bipolar polar, generalized anxiety disorder, paranoia,  my short term memory is totally gone and I struggle every day on whether to keep living... with my therapist she actually listens to what I say and most of the time I come up with my own answers and she helps try to find a reason to keep living. Everyone is different and every therapist is different. You can see 100 different therapists and they will each have their own way of handling your particular situation.  Now as other people have said there a some people in this world that cant get help because when they are getting help they still dont feel as if they are so they refuse the help. Now when I first started going to therapy I was a person who went only because my family begged me to get help. I didnt believe in therapy and figured there was noone out there that can relate to me so when I first started going I turned deaf ears on my therapist and we actually sat there for 5 sessions and barely said anything because I refused to talk... she said something's to me then that while in the moment i could have cared less but over time i started thinking about what she was telling me and now we are talking to each other and i actually listen to what she says...sometimes i still dont get everything she says but it doesnt mean it doesnt help. So i guess to answer the actual question... even if it doesnt seem to help immediately it doesnt mean that it doesnt help in the end..now if a person is going to commit suicide they will find a way and do it no matter what but that one sentance may...just may be what saves that person's life down the road. So remember...you dont know what the next person is dealing with...be kind to others as you never know...that act of kindness may just be the reason that person doesnt kill him/herself or someone else. We all struggle with stuff but you never know what can help someone else.Post Edited By Moderator (getting by) : 10/16/2019 4:19:39 AM (GMT-6)"

I forgot that this minister's sermons always seem to be triggering for me.  Sometimes I get teary eyed and it's not because I'm moved by his message.  I can't really put my finger on it because he's a nice guy and doesn't preach fire and brimstone.  Anyway, I'd like to be relaxed when I do go to church and not feel down for the rest of the day.Double Depression (dysthymia with intermittent MDD), Pre-diabetes, osteoarthritis both hips with replacements 3/1/2017 and 1/8/2019"

                "comment": "So I know it's been awhile, but I only see my therapist every two weeks.  The first two sessions were kind of for prep.  Today I did the real thing, using headphones with alternating beeps instead of eye movement.  We are working through the issue of shame, which is pervasive in my life.  We went back all the way to an incident n school when I was 7.  Interestingly enough, it makes me feel kind of ashamed to do this because I don't have what I would consider PTSD.  I have been very fortunate in my life not to have suffered any trauma and sometimes this makes me feel like I am just faking being depressed.  Anyway, I kinda went off topic.  I'll let you know how it goes.Double Depression (dysthymia with intermittent MDD), Pre-diabetes, osteoarthritis both hips with replacements 3/1/2017 and 1/8/2019"

                "comment": "So I was on my way home from running errands today when I suddenly got very depressed.  Maybe because it's the first time I hadn't been busy since my therapy appt on Wednesday.  My therapist told me to imagine somewhere I could put all the negative thoughts and feelings and I pictured a big wall of clear plastic totes, like at the Container Store.  But today I kept needing a bigger and bigger container.  It made me think of the Boggarts from Harry Potter.  They are creatures that represent one's worst fears and hide in closets.  But you just imagine them looking silly, like wearing a clown suit or something, wave your wand and say \"Ridiculoso!\" and they disappear.

It started with not sleeping through the night which is unusual for me and then the frequent crying came back. A few days ago I was listening to a podcast that unexpectedly got into a lot of existential stuff related to meditating that previously wouldn\u2019t have bothered me and I may have found it interesting but since about a year ago I can\u2019t listen to it. I had to shut it off half way through because it made me feel totally detached, feeling of dread and not like myself and I feel like I\u2019ve gone totally backwards. I\u2019m trying to pull out any tools I can think of to ground myself, doing lots of art and keeping as busy as possible but it does get me freightened that this is happening and is making it hard to enjoy things because I feel somewhat separated from it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!"

I mean sort of in the sense that something within the process has instigated a mind response and thus it's safety mechanism has been tripped.Fear not....breathe through it. I am safe or a mantra of the same effect. This type of situations are common, and it doesn't always pertsin to unresolved issues....the ill informed always believe so.We we get into a funk via something that you are experiencing or for no reason our mind is more susceptible to emotive and sensitivities and triggers than when we are more stable.Your tool box...good on ya. The reason this is happening can be something your mind may see as a trigger...it could be just benign it may have relevance but if it does not then correct your mind.

Like they mentioned, it sounds like something triggered you. I think one of the things that has helped me lately is just being aware of what's happening. The last time around I thought I was actually losing it. But now I know it's how my mind responds to stress or a trigger. I have an app called Smiling Mind that I use at night sometimes to help me get to sleep. There are many different guided meditations, but I typically always use the sleep one.I wish you well!"

Bad, very bad thoughts, depression, what's the point etc..But though experience my logical brain knew this would pass.  YES, it is hard to hold on to that, but I found since I journal,  tagging pages in my journals and going back to read the times I came through depressive episodes helps a lot. Also. write what I feel and how I feel about the situation.  Not holding back anything,  gets a lot of that emotion out.  Do not know if that would help you,  just saying.Hope you feel better soon.

Absolutely Trina, that\u2019s kind of how these ~two weeks went too, I tried to remind myself frequently that I\u2019ve been through this before and have had long periods of good times in between and that definitely helped, probably the most helpful thing I did. I should start journaling, but I haven\u2019t been able to really get going with that, I do most re art journaling but a written would be more helpful. I hope you too continue to have better days!"
